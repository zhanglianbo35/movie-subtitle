00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,360
Germany lies before us.

14
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,920
And Germany is Hitler.

15
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,320
The truth.

16
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,080
All we want is the truth is always
being said about Germany.

17
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:37,880
The truth is getting increased
by creative art of modern political

18
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:50,000
campaign which unveils new, strong,
beautiful, proud and really happy life.

19
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,200
A life which we can present before
an international public anytime.

20
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:16,200
Wherever we look constructing is in
process and new order is being built.

21
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,560
The national social justice
is foundation of our state.

22
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,400
The nation which neglects the purity
of its race will perish.

23
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,960
JEWS GET OUT!

24
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,240
Long live national socialism...

25
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,400
Long live Germany...

26
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,720
Doctor Kaufmann!

27
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,800
Doctor Kaufmann!

28
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,120
Miss Kaufmann, assistant surgeon
is expecting you to come.

29
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,920
Just a moment.

30
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
- Going for an injection?
- Yes, I am.

31
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,920
Remember the things for room 13.

32
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,440
The 2nd Republic, dear colleague, must
correct many mistakes.

33
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,600
And must accept many requests
presented by a new period.

34
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,280
Professor believes that you'd better
precede the measures

35
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,400
what sooner or later you'd be
ordered to do anyway.

36
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,600
You can still practice medicine
elsewhere,

37
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,000
unless you want to do
another job.

38
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,640
For example some trading,
Miss Kaufmann.

39
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,520
JEWS GET OUT!

40
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,760
- Hanka...
- No, Tonik.

41
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,920
It was a goal! The goal!

42
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,240
It's not true!
The dog crossed my line!

43
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,920
What you mean?
She's tided up!

44
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,200
Miss, that doesn't count.
Because of dog.

45
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,080
You're not right, it's 4:2.

46
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,080
Quiet, Honzik.
Hanka, where have you been?

47
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,880
- You children will be death of me.
- Wait a minute, so come on!

48
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,480
I am definitely leaving.

49
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm not waiting for Hitler to bring
his racial laws also here.

50
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,440
And what are you going to do abroad?

51
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,480
I'll finish my studies.

52
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,360
I can be a waiter, a porter. I can sell
newspapers. It's not important.

53
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,960
But I'll be free.

54
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,680
Hana, come with me.

55
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,800
- Zdenek, please...
- Hana, doctor Bures is here.

56
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,200
Please come in, doctor.

57
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,120
What a surprise, welcome.
Come in.

58
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,520
My friend for many years
and our neighbor Zdenek Klein.

59
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,040
Please meet doctor Bures.

60
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,960
What a pity.

61
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,640
And you are not going to leave?

62
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,400
Hanka, please, marry me.

63
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,720
- What's got into you, Tonik?
- You might need someone besides.

64
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,640
Is that the reason to get marry?
- I didn't mean it like that.

65
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
I know.

66
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,000
JEWS GET OUT!

67
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,880
I want to look great for the theatre.

68
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,440
- You really like nice things, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

69
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,760
I love getting dressed up.

70
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,120
You know, Tonik, I couldn't say
good-bye to all this.

71
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,560
May I?

72
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,680
This is my grandpa and grandma.
And auntie Amalia.

73
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,400
Uncle Karel and their children.

74
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,920
And this is uncle Adolf.

75
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,800
- Good evening.
- Daddy.

76
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,000
Mummy told me
that you've already come, doctor.

77
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,200
My dear, you know we are not allowed
to come to the theatre since yesterday.

78
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,400
NO ENTRY FOR JEWS

79
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,920
FORARYANS ONLY

80
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,320
STRONG RULES FOR JEWS
IN PROTECTORATE

81
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,520
JEWS NOT WELCOME

82
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,920
NO ENTRY FOR JEWS

83
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,360
JEWS NOTALLOWED IN THE PARK

84
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,120
NO ENTRY FOR JEWS AND DOGS

85
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,240
Jews have also been thrown out
of the state offices.

86
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,240
Jewish lawyers can't practice.

87
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:44,040
Our Honzik can't go to the sport clubs,
probably not even to school shortly.

88
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,160
Life will be hard for all of us...

89
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,680
I won't wait for my death here.
- And where do you suppose to wait?

90
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,000
Refugees are still being accepted
in Brazil.

91
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,240
The Pick family has left for Canada. One
of our relatives lives in Puerto Rico.

92
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,000
JEWS GET OUT!

93
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,240
What language they speak in Puerto Rico,
children? - Spanish, Mummy.

94
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,920
I'll write to uncle Richard
in the States. He will help.

95
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,120
Uncle Richard in the States,
but I think... - To America!

96
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,960
Don't be upset, Daddy,
but I'm not going.

97
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,360
Hana, it's because of that doctor?

98
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:07,560
No, Mum, I just belong here, it's my
culture, language, people, everything.

99
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,320
You mean it's not the same for me?

100
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:16,800
It's not easy to leave. But to stay
will not help to anyone.

101
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,800
And you don't mind the doctor
is a Christian?

102
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,640
For me she is a Jewess!

103
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,320
I've come to say I'm getting marry
and I don't like you talk like that.

104
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,920
You shouldn't have come at all!

105
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,600
Dad will think it over, Tonik.
He is a good man.

106
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,320
Yes. And what are you doing now?

107
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,000
Me?

108
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,440
Well, just be careful, man,
be careful.

109
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,880
They say you have got some cloth
for Jews.

110
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,600
Cloth?

111
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,480
Have I got any cloth?

112
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,960
Show me.

113
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:38,680
- And you want to buy some?
- Maybe. Maybe, I would buy some.

114
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:48,000
- You won't like it.
- If I don't like it, I won't buy it.

115
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,520
It's precious stuff.

116
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,320
So, do you like the new cloth?

117
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:15,640
Will new dress suit well to your
daughter for Chanukah?

118
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,040
The Middle Ages.

119
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,640
Where's Mummy?

120
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,120
Mummy!

121
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:09,800
They distribute call-up cards again.
Doctor Meixner, Kohn, Walla, Kraus.

122
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,040
- Transport.
- They want to send us to Poland.

123
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,640
- They prepare transports.
- To Terezin.

124
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,480
It's transport.
- You, too, Zdenek?

125
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,160
I wanted to keep it
for the end of the war.

126
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,920
- Hana will come in a minute.
- It's year 1929, Tonik.

127
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,080
There is a music school upstairs.
Sometimes I compete with them.

128
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,360
Today you can, Honzik,
today it's allowed.

129
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,280
My cousin hid it into a toothpaste,
I'd try the same.

130
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,720
They wouldn't check it, would they?
What you mean, professor?

131
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,240
So, children, let's make a toast.

132
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,920
- Wedding turkey will be served after war.
- Let's hope, let's hope it will be.

133
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,760
To safe journey.

134
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,120
- Do you remember, dear...
- Mummy.

135
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,760
Just a minute, Honzik. When Emma
was getting married you remember...

136
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,760
That'll be my parents.

137
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,160
- Hello.
- Hello, Tonik.

138
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,920
Dad has not come, has he?

139
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,680
No, he hasn't.

140
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,280
Listen, wasn't there any house
search at your place?

141
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,920
- What you mean?
- You know, they are after me.

142
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,040
We all have our own worries.

143
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,880
It's Pepa, what a pleasure!
It's nice you have come.

144
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,320
Cheers, Hana!

145
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,160
- Dad has not come?
- Daddy sends his greetings.

146
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,280
You know, he's got a lot of work.

147
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,080
- Shouldn't we already leave?
- To leave...

148
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,000
We've forgotten about cup.
Cup must be.

149
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,680
Stand up, Tonik.

150
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,880
For good luck.

151
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,760
What happened?

152
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,440
Don't you mind working
in a factory because of Hana?

153
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,360
- Of course, I don't.
- You don't...

154
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,200
It's the transport, Hana, isn't it?
- Yes, Mum.

155
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,240
We expected it sooner or later.

156
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,600
They've already taken Plesner as well.

157
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,920
- Your wife doesn't leave?
- No.

158
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,960
The wives of Aryans
don't have to... yet.

159
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,480
Why haven't you shown your wife
to me yet?

160
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,200
Because the German lords have forbidden
to Jews to use the train.

161
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,160
The German lords...

162
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:40,280
So, you want double-soled shoes
to hide money in. - Thanks, Daddy.

163
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,840
Don't you know anything about Pepa?

164
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,240
...they were condemned
to the death sentence...

165
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,640
Broken china means good luck.

166
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:49,560
And the sofa what Honzik used, will it
stay here? - Get out!

167
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,200
But we will be back again.

168
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:16,200
Ruhe! Los!

169
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,440
- What is it?
- Your authorization to Germans.

170
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,880
You provide it of your own accord,
without restraint, it's your free will.

171
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,240
- And you confirm you're mentally fit.
- Was ist denn los da!

172
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,360
Achtung!

173
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,240
Heil Hitler!

174
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,640
Sie lacht.

175
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,440
Verfluchte...

176
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,680
Weiter!

177
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,960
- Are you doctor Kaufmann?
- Yes.

178
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,120
I'd like to talk to you.
- Please, come in.

179
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,320
Who's that man?

180
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,520
He is my husband.

181
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,240
I'm serving in Terezin.

182
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,920
Do you know anything about parents?
Have you any message?

183
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,040
They said to write you everything.

184
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,880
Please, come and sit down.

185
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,960
But I have some more messages
to deliver.

186
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,160
If you wish to send something,
I'll stop by next week.

187
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,040
Yes, please, come again.
Thanks a lot.

188
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,760
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

189
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,640
Look, Tonik, here is...

190
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,680
It's very dangerous, doctor.

191
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,880
- Well, we'll see.
- Thank you. Thanks a lot.

192
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,640
Please, I don't want my wife knows
about. I'll tell her I'm going home.

193
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,880
They need money.

194
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,840
Tonik, have we already sold
all the jewels?

195
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,560
Only one Grandma's ring remains.

196
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,440
I hope you won't mind to sell it.

197
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,200
Not at all, don't worry.

198
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,560
But I don't understand this. Why does
Daddy need black hair dye?

199
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,200
Black hair dye?

200
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,600
Did you see my family?

201
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,120
- They're sending their greetings.
- How are they?

202
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,200
They are fine.

203
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,200
They only wonder why you need
black hair dye.

204
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,600
They are sending us further.
To Poland.

205
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,040
Transports.
They kill old people straight away.

206
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,080
- Are you sure?
- And do you know who?

207
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,360
- Madler, Brychta.
- And Kohn, Kohn as well.

208
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,680
Do you hear that?
It's here again.

209
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,280
You bastard, let me be.

210
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,720
- Where did you get it?
- You mean the bread? I nipped it.

211
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,200
With kisses H.

212
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,080
Do you see that?

213
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,600
Oh, my dear...

214
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,240
Los!

215
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,880
Los!

216
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,760
Weiter gehen!

217
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,040
Weiter!
Nicht umdrehen!

218
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,400
Come in.

219
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,320
- Do come in!
- I'm already here.

220
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,320
You didn't turn, so I knocked
once more.

221
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,160
You must be Mr. Noha.

222
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:26,400
Cheguered cap, heart of gold.
Tonik has already told me about you.

223
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,240
- Please, take a seat.
- Thank you.

224
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,560
Tonik says he would be lost without you
in a factory.

225
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:38,400
It was bad in the beginning, but now
he's already making good rejects.

226
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,240
- Barytosis?
- Yes, exactly.

227
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,000
You know, Tonik wasn't in a factory
today.

228
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,280
And someone has brought an important
message from his home town.

229
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,520
Has anything happened to Pepa?

230
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,400
The lads who come here
from Borek told us

231
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,480
that yesterday evening Gestapo
came to the house.

232
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,040
They brought handcuffed Pepa
with them.

233
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,480
They turned the whole house
upside down.

234
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,200
And have left in the night, taking Dad
with them.

235
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,320
One man - back from work.

236
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,840
Weg!

237
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,880
Aport!

238
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,520
Was hast du?

239
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:27,760
So, ein Saujude
muss doch immer was haben.

240
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,600
Excuse me, please.

241
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,040
Please, is the Kaufmann family
living there?

242
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,120
Ich begresse nicht.

243
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,760
Please, don't you know
the Kaufmann family?

244
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,240
Kaufmanns? I don't know them.

245
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,280
Excuse me, the Kaufmann family?
Do they live here?

246
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,160
eges gojier kopf.

247
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,240
Please, don't you know where
the Kaufmanns live?

248
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,840
Oskar and Hedvika Kaufmann.

249
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,200
Get away!
It's you, Bures...

250
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,080
Explain to Hana that I couldn't.

251
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,120
God knows I couldn't keep them here.

252
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,240
But you seem to have a great
influence here, haven't you?

253
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,200
Well, maybe a little.

254
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,920
You think it was easy to save myself,
my mother and brother?

255
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,640
You say to save.

256
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,760
Quiet!

257
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,440
I know.
The one who has no own experience...

258
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,120
Bondy,
537.

259
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,720
Let me smoke a little.

260
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,880
Where did you get it?

261
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,880
You want me, don't you?

262
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,240
- What are you doing here, Margit?
- I just wanted...

263
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,320
What's that?

264
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,640
- Where did you get it?
- Let her be.

265
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,320
It's mine, I've got it!
- Leave her.

266
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,280
Are you mad?

267
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,760
- A cig here means gallows or Oswiecim!
- Be quiet.

268
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,960
And have a cigarette as well.

269
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,240
Don't be surprised.

270
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:56,920
I don't want to get into transport.

271
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:02,920
And where are all those transports
going?

272
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,400
Oswiecim, Majdanek, Treblinky.

273
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,800
Oswiecim, Majdanek, Treblinky.

274
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,760
I've got to switch off the light.
- What if I...

275
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,320
May I hide somewhere here?

276
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,000
To hide? Here?

277
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,400
Lie down here.

278
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:15,800
...Oswiecim, Majdanek, Treblinky,

279
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,520
Oswiecim, Majdanek, Treblinky...

280
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,360
Thank God you are here.

281
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,000
- Thank God.
- What's the matter, Hanka?

282
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,360
I was so much afraid.

283
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,240
You know I was...?

284
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,600
- Noha came and told me everything.
- What you mean?

285
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:19,280
About Pepa, searching the house.

286
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,680
And about your Dad as well.

287
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:32,120
I was so afraid they'd still be there
waiting for your coming.

288
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:39,640
No, they all were away when I came.

289
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,080
Do you know he took five people
yesterday?

290
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,120
Including fifteen year old boy
in Löw family.

291
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,600
- Who? Müller?
- Because they had a beer at home.

292
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,440
As if they couldn't have done
without a beer.

293
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,560
If it wasn't a beer, they'd have found
something else.

294
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,480
They took Stastny family
because of newspapers.

295
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,360
Next for an injection!

296
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,320
Bures!

297
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,280
Are you doctor Antonin Bures?

298
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,120
I'm a policeman.

299
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,960
The Czech police.

300
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,960
Why you still keep to blame
yourself, Hana?

301
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:08,280
Because of me, my parents and Honzik
did not leave.

302
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:13,680
- Now even Tonik, just because of me...
- You know nothing yet.

303
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,560
Work camps for Aryan husbands
may just be a nonsense.

304
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,040
If Tonik got...

305
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:27,360
If he got a divorce,
would he have to go?

306
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:34,120
No, he wouldn't.
But you would be sent to Terezin.

307
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,040
But you know Tonik well.
He won't divorce.

308
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:43,600
No, you are right.
It's not the way.

309
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,960
It wouldn't work like that.

310
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,720
Sir, may I have few days off?

311
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:00,760
Of course, Hana.
We'll manage without you.

312
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,520
- Excuse me, doctor!
- Just a moment.

313
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,440
Hello. Yes, she's here.

314
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,440
It's Tonik.

315
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,840
Hello, Tonik.
Where are you calling from?

316
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:26,520
From a phone booth.
Well, Hanka, listen...

317
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,160
Are you busy now?

318
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,240
There's no one here anymore.

319
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,520
What happened?

320
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:42,200
Nothing. I just wanted to talk
to you, you know.

321
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,880
You are going straight home,
aren't you?

322
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,160
I don't know.

323
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,680
I would like to be alone for a while.

324
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,840
Hanka... Hanka, hello!

325
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,600
Someone still keeps knocking here.
Hanka, are you on night duty today?

326
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,160
Night duty?

327
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:08,160
Yes, I am.

328
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,440
- See you, then, Hanka.
- Tonik!

329
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,520
I'm just looking at the balcony
opposite.

330
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,760
There's a child playing there.

331
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,960
Such a lovely child...

332
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:35,200
Good-bye, Hana.
Good-bye.

333
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,840
Good-bye, Tonik.

334
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,560
Sterbeurkunde: Mauthaussen 1304
Josef Bures

335
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,360
Rudolf Bures 1302
auf der Flucht erschossen.

336
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,080
Hanka...

337
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,560
Hana...

338
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,720
Tonik...

339
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,800
Hanka...

340
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,360
Let's go.
We'll go together.

341
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,240
But I have promised it to Tonik.

342
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:34,040
I'm telling you, my wife is waiting.

343
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,880
Pack your things and move to our place.
The Germans will not find you there!

344
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:46,040
Aren't I right?
You'll have a nice room there.

345
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:50,520
We'll take care of you as Tonik wanted.
Believe me, you'll see.

346
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:54,240
And how you got known... Who told you
that I am to leave for Terezin?

347
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:58,720
Tonik has managed it at Jewish office
before they took him away.

348
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,960
No, Mr. Noha, forgive me, but
I'm not going with you.

349
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:16,120
They all have already gone, even Tonik.
Why should I stay here?

350
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,160
- But, madam, you know...
- And moreover...

351
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,320
You know what would expect you
in the case they would find me.

352
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,200
But what about Tonik?
He wanted you to stay.

353
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,200
No one is alone.

354
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,600
Los!

355
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,160
Weg! Weg!

356
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,880
Weiter! Los!

357
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,280
Komm! Komm!

358
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,880
Geh mal!

359
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,560
Komm, komm! Schnell!

360
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,680
Go to sleep!

361
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,120
Next one!

362
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,120
Excuse me, please.

363
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,760
Here you are, we don't want you
to starve. - Thank you.

364
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,800
I've got a date later, you know.

365
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,840
Shut up!

366
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,880
- Where did you get it?
- This?

367
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,360
Some woman left it here.
She went to the gas chamber.

368
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,520
With kisses H.

369
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:40,000
Are you mad? Hanka!

370
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,960
Hana!

371
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:48,200
It's you, Zdenek.
- How long have you been here?

372
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:53,040
I knew you'd end up here.
Why did he let you go?

373
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:56,120
I told him not to let you go,
in any case.

374
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:59,320
Whom did you tell?

375
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,720
I said it to Tonda when he was here.

376
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,680
Tonik was...?

377
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,360
Come with me, Hana.

378
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,680
What are you staring at?
Make off!

379
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,120
What's going on?

380
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,880
I'm waiting if they close the door.

381
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,720
- Did they close?
- No, they didn't.

382
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,680
What are you doing here?

383
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,160
They must be expecting international
inspection.

384
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,000
Hana!

385
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,960
Move to my place.
Do you hear me?

386
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,720
You'll get another work.

387
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,600
Are you mad?

388
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,040
Achtung!

389
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,920
Achtung!

390
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,480
Melde fünfzig Frauen
zur Verschönerung!

391
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,560
Weiter machen!

392
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,760
Weiter machen!

393
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,240
Weiter!

394
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,760
It's OK!

395
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,840
Yes, OK.

396
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,920
What's this for?

397
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,080
He's asking what is this for.

398
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,960
Why should I know?
And why are you bricking this up?

399
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,080
What?

400
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,280
Why are you bricking up?

401
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,840
He wants to know why are we
bricking this up?

402
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,480
Transport.

403
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,280
What did you say?

404
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:49,920
Transport with children
from the east has arrived.

405
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,600
Transport?

406
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,320
Take your clothes off.

407
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,720
Get undressed.

408
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,880
It's gas, it's gas, gas!

409
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,280
Stay! Stay here!

410
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,640
Gas!

411
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,360
Gas!

412
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:04,160
You're building a gas chamber!

413
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,880
Gas!

414
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,120
We are building a gas chamber!

415
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,080
Did you hear that?
It's gas!

416
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:22,160
I knew that, do you hear me?
Do you hear? I knew that!

417
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,480
Ours are back!

418
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:45,120
No one returns from camp alive.
It's transport with typhoid victims!

419
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,960
Don't go there! The plaque will spread
over the town!

420
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,000
Hana!

421
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,000
- Transport.
- Gas!

422
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,480
- Transport has arrived.
- There are dead people! - Transport?

423
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:11,240
It's typhoid. Typhoid transport!
- Don't go there!

424
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,560
Freedom!

425
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:24,600
There are tanks!
Tanks over there!

426
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:02,000
Mankind has won.

427
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:14,280
Oswiecim, Majdanek, Treblinky,

428
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:20,480
Golnov, Ravensbrück, Oranienburg,

429
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:27,920
Bergen-Belsen, Buchenwald,
Lodz, Terezin,

430
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:32,560
Gross-Rosen, Mauthausen.

431
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:38,680
Seven million of people
died in concentration camps

432
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,960
of fascist Germany.

433
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:46,280
Over 140 thousand of people from
the whole Europe went through Terezin.

434
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:50,960
And just a few of them
have survived.
