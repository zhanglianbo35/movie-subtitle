THE KINGDOM OF CARPATHIA

24
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,954
Doctor Blutwurst was right.

25
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,151
This air is a balm.

26
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,158
Take deep breaths, your Lordship.

27
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:36,399
You'll be as fit as a fiddle.
- Who wants to be a fiddle?

28
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,628
Forgive me.
- To forget the dreadful past.

29
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,717
I need new impressions.

30
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,991
Magnificent!

31
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,832
A setting for "The Vampire's Curse".

32
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:57,316
Act two, Waldemar's aria.

33
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,147
My star role at the Dresden opera.

34
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,955
Do you remember?
- Indeed I do!

35
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,830
Your Lordship fell into
the orchestra pit.

36
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,709
Wondrous memories!

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,877
This wild region inspires me.

38
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,158
All these totem poles.

39
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,151
A magnificently primitive people.

40
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:34,269
Why do all these sticks
point to the Castle?

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,754
Sticks?
Primitive, effective sculptures.

42
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:45,355
That's no sculpture.

43
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,394
It is not.

44
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,552
Poor young man!

45
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,833
Where is she?

46
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,793
Who?

47
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,473
She!

48
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,555
Some brandy might bring him round.

49
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,072
Stop!

50
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,238
Don't shoot!

51
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,072
I have many children and
this horse to feed.

52
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,108
Do not fear us.
We have a sick man here.

53
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,629
Can you help us?
- Yes indeed.

54
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,028
But I am no physician,

55
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,069
only the local teacher -
on my way to Werewolfsville.

56
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,675
But that is our destination!

57
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,718
Here is the sick man.

58
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,119
Poor girl!

59
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,954
This is a man!
- And what a man.

60
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,348
Villia the gamekeeper.

61
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,588
I pitied his poor bride,
our Mayor's daughter.

62
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,795
LATER - IN WEREWOLFSVILLE

63
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,879
Villia, oh Villia!

64
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,879
This was bound to happen.

65
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,108
Snooping round Devil's Castle again,
the nosey parker.

66
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,875
He isn't a nosey parker,
he's a civil servant!

67
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,956
Put him in the tap-room.

68
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,076
He is my betrothed.

69
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,874
I shall tend him in my chamber!
- Whoever heard of...

70
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,512
Oh, come on.

71
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,557
The barms ve been read.

72
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,158
Get going, then!

73
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,036
Do not strain yourself, your Lordship.

74
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,988
Count Teleke von Tölökö
will spend the night here.

75
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,389
I ve had some grand toffs sleep here.

76
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,836
Even General Battledie.

77
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,952
After the battle at Battledom.

78
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,827
Next morning he said:

79
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:54,630
I sure as shit lost that battle,

80
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,230
but I didn't lose my sleep.

81
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,995
Words fit for marble.

82
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,795
That picturesque castle again.

83
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,199
The tower points upwards like
a threatening finger.

84
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,911
Genuine Meissen!

85
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,028
This wondrous goblet guarded

86
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,948
like a gem-it's name is Graal...

87
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,269
This invigorating climate!

88
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,118
Add it to the bill.

89
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,229
Vallia is delirious!

90
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:04,509
Old Doc can't come -
the sacristan's cow's calving.

91
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,828
May I offer the balm
of an imported medicine?

92
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,355
Oh, imported?

93
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,437
Thank you kindly, Sir.

94
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,712
The young lady has an erudite diction.

95
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,638
She's had her schooling.

96
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,870
Dear father, the Convent School for

97
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,028
Christian Maidensis hardly a university.

98
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,037
The Slovak drug.

99
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,190
A true wonder!

100
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,552
The fever just sizzled away.

101
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,236
I am happy to hear that.

102
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,596
When will the young man tell us
what caused his fatal state?

103
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,678
In the morning, maybe.
- If he lives to see daylight!

104
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,190
His malady isn't serious.

105
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,989
You never can tell with
this Devil of a Castle!

106
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,995
Don't bother the gentleman.

107
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,436
Tom's deaf and dumb.

108
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:35,197
Won't hurt a fly, though.

109
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,469
He sells scapulars to ward off
the evil spirits.

110
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,873
Cross his palm with silver.

111
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,596
The gamekeeper's been to the Castle?

112
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,432
Can't keep away.
Cause of the haunting.

113
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,198
What haunting?

114
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,149
The usual stuff.

115
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,395
Rattling and screeching and such.

116
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,349
Odd lights, they say.
- They say?!

117
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,510
Saw them with my own eyes!

118
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,558
A flamin arrow shot up

119
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:16,116
tall as the bally bell-tower!

120
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,871
Why is the place haunted?

121
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,999
Why?

122
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,030
Devil's Castle!

123
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:46,509
It's haunted!

124
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,955
But why?

125
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,749
Long, long ago a tribe of
robber knights settled at the Castle.

126
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,788
They robbed merchants,
murdered pilgrims.

127
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:33,229
Their evil deeds brought them to hell.

128
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,708
The Devill made them...

129
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:03,869
...haunt...

130
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,828
...haunt that Castle like mad.

131
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,749
Unbearable it was.

132
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,028
The robber knights decided to move on.

133
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:36,749
They left the Castle to the ghosts...

134
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,360
...and the bats.

135
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,991
Quite the local Homer.

136
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,275
This castle is intriguing.

137
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,318
When I feel fit once more

138
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:14,828
I shall go and explore
and tease those ghosts of yours!

139
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,668
You d do better to hear out
the gamekeeper first.

140
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:35,109
That's right, his Lordship had better
sit on his arse!

141
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,150
Such, strong, hearty expressions!

142
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,235
A charming dialect!

143
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,755
I feel reborn.

144
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,349
These are the new impressions

145
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:59,110
my doctor so highly recommended.

146
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,389
An ancient people, romantic ruins,
ghosts and magic.

147
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,149
May I ask what your Lordship
thinks of these horrors?

148
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,196
I think highly of them.

149
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,349
Would it not be magnificent if flaming
arrows really

150
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,068
did fly from that devil's haunt?

151
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,392
Unfortunately however,

152
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,514
such poetic phenomena
belong to the realm of lore and legend.

153
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,399
More's the pity.

154
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:36,269
My poor master will never forget her.

155
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,953
Villia, my love!
Tell me what happened.

156
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,833
I dunno.

157
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,358
How come you don t?

158
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:10,028
I arrived at the Castle and then...

159
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,268
Then what?

160
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:33,709
Then... I don't remember nothing.

161
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,755
A typical case of amnesia.

162
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:46,548
Loss of memory after
a devastating experience.

163
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,078
This gang of robbers is up to
its tricks again.

164
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,958
But courageous they always were,
these Knights of Gorz.

165
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,756
Their coat-of-arms featured a beard
chopped of a Sultan.

166
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,472
Gorz?

167
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,309
Yes, the Gorzes of Gorzeny,
the castle owners.

168
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,999
Robert Gorz?

169
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,758
Then maybe she...

170
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,470
Stop singing such slush!

171
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,229
A civil servant should sing only
the national anthem.

172
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,271
VILLIA RECO VERED

173
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,275
Robert Gorz disappeared.

174
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,757
This could be his hiding-place!

175
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,989
Unbelievable.
I came here to forget.

176
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:40,718
And suddenly new hope blossoms
on the horizon!

177
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,792
If that crazy man is here,

178
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,516
she is here too-against her will,
of course!

179
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,588
But your Lordship-me think this ruin
must be uninhabited.

180
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,993
The most famous of her arias.

181
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,479
You must be an artist!

182
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,672
I can tell, because I know this melody.

183
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,111
But how do you come to know it?

184
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,711
Dunno, really.

185
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,398
Yes you do.

186
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,790
You play it just as she used to sing it.

187
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,993
I can still hear her angel's voice.

188
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:56,115
Pretty as an angel, too.

189
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,358
Who?

190
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,788
The Minister of Forestry and I had
the same wet-nurse.

191
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,868
Milk is thicker than water,
we remained suckling-siblings.

192
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,230
It would be a good thing for you
to refresh your memory.

193
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,715
So-what happened?

194
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,276
It's coming back to me.

195
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,028
I came to Devil's Castle,

196
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,878
and I looked up...

197
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,316
But what happened then,
I really dunno.

198
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:25,669
Your description is lucid.
It is she!

199
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,236
I must see her!
- Me too!

200
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,759
Now I understand.

201
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,354
You could not let your bride see
how carried away you were

202
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:41,355
by just one look at this divine beauty.

203
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,637
She d give me hell, she would.

204
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,115
Listen, young man.

205
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:54,989
This godlike creature is
a world-renown singer,

206
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:02,028
but first and foremost
she is my betrothed.

207
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,548
Congratulations, your Lordship.
- Offered prematurely.

208
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,868
She is held prisoner here by a rich
but crazy monster.

209
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,397
Holy smoke and gunshot!

210
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:19,388
We'll ave to act and fast!

211
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,596
Noble son of these noble peaks!

212
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,833
You d go with me?
- Yes.

213
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,709
Your Lordship would do well
to think it over.

214
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,750
I already have.

215
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,548
Go back to Werewolfsville.
Right now!

216
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,434
Not a word to those chicken-hearts about
our going to the Castle.

217
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,556
She d give me hell.

218
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:50,068
Hire a carriage and rush to the police
prefect with this free-mason ring.

219
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,474
Explain the situation.

220
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,628
Should I not return within 24 hours

221
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,630
he must send a police corps
to take the castle by storm.

222
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,434
Oh God, no corpses!

223
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,318
Who will tend Your Lordship's
precious throat?

224
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,833
I shall.

225
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:21,038
It belongs not only to me,
but to the whole world.

226
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,951
Tom the dummie.

227
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,193
Bewitching, this folklore.

228
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,557
Give the poor creature a coin.

229
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,790
Forwards, young man!

230
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,192
Au revoir.

231
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,036
If only I could stay
at your Lordship's side.

232
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,111
You'll be at it again soon.

233
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:10,953
Au revoir, Master.

234
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,670
Call the police, would he?

235
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,190
We'll nip that in the bud.

236
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:18,028
We can see without being seen.

237
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,948
Let's get into the woods!

238
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:33,270
What's that?
Voice exercises.

239
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,636
Once in opera, mustn't stop.

240
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:42,308
I know I m uneducated Sir,
but what's "opera"?

241
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,199
Theatre with singing only.

242
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,550
Presented in maginficent halls

243
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,031
with the cream of society
bestowing their favours upon me.

244
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,992
Why upon you?

245
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:59,470
Because I am a famous singer.

246
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:05,308
I thought such showing off isn t
fitting for the gentry.

247
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,914
My father thought so too.

248
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,116
But let you be apprenticed for a singer.

249
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:15,670
Yes, the powers of my talent
made him give in.

250
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,954
My father no longer deterred me
from following my star.

251
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:53,028
To save my family embarrassment
I called myself IL CONTECANTO.

252
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,709
Hapless Moor of Venice,
you became my fate.

253
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,239
Our ways parted,

254
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:57,269
but thanks to modern
technology we were ever together.

255
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,472
Until one evening...

256
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,108
Come forthwith!
Salsa.

257
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,710
Never a second did I lose.

258
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,228
Why did she faint?

259
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,438
Don't interrupt!

260
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,670
Sorry.

261
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,597
She gave a magnificent performance.

262
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,949
I shall never forget -
I seem to hear her still.

263
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:21,958
Again-right now.

264
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,157
But what's the good.

265
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,351
Just a hallucination.

266
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,514
I can hear her too!

267
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,951
Yeah, that's her!

268
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:48,510
Take care, young man.
The Signorina is my betrothed.

269
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,998
Salsa!

270
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,838
WELCOME, COUNT TELEKE!

271
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,391
We are expected!

272
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,831
Watch out, your Lordship!

273
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,958
Better be sure than sorry.

274
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:21,313
Up with our courage!
I always get it up for Salsa!

275
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,197
Now we re in the coop.

276
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:16,909
No windows here!

277
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,797
A fairy-tale place.

278
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,039
Magnificent.

279
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,550
A Count?
A fool.

280
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,548
Fantastic.
Game, Chateau Dracula, vintage 80.

281
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,831
To happy tomorrows!

282
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,228
May success be our companion...

283
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,039
There's dynamite in that throat.

284
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:20,070
THE BREAKDO WN IS NOT ON YOUR SET

285
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,710
A dangerous enemy.

286
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,831
I must keep an eye on him.

287
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,231
Professor!

288
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,518
Just a moment!

289
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,237
I am about to send the 421st rocket
to the moon.

290
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:58,954
This time I shan't miss.

291
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,599
Stop that, there's something
more important.

292
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,197
Damn it all!

293
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,278
What's up?

294
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,237
A breakdown on the second program,
fix it at once.

295
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:47,715
The gentleman should not be present.

296
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,759
They won't be.

297
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,793
They'll be asleep in seconds.

298
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:39,632
Your Lordship!

299
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,112
Wake up!

300
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:57,833
Good morning, my friend.

301
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,398
A day spun of sheer gold.

302
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,675
The deuce take the gold,
there's a window!

303
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,989
There wasn't one yesterday.

304
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,713
You re right.

305
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:12,789
And it's the same room.

306
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,197
My mind's a blank.

307
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,512
However did I get to bed?

308
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,989
I have no recollection either.

309
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,835
Everything is ready for
a civilized gentleman.

310
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:36,755
Exemplary service.

311
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:39,159
I don't think!

312
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,036
Even a WC.
What's that?

313
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:57,436
From Orpheus and Eurydica.

314
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,358
This?

315
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,478
We are locked in.
Now we re in the soup.

316
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,277
But we are strong men.

317
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:20,471
Stand beside me,

318
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,715
when I say Hallelujah we rush forwards.

319
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,990
This brave mountain folk!

320
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:32,472
Hallelujah!

321
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,039
A miracle.

322
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:22,990
Yes, Quadrophonograph.

323
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:27,755
The Professor's invention.

324
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:34,349
Between you and me-he's mad,

325
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:39,391
stark staring mad, never-the-less...

326
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,434
Crazy, but a genius.

327
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,836
He discovers how chickens lay eggs.

328
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,353
But one thing he refuses to do -
to grow a beard.

329
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,155
I know that you...

330
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,592
Some heavenly Traviata.

331
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,193
Grandiose opera music,

332
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,869
I always dress
to be worthy of its magnificence.

333
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,759
Sir!
- All my ancestors loved music.

334
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,358
Applauded a man sentenced to death
who screamed a high C when tortured,

335
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:46,469
rewarded him at the execution with
fanfares by the Prague Trombone Players.

336
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:53,588
My adoration of opera has no limits.

337
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:57,472
Sir!

338
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:06,472
Souvenirs of their oreators.

339
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:16,358
Beethowen's umbrella,

340
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:24,668
Berlioz's baton, Richard Wagner's beret.

341
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,913
Tournados Rossini.

342
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,916
According to the living model.

343
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,592
That I do not doubt.

344
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,193
Your Lordship!

345
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,358
What's that?
- An apple.

346
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:55,114
With this I annul the pull of gravity.

347
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,596
Silly bits and pieces.

348
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:01,152
Invent a beard for yourself!

349
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,949
It needs perfecting.

350
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:12,952
Sir, I know...

351
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:17,432
Excuse me, I haven't introduced myself.

352
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:22,989
Do I have the honour -
Baron Gorz von Gorzeny?

353
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,313
And Count Tölökö of Teleke?

354
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:32,469
Teleke of Tölökö, not Tölökö of Teleke.

355
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,516
Of course - Tölökö of Teleke.

356
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,030
That's Professor Orphanic,
my personal inventor.

357
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:43,076
And technical revolutionary.

358
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:47,237
A pleasure.
Baron, I know that you have...

359
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,914
Your Lordship, that's Tom!

360
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:03,675
My betrothed is here,
I wish to speak to her this instant.

361
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,318
This instant?

362
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,708
Happy to oblige.
- Well, not this instant...

363
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,318
What was that?

364
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:26,670
Get yourself decent,
then I'll fulfill your wish.

365
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,557
Accompany the gentlemen!

366
00:53:27,159 --> 00:53:28,831
Here we go again.

367
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:33,193
OPERATION ROBERT THE DEVIL
Is there sufficient dynamite?

368
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,068
For total annihilation.

369
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,552
Great.

370
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,510
You do realize the test must take place
within 24 hours?

371
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:52,188
I have to point out that I have only

372
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:03,268
Who took you out of the Mental Home
where contrarevolutionaries placed you?

373
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,478
You did, Master.

374
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,554
Carbonize the coxhydrates!
- Right.

375
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:23,193
Thermate the nuclears!
- Right.

376
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:26,710
Accelerate the moderates!
- Right.

377
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,947
Heat up my sausage!
- Right.

378
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,672
A demon.

379
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,717
In human form.

380
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:53,789
How come your betrothed is with him?

381
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,039
Why?

382
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:01,954
That day when Salsa fainted on stage,

383
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:04,398
they took her to her changing-room.

384
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,989
The Doctor stated it had been
a heart attack.

385
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:19,469
She then confided the reason
for her anxiety.

386
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:23,072
Not long after our parting

387
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:27,311
the mysterious Baron Gorz
appeared in one of the boxes.

388
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:34,271
He followed me from opera to opera.

389
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,632
Bribed his way to get close to me.

390
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:44,550
I sent you a telegram

391
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:51,188
and bade the Baron
to free me of his presence.

392
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:58,193
He answered by return:
Goddess of my hearing.

393
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,590
Never again shall you see my face.

394
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:06,108
He kept his promise.

395
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,630
So that's why she fainted.

396
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,039
I can't go on.

397
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,438
This is stronger than I am.

398
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,956
I am a mere primadonna.

399
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:42,512
Do you love me?

400
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:50,309
How often did your receiver answer that
question with my inter-urban "yes"?!

401
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,672
Then everything is simple.

402
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,755
What?

403
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,429
Primadonna Salsa engaged to marry
Maestro Contecanto?

404
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,355
What?

405
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,148
She is giving up her career.
What?

406
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,471
She is to make her farewell in the role
of Princess Carola?

407
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,550
By her beloved's side?

408
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:26,110
You wily wailer, how dare you steal her
from me!

409
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,793
No, never!

410
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:43,028
Why are you so nervous this evening?

411
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,713
I have an evil premonition.

412
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,195
He is lying in wait out there.

413
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:00,956
I lost consciousness.

414
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:12,030
They took Salsa to her room
where she was to remain

415
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:16,032
until the doctor came
for the final examination.

416
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,869
But an hour later the room was changed.

417
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,557
Count Tölökö!
Now Salsa is mine for evermore.

418
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:41,827
Do not search for her if you
value your life.

419
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,032
I searched but in vain.

420
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:51,068
Close to the pits of madness over
Salsa's death

421
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,318
I yet cherished the hope
that my beloved lives.

422
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:59,436
Held captive by her crazy admirer
she must be going through hell,

423
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,432
but she is alive.

424
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:06,509
Sure thing.
You heard er, I saw her.

425
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:13,036
What I don't get is why that doctor
pronounced her dead.

426
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,079
That's easy to explain.

427
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:19,108
The Baron indubitably knows all
about hypnosis,

428
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:24,070
making the Signorina as rigid as if
she were dead.

429
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,436
Even the doctor was fooled.

430
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,958
You are right.

431
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:32,351
Absolutely right.

432
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:36,076
Listening at keyholes?

433
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:39,677
Naturally.
A practical occupation.

434
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,472
Let us go.
- Where?

435
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:49,954
You wished to see the Signorina.

436
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,949
Yes.
- Sorry.

437
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,793
This good youth is coming too.

438
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:05,989
I ve forgotten that you steal
pictures too.

439
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,755
Only for reasons of health.

440
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,958
I feel better already.

441
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:31,235
Something like acupuncture.
- Somewhat similar.

442
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,193
Our angel's life now lies in your hands.

443
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,157
I don't understand.
- You will.

444
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,117
Like the Holy Virgin.

445
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,958
Do you wish to kill her?

446
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,829
She has just fallen asleep.
Should she wake and see you,

447
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:56,389
her heart would give way.

448
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:07,552
Let us go.

449
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,913
Very good.

450
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:24,079
Holy smoke and gunshot!

451
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,398
Excellent!

452
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:32,237
Your beard is dependable.

453
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:41,028
I d stake a wager that her sleep
is caused by some devilish drug.

454
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:49,358
The vile scoundrel.
He holds her in a golden cage.

455
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:52,835
How do we get her out?

456
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,512
My inspiration will not fail me.

457
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:00,471
What's that?
- An artist's inner voice.

458
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,278
What's it saying?

459
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:05,039
Nothing as yet.

460
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,557
But-not to worry.

461
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:10,547
The police is on its way.

462
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:41,672
A cup of coffee!

463
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,438
More light!

464
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,398
What is that I see?

465
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,398
Hand over that telephorum!

466
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,797
The Prefect in person.

467
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:28,155
When will the rascals arrive?
- They re marching quickly.

468
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,110
But it'll take them two hours to mount
Bear Hill.

469
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:35,197
Then they'll take a rest.

470
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:40,228
They won't arrive before
tomorrow morning.

471
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:47,552
Dammit!

472
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,150
Professor!
- Coming!

473
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,913
Professor!

474
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,469
Coming!
This is an animal-electricity test.

475
01:07:03,159 --> 01:07:08,108
Operation Robert the Devil must be ready
on the morrow.

476
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:12,315
When will you test it?

477
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:17,231
Right now.

478
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,831
Operation test results-positive.

479
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:04,150
You achieved all that with just
one grain?

480
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:05,795
Yes.

481
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,467
Half a pound of Orphanic is sufficient
for the whole operation.

482
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:10,152
No economizing!

483
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:13,552
Shall I have the charges set?
- Of course!

484
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:18,034
All my discoveries will be ruined.

485
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:20,550
You'll renew them all.

486
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:24,988
My financial support is unlimited.
- Yes.

487
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:28,118
Long live your dud cheque factory.

488
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,076
Now I shall play with an open hand.

489
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:39,309
Hire a carriage and rush to the police
prefect with this free-mason ring.

490
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,828
Explain the situation.

491
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:52,269
Should I not return within 24 hours
he must send a police corps

492
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,871
to take the castle by storm.

493
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,832
No storming necessary.

494
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,989
The gates will be open.

495
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,829
I understand, Baron.

496
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,350
You put yourself in the hands
of justice.

497
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:14,829
Voluntarily.
You do well.

498
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:25,269
Here Salsa and I dreamt our dream.

499
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:36,548
The ancient legends and
the Professor's experiments

500
01:09:41,239 --> 01:09:46,189
kept the simple natives at
a healthy distance.

501
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:52,788
Then you came to sniff around,
you impertinent gamekeeper!

502
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,275
I gave you warning with
an electric shock.

503
01:09:58,039 --> 01:10:01,510
But you came again,

504
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,948
accompanying this
gentleman

505
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:11,716
- Who set the police at me.

506
01:10:14,279 --> 01:10:17,670
But my dear Tölökö...

507
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:20,632
Teleke!

508
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:24,435
But my dear Tölökö,

509
01:10:25,479 --> 01:10:30,429
when your braves arrive
your betrothed and I shall have flown

510
01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:35,190
and they will be blown up with
the whole of this castle.

511
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,158
No!
- Yes.

512
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,028
And you with them.

513
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,193
Both of you.

514
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:31,596
What have you done?

515
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:34,632
Did you call me, Master?

516
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:42,309
Professor, your experiment...

517
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,037
Absolutely positive with
negative effect.

518
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:52,948
Do you realize what you ve done?

519
01:11:53,399 --> 01:11:54,832
Yes, Master.

520
01:11:55,159 --> 01:11:58,515
The technical revolution is
no garden-party.

521
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:03,231
What can one expect from
a beard-less man.

522
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,118
Much, my Master.

523
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:10,832
Let me show you.

524
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:14,238
A wireless discharge.

525
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:20,189
This here is timed and automatic,
this is manual-immediate.

526
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:23,632
Which is what you need.

527
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,551
Let me demonstrate.

528
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:32,548
Erect the antenna, lift the lock -
just pretending to-fire!

529
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:37,592
Child's play.

530
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:43,037
Meaning even I can manage.

531
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,631
A charming toy.

532
01:12:47,239 --> 01:12:50,630
Thank you, Professor.

533
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,399
Don't mention it.

534
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:59,632
You know too much.

535
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:04,908
But what you don't know is
that I put you into that mental home.

536
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:11,435
Tie him to the charges!

537
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:55,395
Your Lordship!
The door.

538
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,279
Yes, a work of art.

539
01:13:59,239 --> 01:14:04,189
No, I mean a couple of blows and
we re through.

540
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:07,672
Oh, you mean...

541
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,759
Ram it down, that t what I mean.

542
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,592
This would do.

543
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,993
Beethowen as a ram?
No!

544
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,548
He wrote only one opera, at that.

545
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:50,230
This time we'll do it.

546
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:19,195
Bull -

547
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:23,596
- Yes, bullshit.
Oh, shit-dear friend.

548
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:27,555
And your voice?
- My voice?

549
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:32,707
Not that un.
Perfectly all right.

550
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,509
I mean the voice that advises artists.

551
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:39,637
Couldn't it tell us how to get out
of this mess?

552
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:53,750
In spite of this fatal situation
my voice is in top form.

553
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,115
Who orawls through first?

554
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,956
First evacuation stage.

555
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,998
You here?

556
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:40,195
Release the poor man!
The Baron's servant?

557
01:17:40,279 --> 01:17:42,430
But he's a genius.

558
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:47,997
I want my revenge!

559
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:50,719
My nail.
I'll do it.

560
01:17:51,479 --> 01:17:52,958
I'll keep watch.

561
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,279
Thanks.

562
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:26,712
My beloved!

563
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,154
Where did she disappear to?

564
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:52,229
She was here, I saw her.

565
01:19:56,119 --> 01:19:58,235
Show him what he saw.

566
01:19:59,239 --> 01:20:04,189
The Professor caught her eternal image

567
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:09,030
during her last performance.

568
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:14,588
Yes, her picture-that is all you saw.

569
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:17,671
But I heard her voice, too.

570
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,716
That divine voice!

571
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:28,759
I don't understand.
I saw her here,

572
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:30,877
Salsa in flesh and blood.

573
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:33,554
A technical deception too?

574
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:25,990
What does this mean?

575
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:28,157
The doctor was not mistaken.

576
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,911
The primadonna was dead.

577
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,069
But her beauty was preserved.

578
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:38,516
Orphanic embalmed her but her body

579
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:43,708
had to reside in a vacuum.

580
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:48,798
Unfortunately that was destroyed

581
01:21:49,399 --> 01:21:54,349
and with it all that was mortal,
in my adored artist.

582
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,956
I bow to your sentiments.

583
01:21:59,239 --> 01:22:02,868
All she is good for now is to
polish silver with.

584
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,198
You cynical monster!

585
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,235
I care not about transitory matter.

586
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,439
I own more.

587
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:19,828
Her soul, her immortal voice.

588
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:26,393
Clothed in the image of her body,

589
01:22:28,119 --> 01:22:31,078
she lives and I live with her.

590
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:36,472
Baron, you are crazy!

591
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,478
The gentleman bores me.

592
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,269
Do away with him!

593
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,273
Use a civilized method.

594
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:56,592
Your handkerchief.

595
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,716
Don't you have your own?

596
01:23:26,279 --> 01:23:30,068
When I drop it, fire!

597
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,112
That was a fake beard.

598
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,030
He tricked me!

599
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:01,672
Your Lordship!

600
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:08,115
Hand this over to the competent
authorities.

601
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:13,189
What is it?
The documentation to my inventions.

602
01:28:14,399 --> 01:28:19,349
Should it get lost all progress
would be held up for many years.

603
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,752
Away, quickly.

604
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,957
I am definitely dying.

605
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:36,953
Holy smoke and gunpowder!

606
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:40,275
The poor Missy.

607
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:45,833
Au revoir, my dearest.

608
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:51,952
That won't be long, your Lordship!

609
01:28:52,039 --> 01:28:55,430
We'll be blown sky-high

610
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,198
and you'll be right with her.

611
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:05,868
No.
Let's get out of here!

612
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,876
Halt!

613
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:27,275
Forwards, attack!

614
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,238
No!

615
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,279
Your Lordship.

616
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,592
Get back!

617
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,432
The castle'll be blown up!

618
01:31:43,119 --> 01:31:45,189
Au revoir, my treasure.

619
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:37,792
Up the trees!
Jump!

620
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:57,351
DEVIL'S CASTLE WENT TO THE DEVIL

621
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:00,028
All's well that ends well.

622
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:05,748
Orphanic's documentation was studied
at the imperial Patent Office

623
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:09,871
by the competent experts.

624
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,359
And his Lordship?

625
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,637
A fantastic climax to his
artistic career!

626
01:33:34,439 --> 01:33:38,956
Villia also won the happiness he sought.

627
01:34:08,439 --> 01:34:13,389
THE END
