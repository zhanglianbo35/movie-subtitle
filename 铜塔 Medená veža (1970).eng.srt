l wiII teII you a story from Stratena VaIley,

13
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:08,643
which ends at the pIace where the sky begins.

14
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:12,958
Here, we know every rock...

15
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:18,242
And each rock knows our hands.

16
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:22,883
Each spring we returned to our vaIIey

17
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:26,164
as birds after winter.

18
00:03:55,727 --> 00:03:59,356
This is our nest, this is our castIe.

19
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,599
And my friends.

20
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:05,558
Jožo BeIej nicknamed Pirin,

21
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:09,716
and this handsome feIIow, VaIer.

22
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:17,802
- BIess you!
- Go to heII!

23
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:19,966
Thank you!

24
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:27,316
We hated Iofty words.

25
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:34,645
It was enough just knowing this was our home,

26
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:39,719
our roots were in this piece of earth.

27
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:45,478
This was our cradIe, and our grave.

28
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:57,283
We Ieft peopIe with their hardships
down beIow.

29
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:02,036
This was a world of freedom and peace,

30
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:08,278
eagIes were flying around the mountains.
And we were young

31
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:11,677
and Iight Iike angels
who are not scared of faIIing.

32
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:21,159
We were good friends
and we were having a great time.

33
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:34,842
But now I know something we were not
aware of back then.

34
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:42,120
That man can hide from peopIe
but not from oneseIf.

35
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:52,722
Everything was aII right.
We painted the kitchen

36
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:57,722
and VaIer swore every singIe woman
wiII Iike it.

37
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:16,524
A woman! AII aIone.

38
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:19,841
What is she Iike?

39
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:23,558
A bIonde... In a purpIe sweater.

40
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:25,797
And gone crazy underneath.

41
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:29,237
-What about her face?
-Who cares?

42
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:51,320
Go ahead.

43
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:17,321
I won. The bIonde is mine.

44
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:46,203
What is mister doing that for pIease?
Are you aII right? (speaking PoIish)

45
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:50,166
It is aII for the Iady. I just tore this
for the Iady. (speaking PoIish)

46
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:55,085
Thank you very much. Oh, it smeIIs so nice.

47
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:58,285
Very nice meeting you. (speaking PoIish)

48
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:05,084
UnbeIievabIe! That stupid rose aIways works!

49
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:16,726
It´s a Iot of work to Iose aII one has.

50
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:18,160
Hey, VaIer...

51
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:25,484
what´s the difference between you
and a cannibaI coIIecting dried-up skuIIs

52
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:28,718
of his enemies?

53
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:34,801
You guys are just jeaIous!
Women, money, everything!

54
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:39,003
ReaIIy! VaIer is Iucky!

55
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:42,798
He never Iacks money or women.

56
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:48,925
Most peopIe feeI a naturaI urge
to observe the Iaw.

57
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:55,037
But Valer have aIways feIt an urge to break it.

58
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,795
I wish he got caught!

59
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:51,721
Look at how Iate he is again!
What a terribIe person!

60
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:56,918
HonestIy. Wakes aII up and he´s drunk.

61
00:09:57,007 --> 00:10:00,966
Go to sIeep! WhiIe you sIeep, I work.

62
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:06,483
Here, and stop bugging me!

63
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:22,078
Maybe we shouId report him.

64
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:25,563
Right, that wouId settIe the matter.

65
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:30,085
If you betray a friend, your nose wiII rot,

66
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:33,159
your tongue wiII turn bIack,

67
00:10:33,247 --> 00:10:37,957
and your face wiII change into your ass!

68
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,476
The choice is yours!

69
00:10:58,247 --> 00:10:59,885
Wait! Not that one!

70
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,435
- Why? She´s the best one.
- That´s the thing.

71
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:06,044
- Let´s throw.
- I´m not pIaying. They´re Ieaving anyway.

72
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:06,997
Come on!

73
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:17,717
- I won!
- I didn´t see that!

74
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:21,723
-You did, right?
- He was cheating.

75
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,559
- CongratuIations!
- It was on the edge.

76
00:11:23,607 --> 00:11:25,404
Let me throw then...

77
00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:49,399
What a primitive method!
Have you got a serum?

78
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:53,086
They didn´t send us any. Everyone Ieave!

79
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,919
It´s just a snake! It´s Iike a honey-bee!

80
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:03,884
Don´t worry!

81
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:09,845
You too!

82
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:19,964
- Is it going to hurt?
-Just a IittIe.

83
00:12:49,647 --> 00:12:54,562
The treatment had a surprising effect.

84
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:04,241
I was the best man.

85
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:09,527
The second best man
did not make it to church.

86
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:11,677
He was heId up at work.

87
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:02,078
We have to paint it over.

88
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:05,603
- Paint it again?
-Why?

89
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:09,440
What wiII peopIe say?

90
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:12,997
Since when do you care?

91
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:18,362
Those are my footsteps.

92
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:23,680
The way I came, got Iost...

93
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:28,364
- and stayed...
- Do you Iike it, Saska?

94
00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:41,567
If missus likes it,
mister has to Iike it too.

95
00:14:42,607 --> 00:14:43,642
No painting.

96
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:50,515
Since there´s a woman in the house,
I work my butt off.

97
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:54,156
Hes gone mad. He wears pyjamas now too.

98
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:03,763
Look! I put it here for you.

99
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:07,841
Do you Iike it?

100
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:11,758
WeII...

101
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:15,922
It´s a Iot of work to Iose aII one has.

102
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:19,405
I do Iike it.

103
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:23,881
I put aII your young Iadies in here.
They were coIIecting dust.

104
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:34,645
Why don´t you get us some embroidered shirts?

105
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,686
It´s over!

106
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:45,482
We had such a nice Iife here!

107
00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:54,123
A friend is aIways right. Even if he´s wrong.

108
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:58,998
Everything´s going to change. It wiII suck!

109
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:19,238
She won´t Iet me go.

110
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:22,846
She saw a green dog in her dream.

111
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:30,046
She´s worried. She said a green dog
is a bad omen.

112
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:33,119
Let´s go! We´re two too many!

113
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:48,083
Have fun, you green dog!

114
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:41,038
Saska - she was a foreign eIement.

115
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:44,361
A beautifuI germ in Stratena VaIIey,

116
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,156
and in the bIoodstream of our friendship.

117
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:54,280
One person was missing on the rope.

118
00:17:55,647 --> 00:18:00,846
And aII of a sudden we feIt Iike orphans.

119
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:14,676
Are they asIeep?

120
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:15,962
No.

121
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:18,526
Don´t worry...

122
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:57,078
What is it? You´re not sIeeping?

123
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:01,638
I think the wind is tearing at the roof.
We´d better take a Iook.

124
00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:14,045
I don´t get any sIeep since he got married.

125
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:22,081
I can´t faII asIeep if another Iies next to a woman
and its not me.

126
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:25,116
Get married, she´II be there aIl the time.

127
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,400
-You´re here?
- No.

128
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,600
Give me a smoke.

129
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,718
We´II have to come up with something.

130
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:47,839
Yes, but what?

131
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:05,406
WeIcome dear guests!

132
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:08,086
GentIemen!

133
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,041
Come on in!

134
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:21,361
WiII you stop that?!

135
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:31,126
Ladies and gentIemen, Iet me welcome you

136
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:38,045
and thank you for your understanding
and your patience.

137
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:42,721
WeIcome to our new home

138
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:47,164
and Iet me drink to the heaIth
of the hostess.

139
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:59,766
I think the visit is over.

140
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:26,918
Wait! See that?

141
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,126
- Let´s go!
-Why?

142
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:35,323
That´s Saska.

143
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:43,757
So what? She´s stiII aII his.

144
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,320
You pig!

145
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:51,956
A friend´s wife is sacred.

146
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:55,198
It´s Iike a hoIy cow to an Indian.

147
00:21:55,287 --> 00:21:58,962
- I´m no Indian, you idiot!
- Cut it out. Let´s go!

148
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:03,200
If Pirin saw us here,
he´d beat us up,

149
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:06,996
poke our eyes and kick our asses!

150
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:10,796
Hey! You hooIigans! What are you up to?

151
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:14,800
I can see you! Come on out, gigoIIos!

152
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:21,321
Come cIoser! Don´t be shy!

153
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:24,843
Hand me my cIothes.

154
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:40,435
And cIose your eyes, pIease. Both of you!

155
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:52,404
Put it on the rock,

156
00:22:54,727 --> 00:22:57,799
and turn around. Both of you!

157
00:23:00,407 --> 00:23:02,875
Don´t you dare peeking.

158
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:07,479
-Where´s Pirin?
- He´s on a date. I gave him a day off.

159
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:22,278
PIease sit. I´II serve on you.

160
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:32,681
Interesting! What an originaI idea.

161
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:49,116
Hey, Saska?

162
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:56,524
- Don´t teII Pirin...
- Don´t teII what?

163
00:23:56,727 --> 00:24:00,686
Don´t telI him we spied on you.

164
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:06,644
AII men are the same, they Iike to watch!

165
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:20,767
Perhaps this was the moment
we realIy accepted her

166
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:23,804
Iike our own sister.

167
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:35,800
We started teaching her new things,

168
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:38,685
when peopIe hang on the same rope

169
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:42,555
with the other´s Iife in their hands.

170
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:54,399
You must have three stabIe points:
Two feet and a hand, or the other way around.

171
00:24:54,447 --> 00:24:58,679
- Three stabIe points is the ruIe.
- One is enough for me.

172
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:08,121
I wonder who gave the names
to these hiIIs.

173
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:13,881
Like that one... Frog Horse!

174
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:20,555
-Why?
- They must have named it after you.

175
00:25:26,687 --> 00:25:29,599
What a view!

176
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:34,841
How can I heIp you?

177
00:25:34,927 --> 00:25:38,078
Two cognacs. The best you´ve got.

178
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:48,683
- Here you are.
- One´s for you, madam!

179
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:51,804
I don´t drink, sorry.

180
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,437
Our coIIeague doesn´t drink on duty.

181
00:25:57,327 --> 00:26:02,196
Thanks. Cheers!

182
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:09,880
Saska was not to bIame
that there were other men.

183
00:26:10,727 --> 00:26:13,799
They were aII over her.

184
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:17,037
So what if the guests Iike her?

185
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,676
It´s good for the business.

186
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:23,680
To heII with that! My wife is not some...

187
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:26,319
I just can´t stand it.

188
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:28,438
What is it you can´t stand?

189
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:34,521
You smiIe and Iisten to that stupid taIk.

190
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:37,963
Do you Iike it?
You´re a married woman!

191
00:26:38,047 --> 00:26:42,643
- ShouId I stop taIking to peopIe?
- Not to peopIe, to men.

192
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:44,797
What do you want from me? I´m not dumb!

193
00:26:44,847 --> 00:26:48,442
Do as you pIease! It´s up to you.

194
00:26:52,927 --> 00:26:57,000
AII right. I think you´II be happy.

195
00:26:58,407 --> 00:27:00,602
Where´s the soup pIease?

196
00:27:01,807 --> 00:27:02,637
WiIl be right there.

197
00:27:04,647 --> 00:27:10,085
Oh and do you know what shouId
the weather be Iike today?

198
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:21,120
Oh, thanks. I understand.

199
00:27:21,327 --> 00:27:26,162
PartIy cloudy. Thanks a Iot.

200
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:32,155
Did you see? So pretty and such a tragedy.

201
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:33,879
Excuse me... PIease.

202
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:37,962
-Was she born Iike that?
- She was born out of wedIock.

203
00:27:38,527 --> 00:27:41,837
An unknown tourist Ieft her in the hiIIs.

204
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:46,081
- The child was raised by a mother bear...
- TerribIe!

205
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:50,285
She never Iearned to speak.
- Just Iike Tarzan.

206
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:50,924
Enjoy your meaI.

207
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:55,603
A she-bear? What a great story!

208
00:27:55,687 --> 00:28:00,886
But out of wedIock is too much.

209
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:07,042
- Why? It adds some thriII.
- Besides, it´s true.

210
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:11,396
- What´s true?
- That my parents were not married.

211
00:28:17,527 --> 00:28:20,758
- Why haven´t you toId me?
- What?

212
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:24,357
That you don´t know your father.

213
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:30,317
l forgot. It´s not that important is it?

214
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:37,040
It isn´t but I want to know everything about you.

215
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:41,757
You´re a man
and men never need to know much.

216
00:28:46,527 --> 00:28:49,997
- I don´t like this.
-What?

217
00:28:53,287 --> 00:28:55,596
Like pretending she´s dumb.

218
00:28:56,607 --> 00:28:58,837
lt´s crueI.

219
00:29:03,527 --> 00:29:08,237
Pirin is right about that one.

220
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:12,597
You can´t give a woman too much
freedom or you´II turn her into a sIut.

221
00:29:12,687 --> 00:29:15,076
Enough of that. Go to sIeep!

222
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:21,324
Maybe I´m wrong but I have a feeling

223
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:26,964
that Pirin is not doing justice
to this big Iove of his.

224
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:30,604
Big Iove!

225
00:29:32,527 --> 00:29:35,599
Should I envy or pity him?

226
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:55,283
Since their wedding, Saska has not gone
down to town once.

227
00:29:55,847 --> 00:29:58,839
She´s spent aII summer in the vaIIey.

228
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:07,115
With caIm autumn days
she started going on mysterious trips.

229
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:14,760
HAVING MY HAIR DONE

230
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:29,365
What do you think?

231
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:41,435
You don´t Iook Iike you.

232
00:31:25,847 --> 00:31:26,643
Where have you been?

233
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:32,238
I was craving sweets.

234
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:36,161
Seven hours up and down for three oranges?

235
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:38,807
I´ve eaten two on the way. Catch!

236
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:50,555
CouId you say thank you?

237
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:56,323
I think she´s seeing someone down there.

238
00:33:00,487 --> 00:33:02,000
What do you think?

239
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:05,005
What shouId we say?

240
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:09,038
You´re the one sleeping with her.

241
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:17,240
I don´t feeI sure about anything anymore...

242
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:21,325
What shouId I do?

243
00:33:24,047 --> 00:33:26,561
Nothing. Give it some time.

244
00:33:27,647 --> 00:33:29,956
If she´s cheating on you, you´II find out.

245
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:32,364
And go on from there.

246
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:42,206
There isn´t anyone Iike her.
Anyone eIse.

247
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:51,480
Soon we go back to town.
You´II spend winter together.

248
00:33:52,607 --> 00:33:54,882
Everything is going to be alI right.

249
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:56,559
- Do you think so?
- Sure

250
00:33:56,647 --> 00:33:58,877
Why wouId she be cheating?
Three months after the wedding?

251
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:01,765
WeIl... I´ve heard stories...

252
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,643
She´s young... She gets bored.

253
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:10,717
Give her a bunch of kids.
That´II keep her occupied.

254
00:34:10,807 --> 00:34:12,798
She said she won´t Ieave again.

255
00:34:16,927 --> 00:34:19,395
But I don´t trust her anymore.

256
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:30,605
GentIemen, cream of mushroom today.
What do you say?

257
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:36,478
What wiII the excuse be tomorrow?

258
00:34:36,687 --> 00:34:39,520
- What excuse?
- What is it going to say tomorrow?

259
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:44,443
And the day after? What wiII you crave then?

260
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,366
Not sure yet.

261
00:34:55,887 --> 00:35:00,165
You don´t beIieve me. Why don´t you tie me up?

262
00:35:00,847 --> 00:35:03,759
I pIayed dumb before,
I can pIay a dog on a leash too.

263
00:35:08,687 --> 00:35:10,325
That´s not what I meant.

264
00:35:12,407 --> 00:35:14,875
Why do you never teII me you´re going out?

265
00:35:16,087 --> 00:35:18,043
I aIways Ieave a message.

266
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:20,318
And l aIways come back.

267
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:33,843
If you want to spy on me,
maybe one day I won´t come back.

268
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:57,445
Pirin didn´t see it was futiIe.

269
00:35:59,007 --> 00:36:01,567
Saska is a butterfIy- and he caught it.

270
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:08,042
But he cannot cIose her
in his hands.

271
00:36:28,807 --> 00:36:32,925
He´s picking up the money.
Our Iast pay checks.

272
00:36:33,807 --> 00:36:36,765
Too bad. I couId stay the winter...

273
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:40,243
I couIdn´t. It´s too coId.

274
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:44,480
And you Ieave footsteps.
Any officer wiII catch you in no time.

275
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:48,963
Hey Iazy bones! Have you heard?

276
00:36:49,047 --> 00:36:51,800
- What´s the news?
- We´re throwing a party tonight.

277
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:55,960
- What party?
- AfareweII party.

278
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,357
And try to shave. I onIy dance
with gentIemen.

279
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:21,201
Does he know about the party?

280
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:24,199
It´s a surprise.
He must have gotten heId up.

281
00:37:44,487 --> 00:37:45,636
Madam...

282
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,961
Excuse me.

283
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:56,040
ShaII we dance?

284
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:10,444
You Iook beautifuI, Saska!

285
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:15,557
I haven´t danced since my wedding.

286
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,205
This is something!

287
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:55,925
- What the heII are you doing?
- Don´t disturb pIease. There´s a party here.

288
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:04,757
On invitation onIy. ShaII we invite him?

289
00:39:04,807 --> 00:39:05,876
Who is it?

290
00:39:08,887 --> 00:39:10,400
The mister you´re sIeeping with.

291
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:16,123
No, that´s not my husband.

292
00:39:17,327 --> 00:39:20,125
My husband greets everyone,

293
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:24,200
and kisses the Iadies´ hands.

294
00:39:59,287 --> 00:40:02,882
- What´s up with him?
- He´s mad we started without him.

295
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,002
PIease!

296
00:40:05,527 --> 00:40:06,960
My oId song!

297
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:12,680
ShaII we dance?

298
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,524
You go dance with your doctor!

299
00:40:20,047 --> 00:40:21,407
With who?

300
00:40:21,407 --> 00:40:24,604
You don´t know any doctors right?

301
00:40:25,247 --> 00:40:27,761
I know about a thousand doctors.
Which one do you have in mind?

302
00:40:27,847 --> 00:40:32,079
The one you´ve taken for your Iover!

303
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:36,205
What´s wrong with you? Are you drunk?

304
00:40:37,647 --> 00:40:39,239
Stay!

305
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:42,679
I want my friends to see what my wife is Iike.

306
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:49,442
You don´t know your wife yourseIf!

307
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:54,558
How Iong has this been going on?

308
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,840
Speak!

309
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:06,047
I want to know everything.
Where did you meet?

310
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:06,877
How often?

311
00:41:09,047 --> 00:41:12,722
Have you Iost your tongue?

312
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:17,845
- Don´t, Saska! Stop!
- He taught me...

313
00:41:17,927 --> 00:41:20,999
If you cheated on me, I´lI...

314
00:41:23,527 --> 00:41:25,324
KiII me?

315
00:41:28,607 --> 00:41:32,202
If you don´t trust me, go ahead.

316
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:33,962
KiII me.

317
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:39,286
Knock three times when you come to apoIogize.

318
00:41:47,687 --> 00:41:53,159
Maybe I´II forgive you because I know
how much you Iove me.

319
00:41:56,127 --> 00:41:57,685
Good night.

320
00:42:23,727 --> 00:42:25,797
I don´t get it.

321
00:42:28,927 --> 00:42:34,126
If she Iied, she wouId not be so bold,
so sure...

322
00:42:38,127 --> 00:42:39,606
They saw her.

323
00:42:42,087 --> 00:42:43,964
She meets him at the hospitaI.

324
00:42:44,047 --> 00:42:48,199
Let it be now, get some sIeep.

325
00:42:51,807 --> 00:42:54,162
I can´t think of anything eIse.

326
00:42:57,047 --> 00:43:00,835
How shouId we act around her?

327
00:43:03,127 --> 00:43:09,646
If you´re my friends, treat her as a whore!

328
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:25,403
l don´t understand. They´re like gypsies...

329
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:28,799
First they nearIy kiII each other,
then they make up, they go to bed,

330
00:43:28,887 --> 00:43:32,516
and go out together in the morning.

331
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:36,722
That´s true Iove... maybe.

332
00:43:37,527 --> 00:43:41,202
That´s not Iove, that´s marriage!

333
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:44,916
Love is the thing before.
Then it´s just a pain in the neck.

334
00:43:49,847 --> 00:43:53,760
That waII is too difficuIt for her.

335
00:43:53,847 --> 00:43:58,477
Not with Pirin. He promised
to take her to Copper Iong ago.

336
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:19,281
Come back! Something happened at the waII!

337
00:44:27,607 --> 00:44:30,599
I can´t see Saska! Go get some heIp!

338
00:44:30,687 --> 00:44:32,996
And bring bandages, and the rope... everything!

339
00:44:37,767 --> 00:44:40,565
Copper Tower! Pirin and his wife!

340
00:44:40,647 --> 00:44:46,597
- Move it, boys! Over!
- I read you. Over!

341
00:44:50,447 --> 00:44:52,961
That´s terribIe. Look!

342
00:44:58,927 --> 00:45:02,158
Christ! She feII from the walI.

343
00:45:51,847 --> 00:45:54,680
What is it? Can´t you knock?

344
00:45:54,927 --> 00:45:57,361
I want to know what happened between you
and my wife.

345
00:46:07,047 --> 00:46:09,197
Who are you? What wife?

346
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:11,926
You must see a lot of women!

347
00:46:14,127 --> 00:46:16,197
Who do you think you are?

348
00:46:17,487 --> 00:46:21,685
I´m on caII. I don´t have time
for private matters now.

349
00:46:23,167 --> 00:46:27,319
Did you hear? The doctor is too busy

350
00:46:27,407 --> 00:46:29,477
to see us.

351
00:46:30,647 --> 00:46:34,083
But you weren´t busy to see Saska?!

352
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:37,805
So it´s you!

353
00:46:37,887 --> 00:46:41,357
Yes, it´s me.

354
00:46:49,447 --> 00:46:50,800
l had the feeIing...

355
00:46:54,207 --> 00:47:00,601
... she´d have a husband Iike that,
a guy who thinks he can soIve everything.

356
00:47:00,687 --> 00:47:03,679
And brings his friends aIong for support...

357
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:07,438
You know what?
She was supposed to be my wife.

358
00:47:07,527 --> 00:47:10,439
You messed up her Iife,
she canceIIed our engagement for you.

359
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:15,601
And you keep her in your rathoIe
Iike your servant.

360
00:47:15,687 --> 00:47:18,076
You stoIe her from me
and you´Il give her back to me!

361
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:14,640
Those two were fighting for a dead woman.

362
00:48:15,887 --> 00:48:18,526
The Copper Tower kept its victim.

363
00:48:19,607 --> 00:48:23,520
The hiIIs refused to Iet our friend
bury her with due respect.

364
00:48:25,047 --> 00:48:26,958
Everything got covered in snow.

365
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:33,955
Saska was never found and she´II never return.

366
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:05,522
It was time,

367
00:49:06,247 --> 00:49:10,240
and we returned to our vaIIey
as migrating birds.

368
00:49:12,807 --> 00:49:15,765
And we were Ioaded with a burden.

369
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:22,919
Pirin was sentenced to 14,
VaIér and me to 10 months

370
00:49:23,007 --> 00:49:29,196
for physicaI harm.
On probation, IuckiIy.

371
00:49:49,127 --> 00:49:50,685
May I?

372
00:49:59,327 --> 00:50:02,399
Are you nuts? You threw 500 crowns away.

373
00:50:02,847 --> 00:50:04,326
I´II pay it back.

374
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:11,924
To heII with your money.
I want my radio.

375
00:50:18,847 --> 00:50:22,999
That was Saska´s song.

376
00:51:25,327 --> 00:51:26,840
As for the radio....

377
00:51:29,607 --> 00:51:33,680
I´m sorry. I´Il buy you a new one.

378
00:51:34,607 --> 00:51:39,397
And one more thing. SmuggIing is over.

379
00:51:43,647 --> 00:51:44,523
Why?

380
00:51:45,447 --> 00:51:48,678
We´re on probation for three years,
remember?

381
00:51:48,767 --> 00:51:51,440
If they catch you, we aII go with you.

382
00:51:53,967 --> 00:51:55,844
ShaII I wait three years?

383
00:51:57,167 --> 00:51:59,965
How can we pay for the doctor´s office?

384
00:52:00,047 --> 00:52:02,800
And damages to the doctor?

385
00:52:05,367 --> 00:52:08,404
How?

386
00:52:08,487 --> 00:52:09,886
Stop it.

387
00:52:15,527 --> 00:52:19,805
TilI I find my wife and bury her properIy.

388
00:53:52,887 --> 00:53:56,323
They´re up aIready. Fine chaps.

389
00:53:56,887 --> 00:54:01,756
I´ve known them since we were kids.
l Iove to watch them cIimb.

390
00:54:21,647 --> 00:54:24,366
I wonder if they got permission
for the cross.

391
00:54:24,447 --> 00:54:27,245
That´s none of our business.

392
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:32,841
They´re nice guys,
but they´II pay for VaIer sooner or Iater.

393
00:55:09,527 --> 00:55:12,678
And the sad job began.

394
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:15,638
Pirin was Iooking for his woman.

395
00:55:16,007 --> 00:55:19,716
He wanted to force the mountains
to give what was Ieft of her.

396
00:55:20,927 --> 00:55:24,602
He suffered quietIy.

397
00:55:27,047 --> 00:55:32,041
I was gIad when he sent me to town
to buy a new radio for VaIer.

398
00:55:32,847 --> 00:55:34,041
One more!

399
00:55:37,927 --> 00:55:42,398
l heard you put up a cross.

400
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:46,916
Right.

401
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:53,642
First he kiIIs, then he mourns!

402
00:55:55,807 --> 00:55:58,116
Do you think that Pirin...

403
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:01,885
Do you want to get beaten up?!

404
00:56:02,407 --> 00:56:07,197
Me? PeopIe taIk.

405
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:11,598
I just Iisten.

406
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,041
Can you read, Scabby?

407
00:56:17,647 --> 00:56:21,083
There was a report written up
on the accident.

408
00:56:21,527 --> 00:56:23,563
Pirin had bad Iuck, that´s aII.

409
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:25,877
Reports... papers!

410
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:29,323
The paper says one thing,
the rock saw another thing.

411
00:56:29,407 --> 00:56:32,080
You weren´t there!

412
00:56:36,767 --> 00:56:39,759
Pirin couId never do such a thing.

413
00:56:39,847 --> 00:56:42,441
How do you know what one is capabIe of?

414
00:57:00,607 --> 00:57:04,395
Scabby! You son of a deviI!

415
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:07,877
We spent alI Pirin´s money on drinks.

416
00:57:09,207 --> 00:57:12,597
It wasn´t your money, what´s the harm?

417
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:17,276
l have to buy a radio!

418
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,000
Don´t worry.

419
00:57:25,047 --> 00:57:27,242
Scabby can heIp you.

420
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:15,879
-What´s this?
- The radio.

421
00:58:17,807 --> 00:58:20,640
Are you drunk?

422
00:58:22,247 --> 00:58:23,805
Where did you get it?

423
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:26,124
I´m not sure...

424
00:58:26,247 --> 00:58:28,522
You shouIdn´t have sent me to town.

425
00:58:29,647 --> 00:58:32,036
I´II burn it, or I´Il chop it up for firewood

426
00:58:32,087 --> 00:58:34,157
together with the scabby fooI!

427
00:58:47,247 --> 00:58:48,805
It works.

428
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:53,886
Sure it does. I don´t buy junk.

429
00:58:55,727 --> 00:58:58,446
Too bad we can´t take it up to the hut.

430
00:58:59,527 --> 00:59:01,643
Who says?

431
00:59:05,447 --> 00:59:08,917
You´II sweat the boose out of your system.

432
00:59:39,607 --> 00:59:45,239
Hey, what the heII do we need this for?

433
00:59:45,287 --> 00:59:50,042
What the heII did you buy it for?
Shut up and keep going!

434
01:00:14,767 --> 01:00:17,156
I´Il remember that hike as Iong as I Iive.

435
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:19,887
l was swearing every step I took.

436
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:22,082
I cursed Scabby and myseIf.

437
01:00:23,127 --> 01:00:28,207
I cursed Scabby and myseIf.
Why did I agree to go see

438
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:31,517
the church and have mass wine too?

439
01:00:46,247 --> 01:00:50,638
To heII with it! You carry the thing!

440
01:00:55,647 --> 01:00:57,524
The moon is bright,

441
01:00:59,647 --> 01:01:01,365
we can waIk at night too.

442
01:01:02,607 --> 01:01:03,926
No way.

443
01:01:05,247 --> 01:01:08,683
Just push a IittIe, press down,

444
01:01:09,487 --> 01:01:14,356
a second is enough and the burden is gone.

445
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:20,846
Who knows, maybe Pirin
did the same thing on Copper Tower.

446
01:01:22,087 --> 01:01:23,725
Move your foot.

447
01:01:25,327 --> 01:01:27,636
Get up! Let´s go!

448
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:51,161
Are you guys nuts?!

449
01:01:54,247 --> 01:01:57,364
It´s yours.

450
01:01:59,807 --> 01:02:02,446
We brought this for you.

451
01:02:02,527 --> 01:02:06,042
- You threw away a radio, not a...
- AII right, aII right...

452
01:02:09,327 --> 01:02:11,283
I won´t throw this away.

453
01:02:17,527 --> 01:02:19,802
Anyone can have a radio.

454
01:02:22,087 --> 01:02:26,763
You wiII have a harmonium.

455
01:02:51,007 --> 01:02:52,884
We used to have one at home.

456
01:02:54,767 --> 01:02:59,045
Mom soId it when my father Ieft us.

457
01:03:12,647 --> 01:03:14,000
What was that?

458
01:03:14,087 --> 01:03:16,726
It sounded Iike shooting at the border.

459
01:03:32,647 --> 01:03:34,603
It was a sad job.

460
01:03:36,887 --> 01:03:39,765
I´m not sure it was necessary.

461
01:03:40,887 --> 01:03:46,962
Maybe it´s better to remember peopIe
the way they were.

462
01:03:51,047 --> 01:03:54,483
But Pirin wiII never find peace
before finding his wife.

463
01:04:17,327 --> 01:04:18,203
Look!

464
01:04:19,287 --> 01:04:20,481
What is it?

465
01:04:22,367 --> 01:04:23,720
Blood.

466
01:04:27,087 --> 01:04:28,315
What happened?

467
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,482
I knew you´d freak out.

468
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:34,558
Nothing happened.

469
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:37,806
Everything´s aII right.
Those dummies don´t know how to shoot.

470
01:04:42,367 --> 01:04:44,005
I toId you to stop.

471
01:04:44,087 --> 01:04:47,796
Be quiet. Go wipe the bIood
from the stairs.

472
01:04:48,047 --> 01:04:49,719
To heII with this!

473
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:53,396
- Can you waIk?
- Sure I can!

474
01:04:54,407 --> 01:05:02,564
Lord, such bad Iuck!
For two pairs of stupid shoes!

475
01:05:03,807 --> 01:05:06,480
- Who was shooting? Our guys?
- No, it was the PoIish!

476
01:05:06,567 --> 01:05:09,479
And I swear I was on our side by then!

477
01:05:09,967 --> 01:05:12,367
How can some stupid foreigners

478
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:14,358
shoot SIovaks Iike rabbits!

479
01:05:14,407 --> 01:05:16,204
Shut up and Iie down!

480
01:05:28,367 --> 01:05:29,880
What do you need this for?

481
01:05:32,447 --> 01:05:34,915
I need it to study and Iearn right?

482
01:05:35,007 --> 01:05:38,920
- And the shoes?
- Ijust took them aIong.

483
01:05:39,767 --> 01:05:41,997
You can´t Iive on music.

484
01:06:07,847 --> 01:06:08,802
Where are they?

485
01:06:15,967 --> 01:06:17,923
- HeIIo boys!
- Hi, Feri.

486
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:21,079
- Hi, VaIer.
- Hi, officer.

487
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:26,116
What a renaissance taIent you are.

488
01:06:33,567 --> 01:06:38,357
Where have you been today, guys?

489
01:06:38,447 --> 01:06:41,678
As usuaI. Under the Copper.

490
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:43,883
We were searching aII day.

491
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:48,324
- AlI three of you?
- Sure.

492
01:06:49,247 --> 01:06:53,126
-Who Iooked after the hut?
- Nobody. We took a day off!

493
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:54,998
ShaII we do a search?

494
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,560
Have you got a warrant?

495
01:06:59,647 --> 01:07:02,115
I can do it without a warrant if I want to.

496
01:07:02,167 --> 01:07:03,646
I know.

497
01:07:06,607 --> 01:07:07,756
Six.

498
01:07:22,887 --> 01:07:24,605
WeII! A PoIish score!

499
01:07:25,927 --> 01:07:28,395
When was the Iast time you´ve been there?

500
01:07:31,487 --> 01:07:33,557
Some fifteen years ago.

501
01:07:34,687 --> 01:07:36,643
It was a schooI trip you see.

502
01:07:36,727 --> 01:07:41,403
The teacher heId my hand,
so I would not be scared of the PoIes.

503
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,443
And you haven´t visited there today?

504
01:07:47,447 --> 01:07:53,158
What for?
Grass is greener on this side of the fence.

505
01:07:53,207 --> 01:07:56,483
Very funny! You´II stop joking soon enough.

506
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:00,957
AII of you, comrades.
You too.

507
01:08:01,047 --> 01:08:05,245
Have you got permission for the cross?

508
01:08:05,927 --> 01:08:10,125
TeII him to shut up! If he mentions
the cross again, I´II...

509
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:13,000
There´s nothing wrong about the cross.

510
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,516
Let it be. Everything´s fine.

511
01:08:17,487 --> 01:08:20,447
Just that this morning the Polish
wounded a man

512
01:08:20,447 --> 01:08:22,802
who then crossed the border to here.

513
01:08:23,847 --> 01:08:25,565
-WouId you know anything about it?
- No.

514
01:08:25,607 --> 01:08:29,839
That´s what I thought, as usuaI.

515
01:08:30,967 --> 01:08:36,803
WeIl then. Good night, boys.
And see you Iater, VaIer.

516
01:08:36,847 --> 01:08:39,202
- Your majesty!
- You fooI!

517
01:08:45,447 --> 01:08:47,085
He needs to catch someone.

518
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:50,045
He wants a promotion...

519
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:52,839
Good for him.

520
01:09:01,207 --> 01:09:04,279
Pirin searched aIone today since dawn.

521
01:09:05,807 --> 01:09:08,367
I stayed to take care of VaIer.

522
01:09:09,767 --> 01:09:12,235
SuddenIy an unexpected guest turned up.

523
01:09:29,527 --> 01:09:32,917
- What does he want?
- He´s waiting for Pirin.

524
01:09:33,927 --> 01:09:37,158
-Why?
- It´s none of your business!

525
01:09:42,607 --> 01:09:43,881
You haven´t got enough?

526
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:48,039
If he sees you here, you´II end up
in hospitaI, and we go to prison.

527
01:09:58,207 --> 01:10:01,995
Let bygones be bygones.

528
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:07,523
Here you are. Have a drink and go.

529
01:10:07,567 --> 01:10:10,365
Come on!
SIap him so he´d buzz off!

530
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,437
I´m staying here and I´m going to talk to him.

531
01:10:13,487 --> 01:10:17,241
What about, damn it? The woman is dead!

532
01:10:18,087 --> 01:10:22,000
- Let the dead rest in peace!
- The dead, yes, not the Iiving.

533
01:10:24,127 --> 01:10:26,800
You aImost crippIed me. And what for?

534
01:10:26,887 --> 01:10:28,843
There was nothing between me and his wife.

535
01:10:28,927 --> 01:10:32,806
What do you mean? You were seeing each other,
she went to meet you!

536
01:10:34,207 --> 01:10:37,836
I wanted her to get a divorce,
and come back to me.

537
01:10:38,687 --> 01:10:42,077
-What about her?
- She asked me to let her go.

538
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:44,362
She said she´d never Ieave him.

539
01:10:45,567 --> 01:10:49,355
She asked me to forgive and forget.

540
01:10:49,447 --> 01:10:51,881
And to Iet her Iive her Iife.

541
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:09,484
That´s aII right. I knew it!

542
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:13,606
Nothing´s aII right!
Have you heard the rumours?

543
01:11:14,567 --> 01:11:16,000
Do you beIieve it?

544
01:11:17,847 --> 01:11:22,557
It was an ordinary accident at Copper Tower.
Understand?

545
01:11:24,407 --> 01:11:28,116
It was an ordinary murder.
l know he kiIIed her because of me.

546
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:32,001
I don´t want to see the Iook in his eyes
when I teII him he kiIIed for no reason.

547
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:35,159
- Is this what you came here for?
- Yes.

548
01:11:35,247 --> 01:11:38,637
I´Il teII him so he can go on with a happy Iife.

549
01:11:43,447 --> 01:11:47,725
You wiII never teIl him about this, doc.

550
01:11:50,567 --> 01:11:53,161
You got one minute to get up and Ieave.

551
01:12:58,967 --> 01:13:03,245
I know where to find her now.

552
01:13:05,087 --> 01:13:10,081
That was the worst part,
knowing she may stiII be aIive.

553
01:13:12,247 --> 01:13:14,886
There was an accident and your wife is dead.

554
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:21,564
It was not an accident.

555
01:13:23,007 --> 01:13:25,157
I kiIIed her and you know it.

556
01:13:27,527 --> 01:13:31,884
I didn´t trust her, I feIt I wouId kiII her.

557
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:37,201
I resisted, by it was in my bIood.

558
01:13:39,687 --> 01:13:45,717
She feII off the walI
and I could not save her.

559
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:50,437
The rope burned my hands,
but I heId on.

560
01:13:52,527 --> 01:13:57,317
Then it jerked... and it was over.

561
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:01,086
The rope reaIIy broke?

562
01:14:01,127 --> 01:14:04,005
WeIl yes. Otherwise she wouIdn´t have faIIen.

563
01:14:05,047 --> 01:14:07,880
Then you didn´t do it!

564
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:11,565
You did not kiII her, man!

565
01:14:12,487 --> 01:14:16,036
My thoughts kiIIed her.
AIl that was inside of me.

566
01:14:16,767 --> 01:14:20,203
Have you gone mad?

567
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:24,967
Maybe it was there inside of you
but you didn´t kiII her!

568
01:14:24,967 --> 01:14:25,877
Do you hear me?

569
01:14:28,087 --> 01:14:30,442
Accidents happen aIl the time.

570
01:14:30,687 --> 01:14:35,556
You don´t know.
Maybe she was better off, faIIing Iike that.

571
01:14:36,487 --> 01:14:38,557
Maybe I reaIIy wouId have kiIIed her one day.

572
01:14:39,927 --> 01:14:41,724
You had no reason!

573
01:14:44,087 --> 01:14:48,046
She never cheated on you. Never.

574
01:14:51,407 --> 01:14:52,760
How do you know?

575
01:14:54,247 --> 01:14:55,566
I just do.

576
01:14:56,847 --> 01:15:04,117
The other guy was here today
and he toId us the truth.

577
01:15:06,047 --> 01:15:08,880
he was a good wife
and she Ioved no one eIse but you.

578
01:15:33,927 --> 01:15:35,246
Are you nuts?

579
01:15:37,487 --> 01:15:40,320
Sick peopIe need fresh air.

580
01:15:40,407 --> 01:15:42,716
And musicians need a good echo.

581
01:15:46,847 --> 01:15:48,963
See? This is a reaI echo. Understand?

582
01:15:49,287 --> 01:15:51,676
If Pirin were here, he wouIdn´t Iet you.

583
01:15:51,807 --> 01:15:54,002
Why didn´t you go with him?
I´d get some peace and quiet.

584
01:15:54,047 --> 01:15:55,605
He didn´t wake me up.

585
01:15:57,847 --> 01:16:01,681
He may find Saska today.
And he wants to do it aIone.

586
01:16:02,287 --> 01:16:06,565
- And I need to take care of you.
- My words. Do it.

587
01:16:07,087 --> 01:16:08,839
EngIish breakfast pIease.

588
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:12,362
Wounded peopIe need caIories.

589
01:16:12,447 --> 01:16:15,041
Do you want me to scratch your butt too?

590
01:16:15,887 --> 01:16:17,559
Maybe Iater.

591
01:16:56,007 --> 01:16:56,962
VaIer!

592
01:16:59,647 --> 01:17:01,126
Pirin...

593
01:17:02,407 --> 01:17:04,602
He went to kiII himseIf.

594
01:17:12,367 --> 01:17:15,996
Good-bye, my boys. We won´t meet again.

595
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:23,760
When you find my wife,
bury us side by side.

596
01:17:25,647 --> 01:17:31,722
Your good friend, Jozo BeIej.

597
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:38,317
No! I won´t Iet him! It won´t happen!

598
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:41,239
Do something!

599
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:23,036
I won´t Iet him!

600
01:18:23,807 --> 01:18:25,240
Pirin!

601
01:18:28,487 --> 01:18:30,603
Don´t do it! You can´t!

602
01:18:30,727 --> 01:18:32,046
He´s stiII aIive.

603
01:18:33,047 --> 01:18:36,517
Shut up! Every minute is precious.
FIy Iow above him.

604
01:18:36,607 --> 01:18:42,523
Come back, Pirin!

605
01:18:43,727 --> 01:18:45,877
Buddy!

606
01:19:03,087 --> 01:19:06,875
Pirin, I won´t Iet you!

607
01:19:52,847 --> 01:19:55,520
Not Iike that! Not with dogs!

608
01:20:06,887 --> 01:20:09,640
No dogs! I can´t stand that.

609
01:20:10,247 --> 01:20:13,319
There´s no point, don´t be siIIy.

610
01:20:14,087 --> 01:20:15,998
VaIer, we´ve got evidence.

611
01:20:21,407 --> 01:20:24,524
Come then, but onIy you.

612
01:20:55,847 --> 01:20:59,601
Pirin has found what we are aII Iooking for.

613
01:21:00,447 --> 01:21:06,238
Peace for our souIs,
justice for our deeds,

614
01:21:07,127 --> 01:21:11,245
here, on this beautifuI and sad piece of Iand,

615
01:21:11,327 --> 01:21:17,038
which is our cradIe and our grave.
