13
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,001
Janko, Hanko, find me!

14
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,524
Go!

15
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,451
Attention!

16
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,366
Forward march!

17
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,530
- Can you read?
- Yes, I can.

18
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,523
Come along!

19
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,082
FIGHT FOR FREEDOM!

20
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,563
What's the news again?

21
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,211
Read it!

22
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,526
- Good morning.
- Good morning Mr. Teacher.

23
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,484
Who started the war?
The Germans.

24
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,124
Who makes you a beggar?
The Germans.

25
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,162
Who's your enemy?
The Germans.

26
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,409
Impudence!

27
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,608
Who posted it up here?
Who saw him?

28
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,565
Me.

29
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,122
Fools. You're driving the whole
village to disaster.

30
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,168
I won't protect you from the Germans.

31
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,208
Who would you be able to protect!

32
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,045
He's right!
They shouldn't do things like that.

33
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,727
Dad, come home quickly,
Samko was beaten up by Germans.

34
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,211
What?

35
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,569
Partisans are behind the village!

36
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,841
DEATH TO FASCISM!

37
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,206
Down!

38
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,810
You have to leave this region
by tomorrow.

39
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,327
You didn't bring anything,
You won't take away anything.

40
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,811
I don't understand.

41
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,726
It's nothing.
Someday you'll understand.

42
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,883
I'm here. Ondrej!

43
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,926
Bless you mom.
I'm hungry as a wolf.

44
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,083
Just a moment.
I was writing to Matus.

45
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,722
Put it away. The food is right here.

46
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,928
Stem!

47
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,402
Where are you going?
Show me some ID!

48
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,723
Yes, I'm...

49
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,927
Let's have a look! Matus Svrcina.

50
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,401
How was it in Germany?

51
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,407
So.

52
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,682
And what now?

53
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,445
I go home.

54
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,605
I couldn't stand it any longer.

55
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,605
And a permission from the German
authorities?

56
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,526
Ok. I've already seen it.

57
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,571
Well, go! We'll see each other later.

58
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,610
Good night.

59
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,323
Good guy-

60
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,802
Just a bit miserable.

61
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,608
Don't go home, wait for me
at the chapel.

62
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,247
You cannot stay here.

63
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,483
Partisans chased Hitlerjugend
out of the district yesterday.

64
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,608
The Germans are furious.

65
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,966
Moreover, your age group is the next
to join the army.

66
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,010
I doubt you want to
fight for Germans.

67
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,560
No, indeed, I do not.

68
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,571
What shall I do then?

69
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,803
Your brother is a lumberjack
in Pusta Valley.

70
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,043
Hide there.

71
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,370
Yeah.

72
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,767
I just want to see my home.

73
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,084
Take a quick look and then off
to the mountains.

74
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,324
It won't disappoint you.

75
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,285
Our teacher has also something
to do with partisans.

76
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,409
It is said, this artful tinker visits
him very often.

77
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,646
Mr. Teacher is clever,
he won't do anything stupid...

78
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,769
And the tinker Joiko?

79
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,481
Why should such a goodie-goodie
meddle in things like this?

80
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,325
He's a chatter-box!

81
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,324
My Son!

82
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,443
How did you get here?

83
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,169
I wrote you just yesterday.

84
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,683
You look pitiful...

85
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,006
Welcome brother!

86
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,407
Thanks.

87
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,086
I thought you were on the Russian front.

88
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,161
I was.

89
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,562
But I got wounded so they
sent me home.

90
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,641
Now Jane is there.

91
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,286
We haven't heard about him for
more than a year.

92
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,082
Well, take a seat.
I'll give you something to eat.

93
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,047
And Stefan?

94
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,490
He's studying. He should come tomorrow
for a vacation.

95
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,922
And you, how have you been?

96
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,040
I escaped.

97
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,523
Escaped?

98
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,331
I couldn't stay with the Germans.

99
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,768
Nobody means anything to them.

100
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,810
You cannot imagine what sort of slaves
they would like to make of us.

101
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,724
Hey slackers, papers. Where are you
coming from and who are you?

102
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,321
Stefan Svrcina, student of philosophy.

103
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,971
Eva Lieskovska, student of medicine.

104
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,407
The daughter of the local teacher?

105
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,322
Yes.

106
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,842
And you, where are your papers?

107
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,403
Look. calluses.

108
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,565
Where are you coming from?

109
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,324
- From Bratislava.
- For a holiday.

110
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,164
You'll have an exciting holiday.

111
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,323
- When does it start?
- We are just waiting for you.

112
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,041
Wipe that smile off your face,
we can even be useful for you.

113
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,451
For example?

114
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,330
For example... you can get ill and...

115
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,084
Excellent! You'll bandage me up,

116
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,731
when a German bullet makes
a hole in me, Miss. Medico!

117
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,326
Almost a medico. But I know
how to work with bandages.

118
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,006
So, see you in the field hospital!
Bye!

119
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,402
Bye!

120
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,884
- Bye!
- Bye!

121
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,971
What did you read about?

122
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,528
That Germans were able to get free
of the enemy.

123
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,162
Russians knocked the spots off
them again.

124
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,246
- Where are the Russians?
- They allegedly taking over Kiev.

125
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,688
If they press forward like this,
they'll be here at any moment.

126
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,646
I wish they were already here.

127
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,882
I wish you didn't regret it.

128
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,645
If you knew the front and katyushas,

129
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,002
you'd be feel differently
about the Russians.

130
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,051
It's true. We like it that way.

131
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:20,082
What would happen if the Germans won.
Did you ever think of that?

132
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,767
Don't you know that the German
respects only the German.

133
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:29,210
My friend had a terrible accident
in the dock-yard.

134
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,921
He died immediately.

135
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,844
You know what the supervisor said?

136
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,289
At least we'll have one less
Slavic dog.

137
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,011
And our companions fight for this nation.

138
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,163
Don't worry, you'll also go,
if they call you.

139
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,208
I'm not arguing.

140
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,523
But if I get a gun, I'll know,
where to go with it.

141
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,568
Perhaps to join the partisans.

142
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,688
Guys, put out the fire!

143
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,730
It might rush us into danger.

144
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,928
Water, Ondro!

145
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,161
Step on it!

146
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,323
Jump on it!

147
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,684
- It was German.
- It was Russian.

148
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,082
They drop it for partisans.

149
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,285
Let's go!

150
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,442
Watch out in the valley!

151
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,481
- Do you belong to us?
- Yes.

152
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,208
My name is Matus.

153
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,405
I'm Nikita.

154
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,839
Would you be so kind to bring me
some water.

155
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,650
I would.

156
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,925
I'll also bring you something to eat.

157
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,845
It's not necessary.

158
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,610
But come back alone.

159
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,047
Do you understand?

160
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,844
Don't be afraid, Nikita!

161
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,644
Greetings to you!

162
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,886
- What's the matter with you? Are you ok?
- The leg is ok.

163
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,483
Who are you?

164
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,086
The woodman, from the valley.

165
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,164
This is Matus, my friend!

166
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,244
I would perish without him.

167
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,563
They threw it down by mistake
over your fire.

168
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,167
The next time you hear a plane,
put out the fire.

169
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,131
- Do you understand?
- I do!

170
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,125
Thanks. you helped him.

171
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,206
- What's your name?
- Matus Svrcina.

172
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:13,004
Why did you escape from Germany?

173
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,164
It's none of your business?

174
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,931
How do you know I was in Germany?

175
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,571
It's none of your business!

176
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,324
It's all about something else.

177
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,562
We've got wounded people.
we need bandages and plaster.

178
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,244
- Do you understand?
- I do.

179
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,800
It is necessary to go to the village
and to send

180
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,002
a reliable woman with this to the teacher.

181
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,807
He already knows what to do.

182
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,130
A rucksack with bandages and other stuff
only a women could carry,

183
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,283
a guy would be conspicuous.

184
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,126
But I cannot leave my work.

185
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,329
You can leave at night and return
early in the morning.

186
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,121
You'll do it, you belong to us after all!

187
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,602
I'm Marian.

188
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,765
We'll see each other later.

189
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,730
'En

190
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,122
Who?

191
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,250
It's nice you came.

192
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,846
I've already heard you were at home.

193
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,369
Don't worry I didn't come for your sake.

194
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,047
We just need your help.

195
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,681
We've got wounded companions,
partisans.

196
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,846
You get up early, go for
the teacher and give this to him.

197
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,962
It is necessary to take a backpack
with bandages and other stuff up.

198
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,771
A man would be conspicuous.

199
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,605
I'll wait for you under the glade.

200
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,969
Be careful and not a word to anyone!

201
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,130
So, I...

202
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,530
Go to bed, I'll go.

203
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:31,927
Did I offend somehow,
that now you talk to me like that?

204
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,043
Do you know where Matus is?

205
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,920
He went down to the glade.
Probably to the village.

206
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,401
Who the devil would drag him
to the village for the night?

207
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,721
Most likely a she devil.

208
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,849
Does he already have one?

209
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,969
Old love never rusts!

210
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,486
Maybe he was pining for his mum.

211
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,369
Or for Anna.

212
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,442
Hope he didn't go there in vain.

213
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,568
Hope he didn't go there in vain.

214
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,406
Stop with this... saw!

215
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,560
You're a disgrace!

216
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,928
You're worse than a woman!

217
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,527
- Good morning!
- Tastes differ.

218
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,125
Didn't you sleep well?

219
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,762
Of course. I did. it's better to sleep
in the chalet... than in a room.

220
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,485
Of course, it's better.

221
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,485
Wait! Where were you?

222
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,807
In the village.

223
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,008
What the hell were you doing
in the village at night?

224
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,641
Are you a priest asking me
to make confession?

225
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,803
- Where were you?
- What is it to you?!

226
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,528
You!

227
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,640
Have you gone out of your mind?

228
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,530
Have you gone out of your mind?

229
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,242
Greet the boys and hurry up.

230
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,923
It's ok, it's well positioned.

231
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,366
Your Anca is bringing medicine
for partisans.

232
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,442
I'll go and meet her.

233
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,731
Tell it to Ondrej,
so he's not out of his mind about it.

234
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,724
Can't you tell him by yourself?

235
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,681
No, he can't control himself.

236
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,244
Watch out in the valley!

237
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,124
Don't release it!

238
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,123
It can kill me!

239
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,529
Don't release it!

240
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,281
Ondrej, the timber is approaching!
What's up?

241
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,523
My leg!

242
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,281
Go away, it'll kill you also!

243
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,362
Leave me alone! You fool!

244
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,045
I'll be crippled for the rest of my life.
He should have let me been killed.

245
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,442
It's not like that! He saved your life.

246
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,525
What shall I do with such life,
I'll be a burden to everyone.

247
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,087
Don't worry, I'll...

248
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,283
And how about my brother?

249
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,890
He sends his best regards to you.

250
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,602
He asked you to forgive him
and that he'll never come home again.

251
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,248
He's lost his mind.
He's taking up with partisans.

252
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,887
Ready, you can start!

253
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,446
You have to hold it strong!

254
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,882
This way!

255
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,202
Shoot. the whole cartridge.

256
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,569
He's pierced like a...

257
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,246
I wouldn't like to be your target.

258
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,803
He's a devil. not a man!

259
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,442
Look, commander what did this
greenhorn do!

260
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,284
You've got good eyes.

261
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,523
- Weren't you a poacher?
- Me not, but my father was.

262
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,331
He was a woodsman, but he strayed
to hunting grounds that were off-limits.

263
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,970
Like all the guys.

264
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,250
Once he came home riddled with bullets
just like this board.

265
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,729
Commander Marian!

266
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,851
Liaison from Bystrica!

267
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,207
'MW.

268
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,167
How are things going?

269
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,130
German traders are loading wagons
in Malobrod.

270
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,804
150 head of cattle.

271
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,245
The train departs tonight.

272
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,448
In Lukotin there is platoon of infantrymen.

273
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,922
They going to start ridding the mountains
of partisans in the morning.

274
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,321
That's all.

275
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,962
You take twelve companions.

276
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,170
These cattle must not leave.
Neither these traders.

277
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,730
Yes, Commander!

278
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,691
I myself will go against those foot soldiers.

279
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,685
Commander, I'd like to go with you.

280
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,491
You can.

281
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,365
Well, let's go guys!

282
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,211
Just like we agreed.

283
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,965
Stay within sight, is it clear?

284
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,281
- Yes it is.
- We do understand.

285
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,601
Let's go!

286
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,010
Mr. General, do you have a match?

287
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,770
Here you are.

288
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,048
You almost smoked you fingers.

289
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,124
Here you are one Russian.

290
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,444
Thank you.

291
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,009
Stop guys!

292
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,129
I'm partisan Marian.

293
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,407
They sent you to fight against us
because we want ones just like you:

294
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,326
to chase Germans out of our country
and to help truth and law win out.

295
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,280
I didn't come with a gun in my hand.

296
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,603
So, you've got only two possibilities:

297
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,082
either to go back or to join us.

298
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,208
If you come as a friend, we'll be friends,
but if you've come as an enemy,

299
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,002
we'll be enemies.

300
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,400
In this region all the trees
are shooting at us.

301
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,686
So. what guys?

302
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,923
Where are we going boys?

303
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,809
To the mountains!

304
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,924
To the mountains!

305
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,527
We all felt that the Germans lost
on the very day that they attacked Russia.

306
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,251
Ok, you all felt it, but kept silent.

307
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,721
Now you are here,
so don't argue all the time.

308
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,326
It's not a quarrel.
It's a political discussion.

309
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,482
Thank you.

310
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,286
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

311
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,924
Today you won't avoid us.

312
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,765
Here you are, run for home.

313
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,161
Ondrej has returned.

314
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,607
His wound has perfectly healed.

315
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,082
He'll get an artificial limb and he’ll probably
be able to walk like before.

316
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,970
Come, he'll be glad.

317
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,121
I'd rather not, I'm afraid.

318
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,969
You know how he behaved
to me in the hospital.

319
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,522
If you had known
how eager he was to see you.

320
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,366
One who loses his reputation,
he loses sympathy too.

321
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,967
I just lost a part of my leg
and so many people forgot me.

322
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,761
Look, who came to see you.

323
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,049
Stefan, come in the room!

324
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,881
- We haven't seen each other for ages.
- it's true.

325
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,440
A lot has changed.

326
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,205
You're only imagining things.

327
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,490
I'm not. I saw it.

328
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,802
I thought you greeted
me differently.

329
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,451
Wait!

330
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,524
Do you swear to tell the truth?

331
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,927
Did something happen between you
and Matus?

332
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,530
You know we were in love and
he went to Germany just because of you.

333
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,163
I'll come back when you are more rested.

334
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,607
Stem!

335
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,329
What are you carrying?

336
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,290
Check the registration number!

337
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,841
- Matus, what are you carrying?
- Eggs.

338
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,611
You'll need them.

339
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,890
Today a German general and his escort
was shot by our people.

340
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,166
- It will be chaos...
- I've already heard it.

341
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,242
Hey man. answer respectfully!

342
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,526
What's up there?

343
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,523
I asked him what he's carrying and he...
that eggs.

344
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,005
And moreover he laughs like a hyena.

345
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,162
Oh...

346
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,567
'ml Mm

347
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,721
Where are you coming from?

348
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,689
They sent us to the Italian front,

349
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,843
meanwhile I jumped out to have some water
and the train had already left.

350
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,730
I thought I'd pop home.

351
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,371
Aha. what are you carrying.

352
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,964
All right! Drive on!

353
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,122
So. what are they carrying?

354
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,809
Don't be angry but they're really
carrying grenades.

355
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,166
Janko, stay until tomorrow at least.

356
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,288
Here you are, eat!

357
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,003
Could you pack me something,
I'll eat it on the road.

358
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,607
My children, don't leave me.

359
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,523
How can I get you back together again?

360
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,170
He has to go!

361
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,004
As long as he' not in the army,
he is in a safe place here.

362
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,560
What kind of safety is it,
if they give him a weapon?

363
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,971
He won't shoot at himself.

364
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,203
I know, at the enemy.

365
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,366
And is this good?

366
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,331
Does the enemy's mother
love her son any less?

367
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,485
Each mother is worried about
her children.

368
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,562
I saw in Russia how children were
killed in front of their moms.

369
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,167
Only tit for tat helps!

370
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,040
What's your perspective if
you want to knock the eye out

371
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,930
of an enemy forty times more powerful?

372
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,411
Don't worry!

373
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,086
You know how David defeated Goliath?

374
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,329
He slung a rock into his forehead.
From a long distance!

375
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,291
That's what we are also going to do.
One by one. That's why we're partisans!

376
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,601
They'll crush you like ash!

377
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,885
Would you like to fight against tanks
with machine guns?

378
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,691
You've all gone mad!

379
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,888
What is it all for?

380
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,566
What's the use of the war for us?

381
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,688
Who did you hurt?

382
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,649
Absolutely nobody.

383
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,610
You don't know what would happen,
if the Germans won.

384
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,765
They'll surely run away from you!

385
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,690
So, goodbye mum!

386
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,530
We'll be back in few days.

387
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,729
I know, you are with us but
not in front of mom.

388
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,850
Svrcinas always know where they
belong.

389
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,689
Mrs. Forester!

390
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,562
Jane has come.

391
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,047
Well, I'm going-

392
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,284
I just wanted to see Jano.

393
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,049
For the homeland!

394
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,282
Nothing for me?

395
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,681
And it's already here.

396
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,360
You've already finished playing
the partisans.

397
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,331
The leader has invited German troops
to protect the inhabitants.

398
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,644
Just wait, they will give you
national committees!

399
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,802
They'll give you “Death to fascism...

400
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,769
They'll set you straight.

401
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,922
They're eating us out even more.

402
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,810
Shut up!
I forbid it!

403
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,360
I'm not only your father,
but also the commissar of this village.

404
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,408
We're finished with partisans from now!

405
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:43,126
Partisan, German, partisan,
German, partisan,

406
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,043
German...

407
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,044
You cannot be German.

408
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,851
You're too small to fight.

409
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,321
Go to the partisans.

410
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,405
Partisans, on my side
Germans beyond the road!

411
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,089
You see my father.

412
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,164
He doesn't allow me to tune in
any music.

413
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,322
I've got a headache
from this strumming.

414
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,246
It's a very serious time, my son,
we guys take it differently.

415
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,130
Clear. everything is clear.

416
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,204
A step to Berlin, from Vienna
to Hungary two steps,

417
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,282
The Russians will be here in a month.

418
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,805
Don't tamper with this radio!

419
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,486
I haven't been able to tune in Bratislava
since morning.

420
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,846
It's a very serious time, my son.

421
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,242
It may be a serious time,
but we can handle it.

422
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,166
Dad. just a little music.

423
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,284
Here you are!

424
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,964
- Were you also stung?
- Right in my face!

425
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,523
For this, as of today, the power
in Slovakia is assumed by

426
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,331
the Slovak National Council and
it's subordinated organs.

427
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,210
Children come here, it's already here!
Revolution!

428
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,282
For we ask soldiers and
Fighting-competent men

429
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,364
to report for duty at
the nearest barracks.

430
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,364
We request officers, gendarmes and
the treasury guard

431
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,842
to rise up and protect
the country.

432
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,729
Citizens and soldiers,

433
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,451
stop the progress of the army
of occupation from Germany!

434
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,524
Fight hard and wisely
against the invaders,

435
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,207
keep strict discipline
and obey you commanders,

436
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,647
who lead you against the Germans.

437
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,691
Slovaks, go to war
against the occupants and fascism!

438
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,967
Be ready to fight for a better future!

439
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,840
Fight for the right of workers,
farmers and all of working people,

440
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,763
fight against domestic conspiracy,

441
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,845
which plunged the Slovak nation
into war against fraternal Russia

442
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,571
and other Slavic nations.

443
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,927
Long live our just cause,

444
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,049
long live the Czechoslovak Republic!

445
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,964
Death to the German occupants!

446
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,204
MOBILIZATION ORDER

447
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,806
Now we have to act.

448
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,089
Yes, Stefan.

449
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,848
Look!

450
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,204
Good-bye!

451
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,968
Goodbye Dad!

452
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,921
If you need to, then go,
but I'm not sending you.

453
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,288
If everyone goes...

454
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,367
And then we'll be together forever.

455
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,728
Yes. my dear, my only one.

456
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,240
Stefan, come on,
they're waiting for us!

457
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,129
Good bye, Evicka and Mr. Teacher!

458
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,123
- Good bye Stefan, and be careful!
- Good bye!

459
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,727
Not goodbye. but so long!

460
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,521
I also was a soldier and I returned.

461
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,927
Goodbye!

462
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,402
Make a report on the situation after the
artillery support!

463
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,086
Yes, I'll connect.

464
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,640
I'll tell you Mr. Doctor,

465
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:47,569
two wars in one human life are
too much.

466
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,361
The Fuhrer says something else.

467
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,604
Well, sleep now.

468
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,924
I'm surprised how humanly
you treat them

469
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,968
after all that you've been through.

470
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,409
The doctor doesn't differentiate
between nations and race.

471
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,847
He doesn't have to cure only body
deformations,

472
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,844
but also the distortion of minds
and hearts.

473
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,686
With fanatics like they are
we'll still have much to do.

474
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,885
I don't understand. What did he say?

475
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,567
The southern part of the front was
invaded by German forces

476
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,642
two kilometers deep.

477
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,247
The enemy wasn't successful in breaking
through the front in other sectors

478
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,767
because of strong resistance from our
positions.

479
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,003
More information in the
morning news.

480
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,367
Death to the German occupants!

481
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,841
What's going to happen to us?

482
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,490
We've got to hold out until
The Russians arrive.

483
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,086
Where is the front?

484
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,162
All around us.

485
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,288
The Germans are surrounding us.

486
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,409
Somehow like this...

487
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,370
is our belligerent territory.

488
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,089
It's like we're in a trap.

489
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,529
I predicted that it would be a lost war.

490
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:16,403
While we have bastions like Telgert,
Svaty Kriz, Tisovec,

491
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,845
we shouldn't be discouraged.

492
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,844
But where will we be
when the Germans come?

493
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,685
You don't have to run away,
you won't be hurt.

494
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,764
My son also fights against
the Germans.

495
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,162
Give thanks to God he went to save
your name and reputation!

496
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,961
Germans are superior in number,
but we don't have to be scared shitless.

497
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,964
In the end we will win, even though...

498
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,567
Tisovec has fallen!

499
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,448
Get out of the way with this instrument!

500
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,723
Our guys will be here at any moment.

501
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,371
It's the same for me.

502
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,604
Hitler can lick my...

503
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:19,611
Jesus Christ!

504
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,082
- Good Lord, where will we put them?
- Don't worry nurse.

505
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,960
It is the last transport.
Serious cases.

506
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,444
I asked about this Svrcina.
Nobody knows him.

507
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,370
And those 15 Czech gendarmes who
came to the front the day before yesterday,

508
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,480
they were all killed.

509
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,411
Yes, it's me.

510
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,642
They got me.

511
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,724
They've riddled my belly with bullets.

512
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,442
Repay them with interest
once you recover.

513
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:23,162
Not until tomorrow and
tomorrow they'll already be here.

514
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,562
They plowed into us with tanks
against machine guns

515
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,487
Don't speak, you'll hurt yourself.

516
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,488
Not any more, Miss. Medico.

517
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,606
We'll examine you in a moment.

518
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,287
I'll bring you a painkiller.

519
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,609
We sort out easier cases.
they'll go to Headquarters.

520
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,286
Those who are able to walk,
leave on foot.

521
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,762
They all have to be gone
by tomorrow.

522
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,606
If you want to go home then go.

523
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,045
Tomorrow will be too late.

524
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,841
- And you, Sir lieutenant colonel?
- I'm a doctor.

525
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,049
I also want to be a doctor.

526
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,329
Don't be angry, I thought...

527
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,122
I forgot you should leave first.

528
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:29,481
Excuse me, I'm also a doctor at first,
and then...

529
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,970
You should leave.

530
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,566
You know, what the Germans are like.

531
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:42,885
You need to know all sorts of things
to understand,

532
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,601
I don't have anything to lose.

533
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:52,967
The last time I saw my mom, was when
she was taken to the gas chamber

534
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,443
through the yard.

535
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,962
And once the man gets there...

536
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:09,050
it's all over in two minutes.

537
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,604
We call Daffodil!
Halloo, Daffodil!

538
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:02,241
We call Daffodil!
Halloo! Daffodil?

539
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:20,047
I cannot hear you, speak louder!

540
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,683
Halloo, who's speaking? Svrcina?

541
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,006
Is that you, Jano? What's up?

542
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,806
The whole unit was disabled...

543
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,724
Halloo. Jano!

544
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,040
What's going on?

545
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,964
It was my brother! I've got to
get him out of there!

546
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:57,602
Marian greets you.

547
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,767
Marian greets you.

548
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,290
- Good evening Sir.
- Good evening.

549
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:20,081
Please do something for
my friend.

550
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,291
He's probably got pneumonia.

551
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,967
Maybe something worse.

552
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:34,811
You are allegedly a friend of ours.

553
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,528
Calm down, we are going to take
care of him.

554
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,967
Thanks.

555
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:54,284
Save their young lives
and keep danger away from them.

556
01:02:55,560 --> 01:03:00,407
God Almighty, take care of my children

557
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,087
and protect them from Evil.

558
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,841
Home...

559
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,402
Sieg heil!

560
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,085
Lieutenant Colonel Bukovsky
reporting on the condition of the hospital.

561
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,164
Three doctors,
six nurses...

562
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,601
All of them are partisans?

563
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,728
Soldiers.

564
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,045
I understand.

565
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:04,601
Check the personnel!

566
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,921
- Good care?
- Thanks, quite good.

567
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,445
But Franzl there in the corner
told me...

568
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:32,007
Put on your clothes!
You're being arrested!

569
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,641
Stand up!

570
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:44,048
Hell!

571
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,325
Jew. As usual?

572
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,246
Of course!

573
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,370
The Gestapo will come,

574
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:37,444
and they'll ask you who was a member of
the national committee,

575
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,922
who had his son in the army
or with partisans.

576
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,129
Please, don't let anything slip.

577
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:48,205
It would be better to tear out your tongue
than to betray.

578
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:52,524
I didn't send my son against them
it was your government!

579
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,490
And where is he now?

580
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:59,849
My only son, my good...

581
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,726
The Lord gives and the Lord takes away.
Others were killed too.

582
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,327
It's up to you now to prevent
there being any more victims.

583
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,644
You belong to them, you'll be asked
eventually.

584
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,722
The rest of us we know,
what our is duty.

585
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,685
To push on and help those
in the mountains.

586
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:49,846
Wait, don't smoke. It'll stunt your growth.

587
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,249
I don't understand.
Why don't they answer?

588
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,129
Call Kiev once again!

589
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,364
Kiev has not answered for three days.

590
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:07,930
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

591
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:24,649
Are you crazy? The man can't even
warm himself?

592
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,769
You'll get warm soon enough just wait.

593
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,171
Put out the fire!

594
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,925
While we're waiting for other orders,

595
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,968
we'll pitch a camp in Jastrabie.

596
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,771
We'll stay in a lumber camp.

597
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,842
The entrance to the valley is narrow.

598
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,321
If I'm not mistaken, there is also
an antitank barricade.

599
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,687
There is.

600
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,604
- Do you know it?
- Od course.

601
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,843
It's 5 km across the hills to
our village.

602
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,606
Even better. Just to be
ready against Germans.

603
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:02,083
Two will guard the entrance of the
valley of the WOLVES' LAIRS.

604
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,640
Who volunteers?

605
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,126
Me.

606
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,006
Me too.

607
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,889
Good.

608
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,965
You'll get ammunition.
the rest is up to you.

609
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:24,481
Get ready!
We'll have a lot of work to do.

610
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,369
The password is: Wolves' Lairs.

611
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,089
Where are you going?

612
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,211
OK, 909 go" '

613
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,521
Is everything ok?

614
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,127
I succeeded in passing over.
There were only two down.

615
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,001
Happy-go-lucky!

616
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,971
What? With partisans?

617
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,963
Well. all right.

618
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,930
Shoot twenty civil citizens!

619
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:05,164
Yes!

620
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,924
Boys, look!

621
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,600
A telephone!

622
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:37,881
Let's find the other one and
we can call each other.

623
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,611
Kn“

624
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:46,926
But let's first swear an oath
that we won't tell anyone.

625
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,167
Welcome!

626
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,761
How about in our village?

627
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,969
Nothing, Germans sometimes
appear in the village.

628
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:53,443
Mom is more satisfied since
she found out your brothers are alive.

629
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,966
A bread...

630
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,485
Ondrej is moody as always

631
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:05,806
and Anca is sending you a... sausage.

632
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,090
I hope you share it with me?

633
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,323
Be careful, don't let it run dry.

634
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,722
You have.

635
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,282
I know you have.

636
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:51,125
So, have you already had
German visitors?

637
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,886
No. Germans didn't like
the Wolves' Lairs very much.

638
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,804
Look what Marian sent me for them.

639
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,607
Show me!

640
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:08,649
I'll shoot the cigarette
from your mouth at 100 paces.

641
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:12,486
Nice...

642
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:47,087
Come here!

643
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,486
Help for partisans!

644
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,849
- Damn thing! They're only children.
- Nice kids!

645
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,287
- Stop!
- Have you gone mad?

646
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:11,444
Matus, I swear to God
they are coming!

647
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:17,089
You always wanted to have skis,
now you can immediately have four pairs.

648
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,844
Tell me when I have to shoot.

649
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,644
Not with a machine gun,
don't waste the ammunition.

650
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,121
Senseless rattle.
Take a riffle!

651
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:28,366
None of them could return,
he could remember the place.

652
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:37,962
What are you looking for here, gents?
Who called you here?

653
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:41,920
The Rulers of Europe,
who shoot at children!

654
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,961
I never thought I could shoot at
an unsuspecting man,

655
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:52,888
but at you, yes, for you don't respect
anyone or anything.

656
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,207
I'll take those two on the right.

657
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,442
Me the rest.

658
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,126
- Mud
-31

659
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:05,603
Whistle!
When they stop, shoot!

660
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,529
You see, how they were stunned.
Let's go!

661
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:31,802
Bungler! Shoot with this one!

662
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,207
Wait until he comes down.

663
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,287
He runs like a scared puppy.

664
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,760
So, hold your breath...

665
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:59,448
Right. it's for those kids.

666
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,446
Poor Janko and Stefan they probably
haven't eaten anything warm for a long time.

667
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,842
Stop whining.

668
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,811
If it was my fault they're,
not at home.

669
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,402
Who is coming over here again?

670
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:26,369
- For the homeland!
- Good afternoon.

671
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:36,281
All right, I'll stay here.

672
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:40,490
They would like to stay overnight here.

673
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:42,802
.0.I...

674
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:49,206
Well. guest in house, God in house.

675
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:56,285
Would you make me some warm tea?

676
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:03,881
We don't have tea. but I'll heat up
some chicken soup if you want.

677
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,209
That'll be fine.

678
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,209
Invalid?

679
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,482
- The Russian front?
- Yes.

680
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:21,690
Very good.

681
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,082
Her sons'?

682
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,891
- Yes please.
- Where are they?

683
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:17,364
One is at home, the others,
I've no idea.

684
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,367
Ok.

685
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:26,811
As you know. four of us were killed.

686
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,885
I could give an order to kill the
whole village, but I won't do it.

687
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,531
I want to have the guilty ones.

688
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,168
You've told us how many men
are missing in the village,

689
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:41,245
you should also tell us where
they are in hiding

690
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:45,450
I don't know it.

691
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,765
I'm sorry, but you must remember.

692
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:57,248
- Come back in half an hour.
- Yes, Sir!

693
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:15,041
Nice guys.

694
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:19,120
Tell your sons they can
come home.

695
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,680
We won't do anything to them.

696
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:28,405
Mr. Officer, they're only children,
who could hurt them?

697
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,246
Sure, nothing will happen to them.

698
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:37,242
Ok, I'll come back again
tomorrow around lunchtime.

699
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,806
Maybe not all Germans are
the same.

700
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:55,283
I can't even imagine they could
kill children.

701
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,806
You'd better not mention it to anybody.

702
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,723
Three kids haven't been found yet.

703
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,240
They could just be wandering
around somewhere.

704
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:05,324
It just came to my mind.

705
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:10,884
He said he would bring my sons home.
Good man.

706
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:15,360
- What's his name?
- Herman Thiele.

707
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:59,369
He can go.
He didn't see or hear anything.

708
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:02,002
It's not true... I...

709
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,368
it's they're...violators!

710
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,488
Murderers!

711
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:41,331
Is there anybody called Svrcina here?

712
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,405
His mom is waiting for him.

713
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:53,123
So none?

714
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:00,887
It's a pity, he could have gone home.

715
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:08,566
It's me... I'm Svrcina.

716
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:17,687
You can go.

717
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:27,251
Go!

718
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,725
Attention!

719
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:08,841
Come here!

720
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:11,446
Come here!

721
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,931
I know him, he is a deaf-mute.
He is an idiot.

722
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:22,211
Idiot?

723
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,010
He can hear!

724
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,562
Stem!

725
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,087
Damned guy! Stop!

726
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,766
Put down this box!

727
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:52,001
So. It was him...

728
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:10,691
Well, this will have implications.

729
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,600
Look!

730
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,890
Go!

731
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,445
That's enough! Let's go on!

732
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:36,523
Don't cry, I also have such
little a boy at home.

733
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,967
- Let's have a look!
- Aha, a joyful widow.

734
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,131
Are you afraid?

735
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:49,366
I'm not afraid but you're German and
my father has to hide!

736
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:54,287
I'm not a German. If I were,
you wouldn't understand me.

737
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:58,081
So why are you friends with them?

738
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:00,481
Germans are bad!

739
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:21,003
Very good. It tastes very good.

740
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:29,884
Everything's all right.

741
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:35,967
Here's your son as I promised you.

742
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:03,771
My son...

743
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,961
Go, go...

744
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,764
Can I have some more.

745
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:49,451
You don't even cry
and it was your son.

746
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:16,241
My God! Father!

747
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:24,728
Our Father who art in heaven...

748
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,887
Be quite! Stand up!

749
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:59,009
My father!

750
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:03,286
My goodness, don't kill him!

751
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:09,526
You can't kill him! Let me go!

752
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:37,482
Tell my daughter
that her father died like a Man.

753
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:41,360
- Long live liberty!
- Long live liberty!

754
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:21,530
Yes, it's terrible that I'm not able to
snipe at the Germans

755
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:26,162
and then watch restfully how,
they hang old people and beat women.

756
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:31,610
Those, who know how to do it are Men
and Heroes. I can't do it.

757
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:35,287
But I'm sure that they have on
their conscience the death of our Jano,

758
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:38,330
Stefan and all of those, who...

759
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:00,642
What is it?
What happened?

760
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,729
What's with Joiko?

761
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:09,006
- He' 5 dead.
- Jane and 'Stefan are dead.

762
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:13,808
- My father is dead.
- The teacher is dead.

763
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:17,202
Eighteen dead men in the village
and in sheds!

764
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:21,569
Now go, before it's too late and donVt
show up in this house any more!

765
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:22,846
Go away!

766
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:26,845
You rush us into danger!
Think of your mom!

767
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:30,208
You're talking like a sick man!

768
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:33,569
If there were no mothers and you,
whom Germans could pour their anger on,

769
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:36,530
then you would see
how many Germans would die daily!

770
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,011
I have never expected anything
from you!

771
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:41,323
Don't give me a lecture, just go away!
You are responsible for everything!

772
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,284
No!

773
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:53,525
God, why do brothers hate each other?

774
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,965
What's going on with you?

775
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:01,170
Till just recently you were playing and
having fun together.

776
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:05,923
And suddenly your heart is
full of hate.

777
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:16,844
My goodness, Germans!
Matus, hide!

778
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,128
No, no!

779
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:25,687
Go! You are Slavonian.

780
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:46,643
Allegedly somebody entered the house.

781
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,930
Me.

782
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,729
Let's have a look.

783
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,561
Don't shoot. I'm Polish.

784
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:36,929
I've got a wife and two kids at home.

785
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:44,084
Go.

786
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:11,645
- So, what's up?
- Nothing. Nobody is here.

787
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:25,761
Matus, my son!

788
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:36,928
What's the name of the one
who gave the order to kill our men?

789
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:05,241
Hands UP!

790
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:07,766
Don't be scared. I won't shoot.

791
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:13,051
I'm not with the Germans voluntarily.
I had to.

792
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,689
I'll go with you.

793
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:24,162
- Do you know where Herman Thiele lives?
- I do.

794
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:29,446
Come!

795
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:39,806
On this very day they were buried
in a mass-grave.

796
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:46,563
Poor father... Poor Stefan.

797
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:56,644
Where does Herman Thiele live?

798
01:39:57,080 --> 01:40:01,051
Allegedly somewhere in a small town.

799
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:08,003
Why don't people understand that violence
breeds violence and death only death!

800
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,605
Go guys!

801
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:13,685
Arrest him alive and he'll be
brought to a partisan court.

802
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,047
Nikita, take command and control.

803
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:20,842
I accept command and control.
You can rely on me.

804
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:24,322
The Germans will remember it!

805
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:40,365
Damned boy!

806
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:42,886
It's my turn now.

807
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,690
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

808
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:14,761
Then slowly burn his tongue.

809
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:19,600
Ready!

810
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:32,244
- To the Partisan Court!
- Let's go!

811
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:55,601
What is it now? Another killed?

812
01:42:55,680 --> 01:43:00,925
My goodness! Alarm!

813
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:32,489
They're already coming, the devils!
Let's go!

814
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:06,124
Don't be afraid, nothing will happen to you.

815
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:11,730
Mr. Doctor, won't I have a limp?
My spouse wouldn't be able to bear it.

816
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:16,283
I think she would.
You'll get tea in a moment.

817
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:20,285
Call headquarters,
Tell them I'm seriously wounded.

818
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:29,682
- Is it him?
- Yes, but evil herb never dies out.

819
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:33,048
He's got only frozen legs.

820
01:44:56,440 --> 01:45:00,411
I've got to go to the city
in the afternoon.

821
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:16,920
Good morning.

822
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:25,687
- Where are you from?
- From here.

823
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:29,765
I treat Slovak soldiers.

824
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:36,849
Something else?

825
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:40,730
Yes.

826
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:51,360
Drink.

827
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:03,850
Man never knows what the future
holds for him in this damned country.

828
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:01,721
Help!

829
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,922
Come!

830
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:40,489
Matus has been seriously wounded.

831
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:45,485
They somehow got into the Wolves' Lairs
together with Joiko.

832
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:49,963
Those who were with them, all died.
Also Marian and the others in the valley.

833
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,963
Allegedly, there were too many Germans.

834
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:54,691
My God, I can't leave him
without help.

835
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:57,491
I'll go for him, I'll take only
the most essential things.

836
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:00,325
Have you gone mad?
How do you wanna go there?

837
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,607
- I'll go there first.
- You're not going anywhere!

838
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:06,685
If we need woman nursing,
I'll let you know.

839
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:09,570
Give me some bandages.

840
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,726
Go and stay at our place and don't say
a word about Matus to mom.

841
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:23,007
Always have some food ready.

842
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:25,924
And if possible some alcohol too.

843
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,004
Let's go! Goodbye!

844
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,647
I'm afraid he won't survive it.

845
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,210
That man can bear a lot.

846
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:51,841
He has five bullets in his body,
then it's not a little thing.

847
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:55,891
If his temperature goes away,
he’ll be hungry.

848
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:59,169
I wish Anca could have been here with
this medicine earlier.

849
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:02,449
None of the Germans will get through!

850
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:10,927
When I was hallucinating,
I always called for my girlfriend.

851
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,004
A hungry horse dreams of oats.

852
01:49:54,760 --> 01:50:01,484
- He called your name again.
- I can't help it and neither can he.

853
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:05,284
He doesn't even know if he's alive.
He hasn't opened his eyes for a week.

854
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:09,365
I know, you can't help that.

855
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:16,767
It won't take so much time for
you to be able to return.

856
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:42,725
- What is it now?
- Nothing.

857
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:25,562
Water. water...

858
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:32,364
What are you looking for here?

859
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:34,488
Just calm down,
you'll find out everything.

860
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:39,407
Anca is our liaison,
supplier, lady help, doctor...

861
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:42,882
in short, someone for everything.

862
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:48,202
And Ondrej is also with us.

863
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:51,802
Look, what a clever partisan he is.

864
01:51:55,960 --> 01:52:01,285
Excuse me, brother.
Now I know what I've got to do.

865
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:11,651
Matus, happy Resurrection!

866
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:23,851
Don't forget that the path under us
connects the Hron and Liptov

867
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:27,766
and the Germans will need it
while retreating.

868
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:30,525
We blast the bridge in the valley.

869
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:33,683
Block up the road with rocks, and if
necessary we batter down the whole cliff,

870
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:37,082
but not even a half German will
get through the Wolves' Lairs.

871
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:41,882
That was the order from our deceased
Marian, and we'll carry it out!

872
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:45,567
Guys. come have look!

873
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:52,082
My word, they are coming.

874
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:03,164
- A woman is coming with them.
- it's Anca!

875
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:05,242
She': leading them.

876
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:08,324
They're leading her.
Are you blind?

877
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:12,007
- Somebody betrayed her.
- That one in the black uniform.

878
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,684
Give me that machine gun!

879
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,967
- No, you can't.
- You'll hurt yourself.

880
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:18,771
I just want to see who they are.

881
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:22,242
We have to get Anca out of there.

882
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:28,081
Nothing else can help other than to
just aim well.

883
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:33,329
Clever girl. They thought she'd
lead them behind us,

884
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:36,882
and she's leading them directly
in front of our rifles.

885
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:39,566
Steady and aim your
guns at them.

886
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:44,202
The one behind Anca is mine.
Dico, that black one!

887
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,687
Attention guys!

888
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:11,645
No, Matus!

889
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:16,962
Shoot boys!

890
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:33,767
Tanks went round the mined bridge
and are heading towards the Wolves' Lairs.

891
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:37,561
You've got to disarm the first tank
and block the road.

892
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:41,440
Not even a mouse could get
through the Wolves' Lairs!

893
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:25,530
Come on everyone, open fire!

894
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:47,609
- Take it to Matus!
- I have to stay with you.

895
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:51,480
Just go, he'll need you more.

896
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:52,162
- What do you want here?
- Ondrej sends you ammunition.

897
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:54,242
Go to hell with that ammunition!
What the hell is Ondrej doing?

898
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:57,324
Grenades, grenades!

899
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:21,684
Our Ondrej has stopped them.

900
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:50,843
Goodbye!

901
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:59,641
Don't cry mom,
Everything’s gonna be alright!

902
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:01,927
We're bringing home peace!

903
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:17,166
Don't cry mom, we've won.

904
