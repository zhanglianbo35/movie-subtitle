{3371}{3457}We must get him!|- Cut him off!
{3618}{3671}I've got him!|- They've got me!
{3689}{3726}Fight your way through to our people!
{3742}{3823}- Hold out! We'll meet again!
{3839}{3923}And I never saw him again.
{3932}{4053}...your lips were so close.
{4086}{4208}As close as they could be...
{4546}{4670}...and then I was alone
{4703}{4820}and nothing is as I wished...
{4885}{4949}You can't be serious, Alfred?!
{5107}{5178}The operation's ever, Captain.|- Very good!
{5218}{5290}- How many dead?|- 138.
{5325}{5383}- Better than we expected.
{5400}{5435}- Coffee?
{5446}{5489}- Two lumps, please.
{5503}{5572}- Many died here.
{5578}{5701}...long were our kisses...
{5729}{5782}- The losses were heavy.
{5785}{5888}138 Red Indians and 47 horses.
{5892}{5999}...but I wished for more...
{6002}{6100}Beer hall - THE LODGE
{6121}{6191}The moon's
{6193}{6291}behind a cloud
{6310}{6381}my love weeps
{6385}{6469}for me aloud.
{6495}{6618}She knows a poacher's loved one
{6645}{6747}comes poor second
{6750}{6839}to his gun.|- Once more!
{6842}{6942}- She knows a poacher's loved...
{7129}{7202}...started operation and so far|as to the present day
{7204}{7290}152 cisterns and 190 vans have been|cleaned. This means that...
{7385}{7420}Who was that?
{7423}{7506}- A gipsy, dark and swarthy.|- Rascals...!
{7526}{7621}- Well, guys...|- Where beer is brewed
{7629}{7673}there people have good time
{7676}{7781}- Good night!|- Where beer is brewed
{7784}{7864}there people have good time
{7875}{7953}Let us go there and drink
{7960}{8043}let us drink it, let us drink it...
{8075}{8116}- Night, boys.
{8118}{8193}...and drink... let us drink it...
{8201}{8310}...and now, dear viewers, let me|tell you tonight's programme.
{8321}{8396}The sports review in a minute...
{9854}{9906}Well, boys?
{9970}{10034}As road users you shouldn't drink.
{10051}{10111}As if you drove a car or motorbike.
{10209}{10263}There, my friends.
{10292}{10348}Take a walk.
{10384}{10447}Fresh air breeds positive thinking.
{11040}{11086}You've sure deflated us.
{11950}{12039}Like the Blinded Bulgarians' Return.
{16858}{16913}Getaway!
{16933}{16977}You bastard!
{16980}{17025}No!
{17150}{17180}THE GARDENERS' GIFT TO KERSKO
{17534}{17578}No! Nooo!
{18109}{18163}How wonderful it would be here,
{18187}{18249}if these damn wasps were gone!
{18615}{18684}I am giving up!|He's all shitty again!
{18705}{18783}Ask for the pot, you bastard!
{18786}{18831}Or I'll beat you up!
{18834}{18897}I'm sick and tired of you.|- Where is he, damn him?
{18900}{18959}Jarry, where are you?
{18978}{19038}Loafing around again, Pop?
{19268}{19350}Siberian iris?|- Oh no!
{19353}{19389}- The celandine?|- No.
{19418}{19487}- Lilies-of-the-valley?|- No.
{19531}{19598}- Corn-flower?|- No.
{19621}{19678}- The campion?|- No.
{19712}{19772}- The brad'll be late today.
{19775}{19836}- What flower could it be?
{19850}{19913}The loveliest you say, and here?
{19933}{20005}The Anemone?|No.
{20008}{20064}The purple loosestrife, then?|No?
{20066}{20160}Now I know!|The tinted gentian!
{20175}{20210}No again?|THE GARDENERS' GIFT TO KERSKO
{20218}{20260}Which then, dammit?
{20262}{20351}- Surely not the Siberian Iris?
{20356}{20388}- No!
{20390}{20461}- Which, then?|- The potato!
{20469}{20535}- I'm hungry by two|when I don't have dumplings.
{20537}{20591}- Potatoes are my favourite.
{20600}{20675}Potatoes for the pig and piggie for me.
{21075}{21133}Go grazing
{21136}{21218}or you'll be back late!|D'you hear?!
{21221}{21286}- It would be wonderful here if...|- What?
{21288}{21378}- Jarry, where are you?|Who're you gabbing with now?
{21387}{21506}Where are you?|- I'm here. Enjoying the wonders.
{21515}{21577}- What?|- You've been gone half an hour!
{21580}{21681}- Quarter of an hour!|- Half an hour!
{21696}{21755}Wonderful it would be...
{21759}{21788}You have been gone for half an hour,|- Gone for half an hour...
{21790}{21832}...so admit it, at least!|- Well, talk!
{21834}{21858}- The clock doesn't lie.|- So admit it!
{21861}{21890}- Now talk, say it!
{21893}{21979}...bloody wasps and tyrannical|screaming!
{22000}{22061}- Gone for half an hour!
{22077}{22136}- I plead guilty.
{23961}{24075}The potato is an orchid.|Even when it starts germinating.
{24215}{24270}The sprouts are milky tubes.
{24284}{24388}I plant the sprouts gently
{24396}{24488}into soil a loose as ground coffee.
{24511}{24581}When the first sprout shoots out -
{24584}{24623}what joy...
{24631}{24713}When the potato blooms|it has a small blossom
{24718}{24785}like a violet - with a yellow dot.
{24821}{24901}With these hands I dig up the fruit
{24912}{24973}of the lovelies flower in the world.
{25088}{25153}Some hooligans escaped from jail, I bet.
{25156}{25204}I'll leave the shop lights on.
{26998}{27114}High time you're taking us out!|Tending your family for once!
{27213}{27315}I can smell mushrooms.
{27919}{28007}Where are you off to?!|- Have you gone mad, Pop?
{28010}{28085}- Hey, Jarry!|- You have gone mad, haven't you?
{28087}{28121}- Damn it!|- Come back!
{28124}{28169}- We want to go home!|- Aren't we going for a trip?
{28172}{28237}- You'll be beggared again!
{28616}{28704}Hey, geezer...!|I've had just about enough!
{28710}{28810}- Come back, you crazy old man!|- Oh, shit...
{28818}{28880}Hey, geezer, out of here!|- Come back! You're nuts!
{28894}{28950}- He wants him to become beggar|out there.
{28962}{29025}- Don't make me mad!
{29038}{29091}- I'm sick and tired of him...
{29129}{29242}I'm never going anywhere with you again!
{29591}{29714}Hey! Hey! Hey!...
{29922}{30010}What a shot!
{30039}{30075}- Bravo, boss!
{30450}{30518}Isn't it a lovely animal?
{30533}{30605}- On behalf of the Hunting Association|we confiscate your bike.
{30614}{30657}Come here!|You ride,
{30662}{30705}we'll run behind you.|- I can't
{30707}{30763}ride a bike...|- Get on and shut up!
{30791}{30856}- Jarry, we want to go home!
{31510}{31558}Wasn't your father a baker?
{31572}{31648}- He was. Before mixing the dough
{31654}{31726}he'd fire the oven with beech wood,
{31737}{31773}sweep it out
{31779}{31856}and only then place in God's gift.
{31866}{31946}But before he started mixing
{31954}{31994}the dought...
{31997}{32036}...the...
{32038}{32076}Hold my bike for me!
{32083}{32173}First Dad would look at the sky
{32188}{32233}according to the weather
{32237}{32282}he'd put in more leaven
{32285}{32368}or less.
{32375}{32442}Bread leaven is endless.
{32447}{32518}The yeast leavens the flour,
{32538}{32630}Dad left the fermenting dough|in a small trough
{32637}{32679}covered with linen.
{32689}{32758}He'd add a drop of warm water
{32761}{32807}and the leaven leavened
{32810}{32901}and grew into a hundred leaves
{32906}{32999}leaves according to need.
{33001}{33067}A miracle.
{33164}{33278}You're envious 'cause I did a reader
{33293}{33361}school kids have been using|for 10 years.
{33393}{33476}Professor Jirasek used to come here
{33479}{33573}and say that this mineral water|was the healthiest
{33575}{33616}in Central Europe.
{33626}{33738}- There's a lot of traffic,|I'll wait.
{33742}{33798}I want to take my girlfriend|to Podebrady for lunch.
{33800}{33858}- You drive a Trabant too?|- Yes,
{33869}{33923}mine's a dependable car.
{33932}{33987}I was taking a pork-feast to friends,
{33992}{34051}the soup can tipped over
{34054}{34126}I tried to save it|drove into a ditch and upturned the car
{34129}{34190}and nothing happened
{34212}{34295}except my hair was full of barley.
{34311}{34356}"- You know about cars;"
{34375}{34412}- They say I'm an expert.
{34418}{34479}One learns by one's mistakes.
{34499}{34591}Fool that I am the carton of eggs
{34612}{34648}for my friends started slipping
{34650}{34732}and to save those 20 eggs
{34741}{34823}I finally smashed all two hundred.
{34856}{34921}Then we cleaned the car all day
{34930}{35003}the yolks were drying all over
{35008}{35089}the sun was scorching and the stink
{35100}{35176}for two months that car stank
{35183}{35241}like the local mineral water.
{35262}{35329}So I can only give lifts to my chums,
{35331}{35420}any stranger would think|I'd shit my trousers.
{35529}{35621}Hey!|Wait for me, chums!
{36317}{36353}I'm thirsty.
{36430}{36465}Damn!
{37168}{37212}This is the shoulder.
{37225}{37320}This part of the pig is the leg,
{37325}{37393}from which ham is made.
{37424}{37542}These are the ribs,|the butcher makes a "pocket"...
{37642}{37668}ELEMENTARY SCHOOL|LOCAL PEOPLE'S LIBRARY
{37816}{37856}What is it, children?
{37973}{38048}...the best meat of the crusade...|Climb onto your desks!
{38488}{38534}Watch out!|- Aim at his eye!
{38537}{38569}- I know.|- Good morning.
{39257}{39345}Back to your seats, children.
{39510}{39548}May I?|- Of course.
{39598}{39648}What is it, children?|Quietly!
{39807}{39837}Sit down, children.
{40158}{40223}Mr Junek! Maestro!
{40231}{40279}My kids were fighting
{40285}{40360}and they broke the angel's bottom.
{40364}{40452}Would you mend it for me?|- I'm an academy painter, lady.
{40455}{40521}I don't mend bottoms.|- It won't kill you to mend
{40533}{40593}the angel's bottom!
{40611}{40675}- I illustrated the reader
{40676}{40730}kids have been using for 10 years.
{40733}{40810}I can't mend angels!
{40837}{40898}I want to become an Artist of Merit!
{40969}{41028}Gentlemen, as hunters I wish
{41031}{41102}you'd tell the children|about this tusker!
{41151}{41241}- Dear children, here you see
{41250}{41291}a wild boar.
{41305}{41345}The male is a hog, the female a swine.
{41352}{41408}The muzzle is called the snout.
{41416}{41475}The eyes are called "lights"
{41481}{41542}which were "extinguished"|by the fatal shot.
{41563}{41616}He is covered with bristles.
{41630}{41671}His blood is called "colour".
{41691}{41729}I must be sclerotic.
{41736}{41840}I forgot my eighth of butter.|- You're lucky I haven't closed shop.
{41850}{41882}But now we are here alone...
{41885}{41969}My daughter's getting married,|d'you have a botched-up painting?
{41972}{42008}I could give it to her.
{42047}{42091}- What botched-up painting?
{42098}{42153}- One you foozled up.
{42160}{42248}- I don't foozle up paintings, lady!
{42258}{42304}I'm an Academy Painter!
{42318}{42377}I only paint things I can paint!
{42392}{42428}I'll pay!
{42457}{42518}- I've handed in the takings...
{42530}{42565}Okay,
{42579}{42690}here's a salami that's 27.50
{42718}{42756}a bottle of rum
{42787}{42823}two packs of butter...
{42872}{42930}...a boo of matches|and that makes a hundred!
{42942}{42985}- I can paint even what I can't.
{43006}{43053}I botched-up painting?
{43080}{43121}No way!
{43887}{43924}Here they come!
{44002}{44038}Wait!
{44300}{44378}Wild boar family life is very moving.
{44401}{44503}They love each other like humans do.|- What a guy, boys!
{44506}{44606}- That head will get our hunters|first prize
{44610}{44653}at the Budapest exhibition!
{44662}{44698}- A nice day, huh?
{44700}{44768}- Hey hoo!|- Wait!
{44794}{44867}Who shot the wild boar?|- Me!
{44872}{44967}- So yours is the hunter's right,|the innards and the trophies.
{44981}{45037}The rest is ours
{45039}{45116}'cause it extinguished in our village!
{45175}{45242}- It extinguished in the school|that belongs to both villages!
{45245}{45325}- The school is common|but the hunting grounds are ours!
{45327}{45366}- Janecek shot it
{45368}{45459}and saved our children and the teacher.
{45462}{45558}- That's true,|but the law's on our side.
{45575}{45634}The hog's ours!|- Yeah!
{45729}{45816}- We were the victors we did the running
{45818}{45882}we risked our lives in the classroom!
{45900}{45990}- We suffered, and the danger!
{45995}{46041}You'd do us out of the Feast?
{46044}{46119}- It's common sense that counts|not he law!
{46125}{46201}The boar's ours!
{46210}{46258}You must admit it!
{46311}{46416}...your towering hills|with wonder fills.
{46435}{46558}Shining angels,
{46582}{46706}wondrous story
{46722}{46838}created for God's glory.
{46850}{46936}He created you, Bohemia!
{46938}{47009}- We shot him, we ran him down,|he's ours!
{47012}{47062}- The hog belongs to where its lights|extinguished.
{47067}{47123}Where?|At school.
{47125}{47168}So whose is it?|Ours!
{47377}{47413}Stop it!
{47429}{47464}Hey, stop it, you!
{47605}{47651}Shame on you...!
{47723}{47780}Fighting over a wild boar...
{47792}{47832}What an example for the children!
{47893}{48004}Now how do I explain|what peace means?
{48043}{48093}Well, well, come to your senses...
{48097}{48208}Why don't you take the boar|to neutral ground - The Lodge?
{48231}{48351}They can prepare it for you|with rose-hip sauce!
{48388}{48445}Hold the feast together!
{48489}{48531}Come to an agreement!
{48600}{48653}Isn't there enough trouble|in the world...?
{48744}{48811}Agreed?|When?
{48825}{48906}Next Saturday, not this,|- And jump!
{48910}{48963}- So the meat's tender!
{48966}{49020}- We'll halve the costs!|- Right.
{49027}{49092}- That's how conflicts should be solved.
{49100}{49135}Children!
{49148}{49271}- Beautiful Bohemia mine
{49293}{49416}you're my soul's shrine
{49431}{49533}mountains so high...|- I'd better keep an eye on them!
{49545}{49582}Wait!
{49587}{49681}- To set the seal on that
{49686}{49760}I'll make my special tripe soup!
{49910}{49961}What do I do with the salami -
{49963}{50014}with my vegetable diet?
{50019}{50080}And no fridge!
{50095}{50133}And the rum?
{50137}{50244}With my diabetes?!|And two slabs of butter?
{50247}{50313}It'll go rancid!
{50318}{50368}- Good morning, Mr Junek!
{50387}{50443}The hunters snapped off my pedal.
{50449}{50543}Isn't it a lovely day?|Like by old Monet
{50560}{50605}or painted by you.
{50614}{50665}- May I join you?
{51540}{51577}Isn't this something!
{51592}{51673}I'm proud to be a member|of the Hunting Association.
{51682}{51750}It's going to be great!
{51764}{51801}Great!
{52503}{52589}The poor wild piggy Daddy...
{52600}{52656}- Poor wild piggy Mummy, I'd say...
{52659}{52715}- Bang! Into the eye!
{52725}{52770}...waiting for Daddy to come home!
{52808}{52821}Tssss.
{52836}{52894}And the piglet babie...
{52900}{52973}They're waiting for Daddy too.
{52990}{53057}- Our Dad didn't come home|for two nights,
{53062}{53119}on the third day a taxi arrived.
{53125}{53201}- I bet you were glad to see your Daddy!
{53203}{53262}- He only sent the taxi
{53266}{53350}from the pub to fetch his trumpet!
{53405}{53441}Come on!
{53552}{53588}Watch it!
{53596}{53681}- Ouch!|- What portion...
{53685}{53720}- Just take it!
{53726}{53762}- Excellent!
{54165}{54226}As a kid I was a genius.
{54237}{54328}When our priest asked|which was the greatest Catholic holiday
{54333}{54383}I said when the pig's slaughtered.
{54400}{54452}- Must tell my old woman...
{54616}{54703}We saved the school-children!
{54708}{54813}- You stink of liquor!
{54819}{54870}You wait when we get home...!|- That is Pernod.
{54895}{54943}We were celebrating victory.
{54947}{54993}It was wonderful!
{54996}{55085}- If we've caught pneumonia, Pop,|you'll cop it!

{58437}{58463}THE GARDENERS' GIFT TO KERSKO
{59175}{59215}I know!
{61672}{61766}They're chasing the hog out of its skin!
{61778}{61823}Why don't you come?
{61853}{61938}- Pop!|Come here! Come here!
{62663}{62778}We're out of mineral water, dear.
{62798}{62881}Shall I go to the spring?|- No fear, we'll go!
{62964}{63064}- I'll get you some cigarettes.|- We've got enough for the week!
{63132}{63213}- We're all out of beer, sweetie.
{63233}{63297}Black beer's good for the blood.
{63299}{63350}- What about the sheep?!
{63352}{63398}- The pub, that's what you're after.
{63400}{63461}- Take 'em grazing!

{65308}{65398}The people in that Kingdom were|neither stupid
{65417}{65521}nor clever.|Neither cowardly nor brave.
{65540}{65633}Neither cowardly, nor brave.
{65667}{65728}But none were
{65751}{65818}truly wise.
{66072}{66108}So what, neighbour?
{66119}{66195}They're chasing the boar out|of its skin! Come and help me!
{66210}{66249}A great business deal.
{66275}{66338}I'm swapping this for the skin,
{66350}{66408}the skin for an electric motor
{66423}{66485}and that for a second-hand bike.
{66488}{66588}And the bike for a billy-boat!
{66591}{66638}- Shame on you!|- Good morning!
{66640}{66735}- I have this pressure on my chest.|I'm depressed!
{66775}{66827}- Just don't get drunk!
{66872}{66970}I hereby open the meeting|of the boar-feast committee.
{67087}{67133}Hey!
{67269}{67338}The best of the wild boar
{67344}{67453}is the rump and leg with hip sauce.
{67463}{67505}And dumplings...
{67508}{67572}- Dumplings...|- Cooked in a serviette.
{67583}{67643}- It's better with sauerkraut.
{67646}{67720}- We'll have it with hip sauce!
{67723}{67773}- With sauerkraut!|- With hip sauce!
{67777}{67825}- With sauerkraut!|- With hip sauce!
{67829}{67865}- With sauerkraut!|- With hip sauce!
{67882}{67936}- But gentlemen...
{67959}{68043}must your villages fight|whenever you meet?
{68062}{68130}The women in the fields go at each other
{68133}{68179}with their hoes.
{68201}{68248}You're like kids!
{68271}{68365}So we'll go halves. - Half with|sauerkraut, half with hip sauce.
{68836}{68958}Widdle-piddle-wee.|Widdle-piddle-wee.
{69009}{69110}Widdle-piddle-wee.|That's my song.
{69157}{69216}- And I'll make some tripe soup|for midnight!
{69245}{69296}D'you know which is my tree?
{69320}{69379}- The pine.|- No.

{69459}{69509}- The weeping willow.|- No.
{69544}{69580}- The aspen.
{69592}{69682}The first messenger of spring.
{69770}{69879}My new girl-friend, an angel.
{69932}{69973}You'll see for yourself.
{70162}{70202}Now you're staring!
{70246}{70343}I love buying lovely things cheap.
{70355}{70404}Seconds sometime,
{70407}{70483}but I can't resist a good buy...
{70664}{70737}Great, huh?|I'll give you one.
{70760}{70824}They're out of fashion|but they'll be back!
{70849}{70914}No buttons or button-holes
{70916}{70973}cause the tailor got so drunk...
{70978}{71068}But I couldn't resist it|at that price...
{71082}{71158}One waistcoat came|to six crowns fifty.
{71162}{71277}This was the best bargain.|One boot came to five crowns!
{71298}{71388}I talked them into selling.|I drowned their objections
{71390}{71466}in the flood of my will-power|and they gave in.
{71475}{71523}- Aren't they all for the left foot?
{71537}{71588}- Sure they are!
{71591}{71651}Or they wouldn't have been that cheap!
{71674}{71715}Take a pair.
{71721}{71790}They're not for running,|but to stand in at the work-bench.
{71794}{71830}Keep you warm.
{71875}{71916}Water pails, these.
{71933}{72051}They leak a bit|but these plasters were a bargain.
{72063}{72123}Here's a pail for you,
{72125}{72161}and a plaster.
{72189}{72248}They cost me 90 hellers each...!
{72272}{72320}That's... dirt cheap.
{72335}{72453}No saucers, but at fifty crowns|I couldn't resist them.
{72467}{72525}Bought the plates separately, cheap.
{72579}{72617}Let's have some music.
{72645}{72725}I bought 50 records at 1 crown each.
{72754}{72808}25 of 'em play half-way
{72825}{72915}till the end.
{73195}{73236}Isn't it a lovely tune?
{75325}{75396}I'm set for life with The Hermit
{75399}{75441}by Bedrich Nikodem.
{75534}{75625}It's my life-story.|It's my song, my life-story.
{75651}{75694}- It'll be hard for you to die.
{75697}{75761}- What'll they play
{75780}{75816}over my coffin?
{75826}{75862}- The Hermit.
{75905}{75960}By Nikodem.
{76035}{76093}Enough! Go to bed! Go home!
{76129}{76170}Can't stand that!
{76187}{76233}Drunk again?
{76237}{76288}Go and be treated!
{76404}{76458}My new girl friend.
{76470}{76515}I swapped her for a painting.
{76542}{76590}A misty winter landscape.
{78248}{78323}THE GARDENERS' GIFT TO KERSKO
{80210}{80324}We're making 30 salamis|with the wild pork.
{80326}{80394}- We bought 4 kilos of beef.
{80397}{80478}- Would you supervise?
{80489}{80538}See to the smoking?

{81012}{81107}100 of this salami, 100 of that,
{81209}{81241}I love those.
{81244}{81345}Just seeing the stuff in the shop window|makes me
{81348}{81424}go weak in the knees. I do the shopping|quickly
{81426}{81469}and rush home.
{81475}{81530}There we gobble it all up.
{81533}{81629}We watch television|and I keep reaching out
{81634}{81678}till there's nothing on the table.
{81683}{81760}"AII gone,", I say.|Let's go to bed.
{81770}{81876}At midnight I wake from hunger|and fight my conscience.
{81882}{81993}Then I say: "Oh shit!".|I get half a stick of salami
{81998}{82046}and munch it in bed.
{82053}{82134}My wife mumbles:|"Don't get the sheets greasy!"
{82137}{82183}And we go to sleep.
{82186}{82250}But I wake an hour later
{82252}{82330}and have to get up|and gorge on the rest of the salami.
{82337}{82413}That goes on till morning.|And for breakfast I have roast pork.

{82775}{82835}that she hot combs her curls...
