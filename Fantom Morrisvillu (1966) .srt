3
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,740
<i>It was a misty, dark night.</i>

4
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,612
<i>In the light drizzle, the guard of
Middlesouthborouch Stone prison...</i>

5
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,859
<i>cracked open a window</i>

6
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,372
<i>and bid his sight in vain</i>

7
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,772
<i>to penetrate the
impenetrable fog.</i>

8
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,692
<i>-You wouldn't let a dog out in this weather.
-He mumbled and closed the window again.</i>

9
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,452
<i>Out of the shadow of the prison wall,
two figures appeared.</i>

10
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,614
<i>The bigger of the two, Dixi, called Stick,
pulled a short pistol out of his pocket.</i>

11
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,054
<i>-What is it?
-Asked the smaller one,</i>

12
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,820
<i>called Rosie.</i>

13
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,449
If it's anybody but Micky,
I'll bring him down without hesitation.

14
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,818
<i>One could hear light footsteps.</i>

15
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,133
<i>The third gang member, Micky,
alias Chicken, was coming.</i>

16
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,696
-All right?
-The weather will pass.

17
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,180
If something unexpected doesn't come up,

18
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,140
Manuel Diaz will be freed tonight.

19
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,415
-Let's go.
-You talk too much.

20
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,778
Before the boss is free, I'm in charge.
Let's get to work!

21
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,659
Thread.

22
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,259
String.

23
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,899
Rope.

24
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:31,740


25
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,420
<i>Few men succumb to sleep,
when their life is at stake.</i>

26
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,856
<i>Only one could fall asleep
on Death Row.</i>

27
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,490
Your last wish, prisoner.

28
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,298
-I wanted a banjo and a manicure set.
-The prison head forbid it.

29
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,053
It contained a file.

30
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,099
Pliers, saw.

31
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,738
O.K. Coil it up.

32
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,531


33
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,495
<i>Second, wait,

34
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,534
<i>-Unharness time and wait a moment
-Third window on the left, not the fourth.</i>

35
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,094
<i>And let it come back</i>

36
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,655
<i>Let her be happy with me</i>

37
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,215
<i>My darling, who I like</i>

38
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,130
<i>Let my flag be in rags</i>

39
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,737
<i>Let tomorrow be lost in darkness</i>

40
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,936
<i>Let the Devil himself
hold me in his clutches</i>

41
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,810
<i>I don't know, the work fear</i>

42
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,217
<i>When it has to be</i>

43
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,976
<i>Let the punishment come</i>

44
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,376
<i>I'll bear it as a man</i>

45
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,412
<i>Let the executioner come</i>

46
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,856
<i>Let the black wall come</i>

47
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,697
<i>I'll be laughing</i>

48
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,336
<i>Please now,</i>

49
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,016
<i>Second, wait my star, my glow</i>

50
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,617
<i>Just no hurry</i>

51
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,297
<i>Just wait a moment</i>

52
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:31,730
<i>I'm missing
that light</i>

53
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,378
<i>You know, the one I like</i>

54
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,729
<i>The one I like</i>

55
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,738
<i>-The one I like</i>

00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,940


57
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,135
<i>One day when it suits</i>

58
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,655
<i>And I'll be a big lord</i>

59
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,215
<i>I want to leave on a big ship</i>

60
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,411
<i>Across the blue ocean</i>

61
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,812
<i>No one there will know</i>

62
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,530
<i>That I escaped from prison</i>

63
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,139
<i>I could hang out at the bar
like the Perian sheikh</i>

64
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,257
<i>Ho, ho, ho</i>

65
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,811
<i>Ho and ho and ho</i>

66
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,690
<i>While I can sing yipee yey</i>

67
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,250
<i>I can live anywhere fine</i>

68
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,611
<i>Ho, ho, ho</i>

69
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,176
<i>Ho and ho and ho</i>

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,169
<i>When I lose everying yipee yo</i>

71
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,690
<i>Let the devils take me away</i>

72
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,853
I understand why they call him
''singing Manuel''.

73
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,900
He won't be quiet until the morning.

74
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,894
-You don't love singing, jail keeper?
-On the contrary, I like listening to it.

75
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,260


76
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,852
<i>And I'll be having fun</i>

77
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,375
<i>I want whisky in a barrel</i>

78
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,452
<i>And a leather jacket</i>

79
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,728
<i>And I'll go, yoho</i>

80
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,618
<i>Sleeping with the Sheriff's wife</i>

81
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,296
<i>Ho, ho, ho</i>

82
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,891
<i>Ho and hou and hou</i>

83
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,850
<i>While I can sing yipee yey</i>

84
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,410
<i>I can live well anywhere</i>

85
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,136
-He's a great singer.
-Yes, Father.

86
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,219
And an even greater crook.

87
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:23,820


88
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,780
<i>From the luxurious study of M.C.
Pellham, the press magnate</i>

89
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,613
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,
came this announcement:</i>

90
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:36,138
<i>Allan Pinkerton calls M.C.
M.C. calls Allan Pinkerton.</i>

91
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,777
Allan Pinkerton calls M.C.
M.C. calls Allan Pinkerton.

92
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,175
One moment, madam.
Tea? Whisky?

93
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,140
My dear Pinkertone, tonight at midnight
there will be a wedding at Morrisville

94
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,820
between Sir Hanibal Morris,
and Clarence Hamilton.

95
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,740
You'll attend as a representative of our newspaper.

96
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,651
It'll be a pleasure.

97
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,568
Thank you, sir.

98
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,180
Do you know Alan?
Who is the lady?

99
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,180
My mysterious benefactor.

100
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,700
During my studies at Oxford,
she always appeared at Christmas.

101
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,296
She had me called to the dean's office,
and there she kissed me on the forehead.

102
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,180
Then she disappeared again.

103
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,220
-How did you come to her?
-She came to me, with an unreasonable request.

104
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,820
I told her that I won't send my
best criminal reported to the wedding.

105
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:04,500
But she came up with 51% of the shares of
our newspaper, so I couldn't say no.

106
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,420
-I wouldn't want to refuse a lady something.
-I understand.

107
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,140
Sir Morris is entitled do such an honor.

108
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,900
We studied together, served in India at one regiment.

109
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,660
I was there when he proposed to his first love.

110
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,580
-I didn't know he had been married.
-Engaged, dear boy.

111
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,017
I was called off, when he introduced his
fiancee to his family.

112
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,940
-Financial reasons?
-Oh no. Social ones.

113
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,649
Poor Hanibal fell in love with Miss Arabella.

114
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,820
-Pardon me.
-What Sarah Bernhard was on stage,

115
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,450
was Miss Arabella in the circus.

116
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,740
She enjoyed great successes in both hemispheres.

117
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,129
-The whole world knew her.
-Tamer?

118
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,012
-Show rider.
-I understand.

119
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,620
That wasn't the worst of it.

120
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,418
Old lady Morris liked horses too.

121
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,980
Tea please.

122
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,019
When she found out that Arabella's
mother is a hairy lady

123
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,700
and father is a clown

124
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,380
she refused to accept a daughter of
such socially unacceptable people.

125
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,214
There is something in that story that
somehow excites me.

126
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,780
-What happened next, did they break up?
-Actually yes.

127
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,260
She disappeared without a good-bye.

128
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,820
-And Sir Hanibal?
-He was angry.

129
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,209
After some time he got a letter. Not a love
letter, but entirely impersonal.

130
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,652
It said that Arabella would like to use
the first opportunity to tell him

131
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,740
that he is the father of a child that
he will never see.

132
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,493
Signature, dot, and that's it.

133
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,538
Poor Sir Hanibal.

134
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,899
Go there and make at least a column

135
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,932
out of Hanibal's naivety
for our Sunday paper.

136
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,334
Yes, sir.

137
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,457
A propos, Allan,
can you fly a plane?

138
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,819
-A little bit.
-Then that means something.

139
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,609
You'll take my personal biplane.
Good luck.

140
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,488
Hello?

141
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,540
<i>Allan's manly,
chisel-sculpted face,</i>

142
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,772
<i>is a sportsman's face,
which has only one belief.</i>

143
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,298
<i>Belief in himself.</i>

144
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,660
<i>There's something of a falcon in his eyes,</i>

145
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,131
<i>but on the bottom of those two
steel grey wells</i>

146
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,578
<i>await the waggery warm
sparks for the one,</i>

147
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,415
<i>who Allan Pinkerton
hasn't met yet.</i>

148
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:47,497


149
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,540
<i>The glorious notes of the organ
in the Morrisville chapel</i>

150
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,780
<i>rang solemnly
into the velvet night.</i>

151
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:10,100


152
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,330
Sir Hanibal Morris,

153
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,417
do you take Clarence Hamilton
as your lawful wedded wife?

154
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,013
Yes.

155
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,609
And you Clerence Hamilton,

156
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,692
do you take Sir Hannibal Morris
as you lawful wedded husband?

157
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,574
Yes.

158
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,691
From this moment you'll go
a together to eternity.

159
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,899
Heartiest congratulations.

160
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,654
Rose.

161
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,453
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

162
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,658


163
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,255
<i>Second, stop,
although you are not exactly beautiful</i>

164
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,455
<i>unharness time
and stay a while</i>

165
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,452
<i>And let her return</i>

166
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,699
<i>Let her be happy with me</i>

167
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,174
<i>My dear, who I love</i>

168
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:53,254


169
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:13,335


170
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,739
Hello, Brumpby.
Old, brisk Scotland Yard slave.

171
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,289
How is it that you are always there,
when something happens?

172
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,419
How is it that you look like
a policeman, even at a wedding?

173
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,976
So far, it resembles a funeral.

174
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,580
Advise me Brumpby where can I
get myself a bit civilized?

175
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,500
Miss Mabel, this is my personal
enemy, Allan Pinkerton.

176
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,380
Journalists say
that he should be a detective.

177
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,980
He could be a good journalist,

178
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,660
if he didn't worry about
Scotland Yard matters.

179
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,980
Look after him and disregard
his appearance.

180
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,980
In reality he looks worse.

181
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,891
Sir Hannibal's secretary.

182
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,854
Excuse me, please.

183
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,533
Thank you, Brumpby.

184
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,850
-Where am I?
-In your bedroom, my dear,

185
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,459
by your husband.

186
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,294
Forgive me, Hannibal,
that I fainted.

187
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,696
-I was upset.
-Don't worry, darling.

188
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,857
-Do you feel better?
-I'm fine now.

189
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,816
-something serious, Doctor?
-Normal wedding fainting.

190
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:38,413
Could my wife attend the ancient ceremony then?

191
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,052
In exactly 8 minutes she will be fine.

192
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,050
Otherwise however, she'll be sick for
2 to 3 weeks.

193
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,774
-Why are you giving me this?
-I'm not giving, I'm returning.

194
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:17,328
-Oh I see.
-But then I could think that you sent me this.

195
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,300
<i>If you value your life, leave!</i>

196
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,850
-Which one is yours?
-Choose.

197
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,653
What will you do, Brumpby?

198
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,690
Look, I'm already old,
and for a few years

199
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,698
I will not spoil my character.
How about you?

200
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,219
I'll stay, too.

201
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,372


202
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,496
-My god, Manuel, you're alive?
-I'm alive. And how.

203
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,250
-Don't forget that I am the wife of another.
-I do not forget.

204
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,376
But you have a short memory.

205
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:30,300


206
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,576
<i>When night falls and smells of violets</i>

207
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,737
<i>The moon unfolds nets in the pool</i>

208
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,137
<i>Nothing in the world burns more acutely</i>

209
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,697
<i>Than loneliness</i>

210
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,256
<i>When my dust
taints the stars of heavens</i>

211
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,213
<i>A nightingale knocks in quiet bushes</i>

212
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,208
<i>All I think about is you,
my dearest</i>

213
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,333
<i>It saddens me to have empty arms</i>

214
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,898
<i>I have empty arms</i>

215
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,499
<i>Like a poor man's palm</i>

216
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,538
<i>So bleak as an empty house</i>

217
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,458
<i>So I roam the world</i>

218
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,458
<i>And I pay tax to Love</i>

219
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,171
<i>For which I'll once lose my mind</i>

220
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,133
<i>I have empty arms
like a deaf flower</i>

221
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,093
<i>and bleak as a dry savanna</i>

222
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,133
<i>I sing softly</i>

223
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,856
<i>And I can only envy</i>

224
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,052
<i>Covers, which count your heartbeat</i>

225
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,217
<i>I would like to take you to who knows where</i>

226
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,137
<i>To a dew-strewn meadow in the spring</i>

227
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,615
<i>I hope I'll succeed one day</i>

228
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,539
<i>But now I have empty arms</i>

229
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,493
<i>My arms are desolate</i>

230
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,732
<i>Like a sea plain</i>

231
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,178
<i>As empty as blind eyes</i>

232
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,291
<i>I sing softly</i>

233
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,855
<i>And I pay taxes to Love</i>

234
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,929
<i>And the whole world is shipwreck</i>

235
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,898
<i>shipwreck, stranded wreck</i>

236
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,499
Here, give it to me!

237
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,694
You came too late.

238
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,332
Given where I'm coming from and how
they treated me there

239
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,536
I'm coming just in time.

240
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,212
-You escaped from prison.
-From Death Row even, darling.

241
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,940
-What If I call the police?
-You do not need a phone for that.

242
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,728
That old dick Brumpby,
is sitting downstairs. Call him.

243
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,054
And we'll see what the law and Sir Morris
say, when I show them this.

244
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,132
Mercy. Don't ruin me.
Leave.

245
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,812
Leave from my life.

246
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,700
-My wedding gift will be your compensation.
-Don't tug it.

247
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,056
Or you'll damage the clip of
Morrisville emeralds.

248
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,413
So what next?

249
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,339
-I could send you money.
-How much?

250
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,930
So you can live a carefree life.

251
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,890
-You couldn't get that much.
-I'm not saying now. But in time.

252
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,377
Hanibal made me the universal
heir of his vast fortune.

253
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,974
Now we're talking, girlie.

254
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,894
I would be foolish fool, if I
I was content with a bit,

255
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,210
when I can have everything.

256
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,214
How so?

257
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,010
If you belong to me, then so does
everything that's yours.

258
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,339
But it will be mine only
after Hanibal's death.

259
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,094
-I do not want to think about that.
-You don't have to.

260
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,290
-I'll take care of it.

261
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,009
Excuse me?
I'd like to introduce you to

262
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,092
an old Morrisvillian ceremony.

263
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,536
Take this cup, which you'll hand to Sir Hannibal.

264
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,975
This man, Sir Elvud Georg Morris,
got married at the beginning of the 17th century.

265
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,455
His rival in love, Commodore
Campbell Patney, decided

266
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,615
that with the help of bribed servants
he would poison Sir Elvuda.

267
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,894
Fortunately Sir Elvud's favorite hunting dog

268
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:57,572
jumped into his master's lap and overturned
the poisoned cup.

269
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,851
His master ordered him to lick up the
spilled wine.

270
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:08,015
He licked once, twice,
and after the third lick dropped dead.

271
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,740
-What was the name of the dog?
-Bahadur.

272
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,971
He was posthumously promoted
to the peerage.

273
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,695
To avoid a similar case repeating,

274
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,818
we have a habit in our family since 1608

275
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,333
that the wedding cup, which
the bride hands her husband

276
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,978
is first tasted by the dog,
Bahad's descendant,

277
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,735
and then his master drinks.

278
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,052
Followed by a normal
wedding festivities.

279
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,375
-To your health.
-To yours.

280
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,698
<i>Barely did Clarence appear ...</i>

281
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,015
<i>Barely did Clarence appear ...</i>

282
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,054
<i>Barely did Clarence appear,</i>

283
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,409
<i>there was whispering in the choir,
how beautiful she was.</i>

284
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,492
How beautiful.

285
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,539
How beautiful.

286
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,492
How beautiful.

287
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,579
Seven.

288
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,419
Seven.

289
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,931
Indeed lucky number.

290
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,654
Do you know who was born on 7 July?

291
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,733
-La Fontaine.
-Also. And who else?

292
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,854
Wait. R. B. Sherriden.

293
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,614
And then?

294
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,053
Well, me.

295
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,933
Call Berry.

296
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,099
fifty-seventh Earl Berry of Bahadur.

297
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,217
The dog instinctively sensed that
the wine was poisoned.

298
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,097
Do not touch, hands off!

299
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,612
It's a police matter.

300
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,695
Get a box; we must send it off for analysis.

301
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,934
Analysis can be done on site.
Is the laboratory open?

302
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,333
We would need to
bring one more witness.

303
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,418
-There's one.
-Please.

304
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,371
-I am innocent.
-No one suspects you, dear.

305
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,698
Still, I'd like to talk with you
alone.

306
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,209
Come with me, please, to the terrace.

307
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,412
-The devil! That's a bit much!

308
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,615
Caliber 45 mm pistols of Belgian production
with a long barrel.

309
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,899
Do you think that bullet was meant for me?

310
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,800
I don't want to jump to conclusions, but...

311
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,819
-someone here is striving for your life.
-But who?

312
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,540
-You always write things down?
-Recently yes.

313
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,452
There are moments
when I forget the whole world.

314
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,574
Now we'll see,
if your hypothesis is correct.

315
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,455
This, please, mix it with the wine.
Here.

316
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,854
Not yet, please.
I'll tell you.

317
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,296
-Now!

318
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,579
Congratulations, Inspector there was
strong poison in that wine.

319
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,538
Very strong.

320
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,380
Reputation, Pinkerton, wrongs the tigers.

321
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,168
They are not nearly as bloodthirsty
as human beasts.

322
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:41,215
-What about that up there?
-Beasts are also among the animals.

323
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,975
-The one inside it was a friend of yours?
-No, a cook.

324
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,900
-That touches a man.
-Of course.

325
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,940
You can not imagine, what woodcock on wine
he used to cook.

326
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,693
-Where was I?
-At human beasts.

327
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,540
<i>As if by magic
a gun appeared in Allan's hand.</i>

328
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,531
<i>The bullet jammed in the barrel.</i>

329
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,095
What's going on?
Did somebody shoot?

330
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,659
Sir...

331
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,659
I wanted to, but I didn't shoot.
What if it was a lady?

332
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,978
We can consider it certain,
that the offender...

333
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,855
We can not exclude,
that the crime was committed by a woman.

334
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:35,055
That the perpetrator took a spear from the
other room

335
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,895
and tried to kill your Lordship with it.

336
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:44,335
After an unsuccessful attempt he fled the scene,
or escaped through the window.

337
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,137
Thus, the perpetrators must be sought
in the garden,

338
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:53,370
and due to the speed at which he moved,
also outside the garden.

339
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,775
-Well, and if we exclude the other ...
-Your procedure, Inspector

340
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,180
although strictly logical,
it won't get you very far.

341
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,500
If you exclude all thos who could not have
committed the crime,

342
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,209
you'll conclude that it could have been
commited by anyone else.

343
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,212
-Do you know a better method?
-Certainly.

344
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,138
I know that the crime could not
have been committed by a woman.

345
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,252
