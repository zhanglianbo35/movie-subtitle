1
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,390
<i>If the land had force to back.</i>

2
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,910
<i>All areas associated with gold</i>

3
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,020
<i>Who died in expeditions stranded on
the continent.</i>

4
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,330
<i>All they had been through, these
years.</i>

5
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,970
<i>Not because of money, because they
know what they mean money.</i>

6
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,330
<i>During the territory.</i>

7
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,550
<i>Not because of its debt as current
debt in the nature of man</i>

8
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,380
<i>Rather than verbal formulation.
Not for the glory.</i>

9
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,570
<i>But because of what the unknown, in
the name of which conceives and
runs.</i>

10
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,610
<i>Individual human life.</i>

11
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,720
<i>City.
Mainly geological management of
north-construction.</i>

12
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,870
<i>5902 km from Moscow.</i>

13
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,380
For the last three years the
extraction of gold from river fell
sharply.

14
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,260
<i>In 1958 we brought down the yield of
500 kg.</i>

15
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,620
And last year lost a ton and a half
of gold.

16
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,920
New reserves are not found, growth
stocks of gold-negligible.

17
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,750
And if that continues, will fly
heads and first mine

18
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,620
And all you waiting despondent and
happy retirement.

19
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,360
We have a plan to optimize all
expenses except the cost of gold.

20
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,230
For example, territory, Comrade
Finches.

21
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,570
About what we lead the territory?

22
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,370
Case.
- In fact, gold mining.

23
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,810
He will write gergusheva companion,
journalist from Leningrad.

24
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,220
So.

25
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,270
I stopped what?
- What is our lead-complex.

26
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,620
Indeed, what we lead the territory?

27
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,520
Available there to close geological
management.

28
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,530
For him I do not care.
Territory is one of the seven
departments.

29
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,190
We can stop it.
More that it's lead-mining province.

30
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,090
And no one here believes
gold-territory.

31
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,140
In ideas you can believe or not
believe.

32
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,150
And gold, commodity-material
entirely.

33
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,970
We know of the existence of gold, we
can not know

34
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,010
But we unfortunately do not know
anything there gold complex or not.

35
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,420
<i>Finches not heard more.
He remembered the smell of cedar
slannik,</i>

36
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,000
<i>Forgotten smoke fires and victorious
faith in happiness.</i>

37
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,030
<i>They thought that was the end of
finches, and he even never started.</i>

38
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,520
<i>Now is the time.
-time.</i>

39
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,390
Will not give you the territory.

40
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,180
Ilya Nikolayevich,

41
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,290
I want to write about-gold complex.

42
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,050
I am happy, but you just heard, that
it does not exist,

43
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,660
And you can not have it.

44
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,930
I will write about gold complex.

45
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,390
<i>Nobody and never seen gold really
comes from territory.</i>

46
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,890
<i>T is p and t p o her.</i>

47
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,560
<i>Settlement.
Headquarters complex geological
controls.</i>

48
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,660
<i>1410 km from the city.</i>

49
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,860
Here such summer upon us this year.

50
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,940
And to the south in the mountains
larch blossomed already.

51
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,070
<i>Henry furdetski was appointed Head
of the complex.</i>

52
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,220
<i>Only a month ago.</i>

53
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,330
<i>The tops of severstroy thought if
furdetski is vanity,</i>

54
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,990
<i>Then at Finches management of the
population will die down.</i>

55
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,250
<i>And in case that person is then
useful to own.</i>

56
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,390
<i>Opposition of finches.</i>

57
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,700
I hear you, Ilia Nikolaevich.
- Stay.

58
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,280
Now inform you, right?
And so I remain in the government,

59
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,780
It means that we will work together.

60
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,810
I'm glad.
- If you bother me, I will destroy.

61
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,170
In your interest to go to my team.

62
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,800
What do you want?
- Little.

63
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,680
Not playing behind me.
All messages town after
consultation.

64
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,720
For me remains the implementation of
production tasks,

65
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,510
We guarantee their.
Plus business part, housing supply.

66
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,780
Basically, everything in the
statute.

67
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,460
I advise you not to think, but
directly to agree.

68
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,440
Darmed.

69
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,260
And what is the phenomenon?

70
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,980
I walked into the dorm, the girls
already two months tundra.

71
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,130
Ice corners not yet melted.

72
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,600
Not boys, and geologists.

73
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,280
And this will be the concern of
chief management furdetski.

74
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,450
Of course!
Where you have a great care.
Projects!

75
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,210
Laureates and banquets.

76
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,610
Come fall, will return the boys

77
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,120
I would choose for himself chairman
of the union,

78
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,900
And I will announce to you padishasi
war.

79
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,500
I thought his rusty fool, nothing to
surprise me.

80
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,560
Kutsenko tell that tomorrow we go in
mongolov.

81
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,220
Rejoice, as you see there.

82
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,570
<i>Ilya Nikolayevich Minkov, nicknamed
Buddha</i>

83
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,280
<i>He ended up in the river, as a young
engineer.</i>

84
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,590
<i>Right there Finches created the
foundations of the coming legend</i>

85
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,860
<i>Where ruthlessness to themselves and
to others, was multiplied luck.</i>

86
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,340
<i>His expedition discovered the
largest gold mines in the country.</i>

87
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,760
<i>But before six months, unexpectedly
passed the leadership of severstroy
report.</i>

88
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,480
<i>Finches asked to shift in geological
supernumerary management.</i>

89
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,500
<i>Complex on the banks of the icy
ocean.</i>

90
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,930
<i>River Valley Elga.
Eastern investigative Party.</i>

91
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
270 km.
Population.

92
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,810
I wish health, Comrade Chief.
- How to you?

93
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,140
Nothing in this hole except my
salary.

94
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,200
Where do you stand?
- To eighth m.

95
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,930
My little pierced.
Morning wash them.

96
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,920
Comrade mongolov, based nearing
two-outer.

97
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,730
Go insulting and in their packs have
alcohol.

98
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,760
I do not see.
- Comrade commander

99
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:42,210
We will drink a cup-and-danced.
Indian dance, called Ganga.

100
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,260
How your child?

101
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,060
All washed samples, carry the base
to 12.

102
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,920
A, Head, samples will have them.

103
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,780
Vladimir Mikhailovich!

104
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,460
I'll bring everything.

105
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,600
Hello, Ilya Nikolayevich.
- Hello, Vladimir Mikhailovich.

106
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,100
Meet, climate Chizhov kutsenko.

107
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,130
Best dishwasher in severstroy.

108
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,510
Appliances our kutsenko, tea and
fish soup.

109
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,830
Vladimir Mikhailovich

110
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,190
Could you believe for industrial
gold complex?

111
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,190
I do not believe in industrial gold
here.

112
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,540
Trite nonsense and manipulation.

113
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,870
<i>Lunch!</i>

114
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,440
<i>Comrades geologists come to lunch!</i>

115
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,580
And trousers should not put, right?

116
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,240
Will excuse me, there is only one
bottle, so.

117
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,770
I hope for your deep-alcoholic
decency.

118
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,670
Nobility come.
I saw them.

119
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,240
And what now, Vladimir Mikhailovich?

120
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,750
Do not you think it necessary to
perform search-top.

121
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,690
Check-gold.

122
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,130
See both flow.

123
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:25,850
I do not think.
Party has an approved project for
lead. There is no gold.

124
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,300
The here amount of gold we find and
around Moscow.

125
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,240
Lead-mining province.

126
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,110
And gold and lead are incompatible,
even if students know.

127
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,190
But still I am not a student.
I Finches.

128
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,410
Painted tool used in vain.

129
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,270
Worse withstand sample.
- Yes, really painted.

130
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,990
And how you
- and when completed,

131
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,020
Not water it in the corner and
rotate it through panels.

132
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,090
Yes, I pour it in the corner.
So like.

133
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,810
Not them golden sand.

134
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,080
And I think we should have them
here.

135
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,580
3 years ago, my old friend mouse
Kinski led the group of a river.

136
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,900
A devil threw him into the pits
three samples with gold

137
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,430
Mouse wrote a report about the
group's reorientation towards gold.

138
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,200
Then, he never found gold.
Then ruined it.

139
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,220
Nice soup.

140
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,980
And where are your people?
- Baklakov should return today.

141
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:06,020
The group then went to the foreman
Salakhov in multi-day route.

142
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:13,810
They will actually return in region
of Latin, if you're interested.

143
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,870
I just want to figure out where
disappeared siderite.

144
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,490
East of our area of the river wool
p,

145
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,100
For it we do not know anything.
- In relation to this,

146
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,030
Do not you want to go behind the
river wool p?
For example, for ten days,

147
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,910
Send intelligence baklakov.
- For passing boats need.

148
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,730
And the expedition should go
whole-group.

149
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,640
Then to well-lived.

150
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,840
I was a machine, border guards gave
it to me.

151
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,060
And a mare named fondle.

152
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,330
Was nice mare.

153
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,250
Only that can not wash.

154
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,040
Are ye baklakov?
- I am.

155
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,240
What do you think about individual
route for 15-20 days?

156
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,490
We can do it.
Normal.

157
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,790
It is not possible to do normal.

158
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,290
The route goes on granite masses.
You will have to take a lot-samples.

159
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,260
River wool p, and then in katunsko
nagorie.

160
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,400
To 500-600 km.

161
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,560
I will do.
- How do you plan to cross the river
wool p?

162
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,220
I do not know, you should see.

163
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,170
Yes, yes, judging by everything,
this route is all you need.

164
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,670
Go to go to bed.

165
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,140
Comrade mongolov we will make a
decision.

166
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,150
Vladimir Mikhailovich!

167
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,050
I want to talk.
- Fir.

168
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,400
Vladimir Mikhailovich, I agree with
your decision.

169
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,370
Send baklakov in multi-day
expedition.

170
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,140
Right decision.

171
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,980
Seryoga, get map.

172
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,860
<i>Drawer.
Under the table.</i>

173
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,940
Red.

174
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:06,500
What is this circus?
- I worried that would-mind.

175
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,400
And they decided to put before the
fact.

176
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,710
Could just take advantage of the
order.

177
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,160
Then I would take responsibility and
management now they do not need.

178
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,060
Accidents associated with my name.

179
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,510
Afraid of responsibility?
- Do so, Vladimir Mikhailovich.

180
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,510
Look, surrounds us severstroy.

181
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,940
And people like me, they do not
condemn.
I'm buddha.

182
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,870
What you that route, Elijah?

183
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,720
Hold.

184
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,500
Where from?
- Washed up on the river you.

185
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,580
Kutsenko has a rare talent.

186
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,190
This sense, Vladimir Mikhailovich

187
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,920
That in your pits must have gold.

188
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,930
For their washers bet.

189
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,140
Check.
You are right.

190
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,240
<i>Salakhov worked at Katyn two
seasons.</i>

191
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,870
<i>Katyn just did it-washer.</i>

192
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,580
<i>Source of the river.
Cerro. The old base of the Katyn.</i>

193
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,780
<i>Three years ago here Salakhov
washed-known samples.</i>

194
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,220
<i>Gold samorodki Katyn.</i>

195
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,130
<i>These samorodki broke the fate of
Katyn.</i>

196
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,900
<i>Salakhov felt guilt about.</i>

197
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,760
Why stand on rusty place?

198
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,440
Blank-here.

199
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,430
These are the latest samples.

200
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,130
As do-go.

201
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,580
Suffer a little, the fire god.

202
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,950
But what I I stand.

203
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,510
A cold-bit only.
You will draw?

204
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,800
<i>The upper part of the river.
Elga. 67 km. Base of mongolov.</i>

205
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,900
This place given him noticed.
As we walked to the base.

206
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,880
This is my personal request,
caraway-Chizhov.

207
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,310
I understand.

208
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,480
Mee until you run out of water.
To-last.

209
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,680
Then goes to the cheek mongolov.
There'll wait.

210
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,570
I get you, I will personally come.

211
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,290
Just do not tell anyone.

212
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,920
<i>Heart just counted its sixty beats
per minute.</i>

213
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,120
<i>Blood evenly and powerful run-veins.</i>

214
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:16,200
<i>About him already formed that
special coziness everywhere with
bum-.</i>

215
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:23,010
<i>Tundra is beautiful with its
multicolor, dark mountains, and
sky-faded.</i>

216
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:28,400
<i>Great loneliness of middle scout
unknown valleys and mountains.</i>

217
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,710
<i>It is wonderful that will never die.</i>

218
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,680
<i>And in that it is immortal, he
maklakov not doubted for a moment.</i>

219
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,960
<i>There are no restrictions and no
limits.</i>

220
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,240
<i>Run normal-eternal life.</i>

221
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,710
<i>Serrano River, 92 km.
Base of mongolov.</i>

222
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,970
<i>For the first time in my life
kutsenko performed not order</i>

223
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,370
<i>And the personal request of finches.
So we try very.</i>

224
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,810
<i>Fate he met with Chirkov after the
war.</i>

225
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,820
<i>Three years Finches him mercilessly
trained.</i>

226
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,480
<i>Forced before rinsing know there
gold here or.</i>

227
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,010
<i>But also kutsenko began to like the
work</i>

228
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,690
<i>Not separated from the rain washing
dreamed rivers, sandbanks</i>

229
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,110
<i>Processed materials, and
shale-brushes.</i>

230
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:54,090
<i>Luck shone upon him when he did
control route influx hope.</i>

231
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,850
<i>Other prospectors recognized this
influx empty.</i>

232
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:02,780
<i>Kutsenko remained inflows more than
double the normal, and discovered
gold.</i>

233
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:07,530
<i>With lev hand Finches, he has been
with caraway Chizhov.</i>

234
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,550
<i>Now if there was a glass of alcohol.</i>

235
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,080
<i>And a piece of venison.</i>

236
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,760
Because of this spirit itself cut
off.

237
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,850
I now live with a promise.

238
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,250
Treating you?

239
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,290
No, I gave.

240
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,030
After my wife died

241
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,710
Then finished.

242
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,700
Will begin again?

243
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,190
Not.

244
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,440
Children should look.

245
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,800
I have two.

246
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,160
Mouse and tosya.

247
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,860
I took them longer than orphanage.
Live with my sister.

248
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,720
All the money they send them.

249
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:25,600
Write me: Dad, come already.

250
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,440
Ilya Nikolayevich was right,

251
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:31,170
Country of great opportunities.

252
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,860
<i>Will not give you territory.</i>

253
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,870
<i>River vatapá.
98 km. Base of mongolov.</i>

254
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,040
<i>The confluence of the Danube River
in Cerro Elga.
57 km. Base of mongolov.</i>

255
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,990
<i>The fire god tormented by the
imperfection of his life.</i>

256
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,430
<i>He had no son and daughter tosya
mouse.</i>

257
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,840
<i>And she has never been married god
of fire.</i>

258
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:46,420
<i>But the dream of life, under all
normal people was so great</i>

259
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,800
<i>That he confused with reality.</i>

260
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,450
Why there are so many people who.

261
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,000
Want to live,

262
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,210
But failed.

263
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,540
<i>Camp shepherd kyae.
Somewhere territory.</i>

264
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,230
<i>Long years of life, past kyae have
passed many people.</i>

265
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:12,250
<i>He liked to think about them, what
they say words.</i>

266
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,390
<i>Some people smelled of sweat.
Of what seemed</i>

267
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,820
<i>Even their thoughts smell of work.
He respect them.</i>

268
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,770
<i>Others smelled of money.
Kyae them regret.</i>

269
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,780
<i>He was angry when life saying good
or bad.</i>

270
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,000
<i>He just has a different.</i>

271
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,070
<i>It is ridiculous to think that money
can improve it.</i>

272
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:39,780
<i>In memory of which is kept aromas of
herbs, ice, spring snow</i>

273
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,560
<i>Fields of icy cold raven and his
guttural cry over land.</i>

274
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:49,040
<i>Fall from hit with rifle wolf, the
taste of venison.</i>

275
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,780
<i>And more memory kyae kept daily and
hourly sad recognition.</i>

276
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,320
<i>Of inevitable change of snow, rain
and lives.</i>

277
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,560
<i>More than anything kyae boggles of
the irreversibility of change.</i>

278
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,840
<i>Impossible to stop it.</i>

279
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,680
Mikhalich.
- How are the samples?

280
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,960
Chief engineer was here.

281
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,990
He showed me the gold that was found
in the upper part of the river us.

282
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,220
At Katyn same thing happened.
- Five days of his old washed-base.

283
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,210
Nothing.
Our gold, our lead.

284
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,910
Finches sure

285
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,490
We must have gold.

286
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,120
What's wrong?

287
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,420
What's wrong?
Say straight.

288
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,810
When he arrived finches,

289
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,670
In the seventh sample went 3-gold
plates.

290
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:32,100
Honestly, I do not know how it
slipped gold in his pocket.
I thought mine,

291
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,330
To put it in an envelope and send it
to Sonia.

292
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,560
Sonia we studied together in school.

293
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,250
Then I became a circus school.
I thought to impress.

294
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,270
And she tells me: you also become a
waiter.

295
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,530
She liked the characters of Jack
London.

296
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,010
Why I'm here.

297
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,190
Immediately I wrote her a letter of
gold that work with urea and pelvis.

298
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,110
And suddenly she began to write me
long letters.

299
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:06,370
Misfortune stuck for that gold in
his pocket, just before you come.

300
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,730
But to back it was too late.

301
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,740
Generally Sedona called me scum.
Because.

302
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,400
Plates and threw it in the river.

303
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,810
Ashamed.

304
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
Bogatashcheta,

305
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,450
Samorodkite they will throw into the
river.

306
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,190
Motherfuckers.

307
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,540
Is your gold?

308
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,390
That gold is the state.

309
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
Criminals.

310
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,200
I am ready to bear the punishment.

311
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,210
What?
You condemn? To ruin your life?

312
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,730
Well.

313
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,280
We know we only.
- No need complicity.

314
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,500
It turns out that it's complicity in
the crime.

315
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,580
Go away!

316
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,570
You will cover his work.

317
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,660
Tamara.

318
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,370
I heard the shot?

319
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,600
I do not know.

320
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,920
Maybe.

321
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:03,780
That shot came from distant
hills-time.

322
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,500
And built many years ago.

323
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,420
And now returned.

324
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,240
Or come from the future.

325
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,630
Maybe so.

326
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,520
<i>The next morning mongolov walked in
the valleys of the river Elga.</i>

327
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,330
<i>It was confirmation of all searchers
famous thesis:</i>

328
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,900
<i>When the area is empty, we have to
work three times more</i>

329
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,920
<i>To prove that it really is-empty.</i>

330
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,250
<i>Birthplace of mercury accidentally
stumbled.</i>

331
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,820
<i>Mercury nobody thought and did not
expect.</i>

332
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:54,860
<i>Mongolov found mercury deposits of
global significance.</i>

333
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,750
Does anyone live here?

334
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:42,410
I-geologist.
Is sick.

335
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:46,320
Geologist Do?
Well.

336
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:50,810
I am a shepherd.
I know you're sick.

337
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,180
I heard a shot.
Look
- tent.

338
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:02,200
Morning nobody out.
No night-out.

339
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,210
Understood.
Is sick.

340
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,860
Is it far to the flock?

341
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,420
If you walk
- and a half-hour.

342
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,890
Maybe I should go.

343
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,650
If left alone
- will die.
You will surely die.

344
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,390
My name is kyae.

345

What do host?
Or keep icons in the house?

348
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,670
No what to ask then return.

349
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:16,390
Tired.
Do not take a bath?

350
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,290
Coffee with a cigarette also would
give.

351
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,140
How about opryaten?

352
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,370
And it is good to understand
sleeping with whom Jeanne now Baze.

353
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,910
What is heard about flying saucers?

354
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,890
Here the skeleton of a man, and
that's what.

355
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,070
I think it's second expedition
Union-gold.

356
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,050
Do not forget to send radio.

357
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:02,480
Maybe call the militia?
- Should?

358
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,870
I myself would commit ritual.

359
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,500
Tomb of an unknown martyr.

360
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,460
Mystery of tundra.

361
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,080
Clay went in clay-back.

362
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:56,420
This is the sad end.

363
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,120
<i>Tamara sat naked,</i>

364
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:28,030
<i>By ancient custom of women in the

365

<i>Naked body was common in their way
of life.</i>

366
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,540
<i>It was rational and good for health.</i>

367
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:41,740
<i>Kyae liked that his granddaughter

368
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:44,060
<i>And allows the body to breathe.</i>

369
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,940
Eat, eat.

Eat during the day, evening-eat.

372
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:07,770
When you feel the power
- Go.

373
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,130
My granddaughter will lead you to
the path.

374
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:16,300
Deer walk

375
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:20,090

376
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:25,150

384
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:13,020
Tell him Major.
I want results.
- What results?

385
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,790
Helicopter will get you there?
- Without charge is excluded.

386
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,220
Walk?
- Two days.

387
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,170
Major, did you get a solution?
- Let him bury.

388
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,520
Make-act.
Work is clear.

389
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:40,810
Yes, please check how keep
explosives-based.

390
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,870
What can you say about gold mining
in your area?

391
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,360
Janjic chosen region drunk something
like
- I do not care what chosen
Janjic,

392
00:52:56,510 --> 00:53:00,990
This is not a ground for research.
Listen order opryaten.

393
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:06,360
To autumn will you do plan report
for your area of gold mining.

394
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:14,260
Party has an approved project.
- I do not care project. Close it.

395
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:23,110
What goes dispute?
We conduct work mainly in the upper.

396
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:26,950
We must descend into tundra.
To shake tributaries of the main
rivers.

397
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:31,920
People to move elsewhere.
Stop here, and send them there.

398
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,530
Two or three lines of the main water
arteries, and there's nothing to
argue.

399
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:43,450
Reasonable.
- Please never shout at me.

400
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,960
Secondly, I want precise
instructions to search for gold.

401
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:50,890
And also want a written instruction
to cancel the project.

402
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,890
Without it I can not change the
schedule of work.

403
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:57,350
Engineer-geologist is not only an
engineer,

404
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,530
He must have a code of honor.

405

gold in the territory.

406
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:08,330
Results of his work are unknown.
And to run.

407
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,520
Plain friendly debt, you want me a
piece of paper?

408
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:15,170
This is demagogy.
- Demagogy ye.

409
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:21,160
Your order is clear.
How can run it will tell Guri.

410
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,770
And your grandfather should feel
shame for you apryatin.

411
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:33,800
Beautifully played, George.
Here it is said boss.

412
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:39,090
There savvy, has a purpose.
And absolutely no prejudices-called
ethics.

413
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,000
Bad person.
- They spanking. Take it like a man.

414
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:49,960
Dodgers manifest in everyday life,

415
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:54,200
And the martyrs are kept in memory.
Where to put the cross?

416
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:59,600
Judge alone.
Cynic his Andrei. Sucks.
- I'm not a
cynic.

417
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,900
I'm single philosopher.

<i>Here holy adhere to the principles

<i>Principle formulated long before

<i>He sounded like a short order the
world: do or die.</i>

Half of them have in their hands 2-3
deficit professions.

Half jewelers at work.
When not drunk.

429
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,080
Grab those who give you.
And most importantly,

430
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:36,800
There was still such a case with a
stick can compel a man.

431
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,260
To be a man.

432
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,440
Delivered materials noted in the
book, accommodation me somewhere.

433
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,550

00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:51,930
Twenty-fifth week after.
Not yet fully ready.

435

Nothing will live construction.
Write direction, while take-clothes.

Come with me, get you home.

437
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,430
Will provide salary.
Will pull his wife.

Surely dreaming naked women

<i>Many roads leading to the capital of
Soviet Lithuania,</i>

440
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:52,110
<i>And go from the city to its suburbs.</i>

441
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,200
<i>From east and west, north and south.</i>

442
00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:01,290
<i>Everywhere I see is typical for the
surrounding area of Vilnius,

443
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:08,090
And always, descended into the
valley of the mountains surrounding
Vilnius

444
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:13,530
We admire the lovely city and its
surroundings.

445
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:23,170
Head to dig pits in the fall when
frosts come.

446
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,800
To take and they put in this clay

447
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:33,750

Only plebeians considered happiness
to keep your ass up and do nothing.

450
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:47,030
And is not I a plebeian?
Plebeian'm.

Arctic no-plebeians.

452
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:54,760
And pits you think, who stacked
them?

453
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,860
No princes of the channels-shoot.

454
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,580
Not-chief.
Most idiotic orders do not
understand.

455
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:07,620
Tomorrow last day will work.
In the vicinity of Vilnius.

456
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:11,230
Long.
I think this is an ultimatum.

457
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,560
Finished the night.
Go to bed.

458
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:26,930

What's wrong?
What you need?

460
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:35,820
Since we are the only ones living in
this unfinished building

461
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,520
I would like to.

Completely different taste.
- Who

field.

465

To me every night invaded various
types of brandy.

466
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,360
Today will not invade.
We will defend.

467
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:03,000
I'm hungry as a stray cat.
Or dog-like.

468
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:06,050
As a stray cat
- dog.

469
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,830
What's your name?
- How do I say that?

470

Dear comrade gergusheva.
Here's who I am.

471
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:19,530
Go for compote.

472

475
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:04,400
And what?
Come you fed up there?

476
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:09,590
No, thanks.

477
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,170
We as liberated Austria from the
Nazis,

478
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,370
One year I was there in special
groups.

479
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,030
Assembly technologies.

Hozyayka lodgings Frau Louisa

481
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,840
Every morning she brought me coffee
in-room.

482
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:53,920
And cream, of course.
In a separate pot.

483
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,770
Incidentally real china.

484
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,430
But women are wives.

485
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:07,070
In short, makes coffee in Vienna.

486
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:12,320
My son would have turned
twenty-today.

487
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:18,070
The war started, and I here looking
for gold.

488
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:22,470
I could not get back to him in
Leningrad.

489
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,290
Vicissitudes of life.

490
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,380
How to know where our lurking.

491
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,300
Hidden trouble.

492
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,900
Her little need.

493
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,350
Must be fried without oil.

494
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:02,790
In any case not to put a lid and
remove it immediately,

495
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,000
After the venison becomes white.

496
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:09,730
Well you is prepared.
I did nothing I.

497
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:13,470
This is called venison-pasteurized.

498
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:18,010
In fact related to the geological
profession kitchen.

499
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:26,290
So why you staring at me?
Yes, I'm hungry.

500
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:30,140
It is embarrassing to hear people
when he eats.

501
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:33,100
First appear as a cook for someone.

502
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:37,220
Nice when just out-engaging.
I feel better.

503
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,480
Tell me something better-heroic.

504
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:48,990
Have you stand next to a grove or
river

505
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,750
And dream that this city has ever.

506
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:55,380
I'm not the emperor?

507
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:59,230
Our brother in the best case can
daydream this:

508
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:04,120
Here will serve three drilling rigs,
ten tents.

509
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,110
And fifty-man.

510
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:12,890
Good evening.
- Why are you so tense?

511
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:16,740
Order to arrest you wear, or decree
for 24 hours?

512
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,690
You will fly?
- To.

513
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,410
Try a sleek quickly leave everything
else.

514
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:44,340
Mini-morning.

515
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:47,400
Keep in mind that you'll get about 5
days.

516
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,780
Goodbye.

517
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:04,480
<i>People zhora apryatin floated down
the river.
Losinaya rubber-boats.</i>

518
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:08,620
<i>In late fall, shortly before spring,
when all the irregularities of the
tundra.</i>

519
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:11,680
<i>Snow-covered and covered by cold
weather,</i>

520
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,780
<i>Party leads in the mountains with
aircraft.</i>

521
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:18,640
<i>In autumn, when the aircraft can not
land on rocks,</i>

522
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,790
<i>There are only two outcomes.</i>

523
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:25,080
<i>Party transported by tractors and
trains, if possible,</i>

524
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:28,540
<i>Walk or go to the rivers and down to
the ocean,</i>

525
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:32,180
<i>Where they take all the available
vehicles.</i>

526
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:36,700
<i>The last option is the most
dangerous.
Many environmentalists tragically
died</i>

527
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:39,240
<i>Thus ending the season.</i>

528
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:48,280
<i>Once finished with the removal,
kutsenko walked to the base of
mongolov.</i>

529
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:53,040
<i>As Ilya Nikolayevich said that there
will wait, then wait for him.</i>

530
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:06,280
<i>Rapidly cooling to minus-30.
Rivers froze overnight</i>

531
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:09,950
<i>Zhora apryatin sting of cold and
awareness</i>

532
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,130
<i>That the work is not done well.</i>

533
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,620
<i>Exemplary study of the beautiful
territory not get.</i>

534
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:21,080
<i>Idiotic order of finches is filled,
but nothing was found.</i>

535
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:25,490
<i>Zhora knew severstroy not recognize
objective difficulties.</i>

536
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:29,040
<i>Therefore he must be responsible for
omissions map.</i>

537
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:33,550
<i>Draft party practically interrupted,
and nothing in return.</i>

538
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:43,870
<i>I understand from lead</i>

539
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:48,810
Lifetime deal with cassiterite.
The issue of mines was agreed.

540
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:54,320
But this will not happen, nor leave,
nor mini.

541
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:58,470
Here needs you.

542
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,540
I suggest you to front for
intelligence-bulk gold.

543
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:06,790
It is frivolous, Ilia Nikolaevich.

544
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:12,980
I will not do.
I will not participate in this
adventure.

545
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:23,820
If I order?

546
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:37,530
For the first time in my life, to
meet the order with medical
conclusion.

547
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,410
Do not force me to do it.

548
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:47,570
Heart thing worries me.
These days will travel to Moscow.

549
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,780
I'm going to the doctor.
And will not ask you to provide a
report on childrens plase oven,

550
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:53,950
Before returning.

551
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:57,450
Mercury thank you.

552
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,830
Well, I'll wait for your return.

553
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,220
Vladimir sem?novich.

554
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:15,930
Thank you.

555
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:38,410
Forward!
Inmates of Jupiter!

556
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:56,480
<i>Hold on, guys!</i>

557
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:06,290
<i>Guri was not in the boats-April.</i>

558
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,000
<i>He performs a simple debt-friendly.</i>

559
01:12:10,150 --> 01:12:12,170
<i>Bury the remains of geologist.</i>

560
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,610
<i>And then moved into a single route
to the ocean.</i>

561
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:19,850
<i>Cape of whalers, where you have to
take them Eskimo boats.</i>

562
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,410
<i>Hello people!
- Hello, Evgeny Alexandrovich.</i>

563
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:27,060
The whole party is here.

564
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:29,910
The route is completed without a
single casualty.

565
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:36,540
Who said that we can not?
We can!
We really.

566
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:40,270
Poleem to the end of the season?

567
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:43,360
<i>Then I and the water will jump.</i>

568
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:50,610
<i>Drink us, Doctor.
You're strong personality. Finches
and your strong personality.</i>

569
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:53,430
But what will you do without us, the
workers.

570
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:57,530
With your permission, Head, then.
Alone.

571
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,740
Once in middle Asia's Rising.

572
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:10,640
Three days a ridge, almost
inaccessible,

573
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:15,080
For there to drink 50 grams of
cognac,

574
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,400
Look above the ground,

575
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,420
And to think of the time-being.

576
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:27,010
Why I did it?

577
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:31,800
The answer is easy.

578
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:34,120
Centuries-delusion.

579
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:38,360
Desire, whatever it cost you to
prove your originality.

580
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,230
That I am not like other.

581
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:46,730
Will die.

582
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,850
What you mean?

583
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:55,430
So your face is sad.

584
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,340
Nonsense.
It is important to keep the
distance.

585
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:04,150
Follow the rules of the busiest
places in sadohodstvo.

586
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,970
The secret.

587
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:12,260
Boats come.

588
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:20,570
<i>By the unwritten laws of severstroy,
geologist, returned from the field,</i>

589
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,270
<i>His allotted three days for
free-bath.</i>

590
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:26,350
<i>The same unwritten law, on the
fourth day,</i>

591
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:30,030
<i>It has to come in at 9am management
shaved</i>

592
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:33,170
<i>Well-dressed, and completely sober.</i>

593
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:39,510
Hello, woman.

594
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:45,870
Welcome.

595
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:52,040
You will live here?
Abalakov?
- Baklakov meanings.

596
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:56,340
Baklakov.

597
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:00,560
He went to his family home in the
village.

598
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:03,820
He your friend?
- I have friends.

599
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:06,570
I only known, as all our time.

600
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:10,820
And with baklakov-lived last winter.

601
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,860
It is convenient.
Ordinary man.

602
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:17,740
Busy with muscles and geology.
Wonderful not to speak

603
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:20,510
Women also.
- Yes, it is very good.

604
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:23,760
He is a wonderful.

605
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:27,150
Soviet-ordinary fan.
- And you?

606
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:32,180
And I'm penultimate adventurer.
- Penultimate why?

607
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:35,410
It would be insulting to-last.
Cognac?

608
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:38,310
Cognac.

609
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:51,270
Cognac should be drunk from cups
gilded.

610
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:56,620
Only gives color.

611
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:03,270
Where did you get such a cognac?
- Acquaintances send me.

612
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,380
Books, drinks, plates.

613
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:12,880
Care to keep up-time.

614
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:18,460
I only smoke cigars, as Churchill.

615
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:23,010
I want to live to a ripe old age,
and to see how all this will end.

616
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:26,890
What exactly?
Sorry that so resembles the
interview.

617
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:31,630
Do what?

618
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:35,510
Respect journalists.

619
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:40,260
What will you do?
Universal satisfaction.

620
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,100
Apartments, clothes, cars.

621
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,100
Users conquer the world.

622
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:49,930
And to hell.
To drink your career.

623
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,200
To drink.

624
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:01,430
And you want to create a matrix of
all correspondence local theme?

625
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:03,640
Listen.

626
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:10,560
Track storm enthusiasm

627
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:16,250
Snowy expanses, a young worker,
adult-nomad.

628
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:21,780
It is now my profession.
- My respect. Work-esteem.

629
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:25,820
And my neighbor, my neighbor
respects baklakov work.

630
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:29,380
Here we all respect the work.
- All-you.

631
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,640
I'm not all.
I am separately.

632
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:37,050
Bum, that's who I am.
- How do you manage to be a bum?

633
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:43,770
Postdoctoral am.
I know profession level of average
doctor.

634
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:48,280
Speak two languages.
With such a load anywhere I welcome
guest.

635
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:52,490
If I get bored here, I will find a
place on the map, and will go there.

636
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,900
Movements allow you to not have a
lot of luggage.

637
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:00,400
It is more convenient.

638
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:05,040
And do not you empty?
- Sorry I.

639
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:13,430
Previously conquered land
chingizhanove, Tamerlane,
Macedonian,

640
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,330
Now tightly and shaken him
conquer-users.
They are everywhere.

641
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:26,050
Lake Titicaca to Mozhaisk.
Most ruthless conquest.

642
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,380
So adore adventurers.

643
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:32,390
Users put them outside the law.
Therefore adapt.

644
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:36,590
I want to protect their
self-satisfaction in general.

645
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:39,740
I do not want anything to possess
but themselves.

646
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,430
Horrific man.

647
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:48,830
Startling men walk in cafes and pull
port through a straw,

648
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:52,400
Portraying the squandering of life.

649
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:55,140
I am still penultimate adventurer

650
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:59,510
But work not worse than those
polar-supermen.
You want to see them?

651
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:03,230
I. But how?
- Evening geologists.

652
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:08,200
Heroes of the tundra with a bottle
of wine.
Strangers are not allowed.

653
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:12,810
It is a treasure trove for
journalist.
- Invite me?

654
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:16,290
Do you?
On the evening of geologists?

655
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,280
You know, Ivan egorovich,

656
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:51,440
This birth.

657
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:55,790
Of global importance.
Mongolov claims that hill.

658
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,790
Almost entirely composed of mercury.

659
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:02,290
Brought one t.

660
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:06,420
Just like that, they passed from
there, loaded, and brought.

661
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:15,750
Because you flew to Moscow?

662
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:23,110
Robin twice already calling me.

663
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,510
You do not believe me, do you?

664
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:47,460
What is this?

665
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:50,220
See for yourself.

666
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,630
That is gold does not exist.

667
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:37,660
With chute you wash it?

668
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:49,020
What you need, Elijah?

669
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:55,690
Money.
Large. And once-money.

670
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,980
Secretly flown?
- To.

671
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:13,010
And gold also found a secret.

672
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:17,300
This is not a primer is not like the
river.

673
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:22,520
There is a lot of work and without
much intelligence nothing to find.

674
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:25,240
Money will find a new birth.

675
01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:36,380
Another winner looking for?

676
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:42,970
Another laureate of course, is not
bad,

677
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,910
But you know Vanya, what I want.

678
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,610
Before I die, when I catch now the
third attack,

679
01:23:51,710 --> 01:23:54,580
Tell myself that I'm not ashamed.

680
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:58,990
For his life.
And what was intended, all I filled.

681
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:02,380
Or at least I tried to do it.

682
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:04,970
Right?

683
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:10,820
Why spend jug.
Just so, or.

684
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:18,800
<i>Where disappeared Finches?
Second day I can not get him.
End.</i>

685
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:27,590
SUVs received fully justified itself
in the polar conditions.

686
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:33,360
The pole thank you, Comrade robikin.
End.

687
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:38,430
<i>Where Finches.
End.</i>

688
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:44,140
She went to hospital because of
heart.

689
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:48,310
All field parties returned safely.
End.

690
01:24:50,730 --> 01:24:54,270
<i>Furtetski, autonomy you did there?
End.</i>

691
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:01,410
What autonomy, Comrade robikin.

692
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:06,510
Send preliminary report after week
you personally.
End.

693
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,670
<i>I wish the management team success.
End.</i>

694
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:21,730
<i>Baklakov late.
His father died three days before he
arrives.</i>

695
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:24,630
<i>All the things his father gave them.</i>

696
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:27,900
<i>For myself left a large family photo
album.</i>

697
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:32,080
<i>Now baklakov with irrefutable
clarity understands that now,</i>

698
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:36,240
<i>The only thing is, this is a room on
the shore of the icy ocean.</i>

699
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:38,570
<i>And his home territory is.</i>

700
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:51,860
Good-bye.
Here, read-Wrangel. It will benefit.

701
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:54,200
Andrew, let's talk.

702
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:58,920
Problems with the report?
- Almost.

703
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:03,040
Logic is easy.

704
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:06,470
Your situation is not sad, but
rather joyfully.

705
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:10,870
Because you have the right to write
custom report

706
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:15,060
I will be serious.
Have you read the reports of the
classics?

707
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:20,760
Of mushketov on Obruchev,
Bogdanovic?
You are not?

708
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:27,890
And what you studied six years?
Classics wrote novels geological.

709
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:32,740
Essays are written by private
variations hypothesize.

710
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:38,300
But not too lazy to describe the
landscape so as to penetrate with
atmosphere.

711
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,880
With their way of thinking.
- Well.

712
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:43,440
And what to do with Section
minerals?

713
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:47,910
What can not you take, it's
stubborn.

714
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:51,660
I suggest you to write an essay
geological.

715
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:54,030
The free play of the mind.

716
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:59,090
With your personal concept device of
the globe in our region.

717
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:04,160
And then minerals alone will come
into place.

718
01:27:04,570 --> 01:27:08,980
Try to understand why Buddha seeks
gold.

719
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:14,480
And mind you, Buddha will do a
step-vain.

720
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:19,120
He is the only smart person among
you, Superman.

721
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:23,480
Stop nagging.
- But if you see the sacred fire

722
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:28,160
Thoughts in your eyes, take
I-petrography.

723
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:30,550
I agree.

724
01:27:33,690 --> 01:27:35,700
To, inter alia,

725
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:38,710
I lost a bet with our friend-dozen
champagne.

726
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:43,360
Try to come over tonight.
- No, I will work.

727
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:48,780
As you want.
- Maybe nine will go.

728
01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:53,050
<i>Baklanov whole festive week spent in
management,</i>

729
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,160
<i>Working on your report.</i>

730
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:59,060
<i>Color paper, there was a four-world.</i>

731
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:02,160
<i>In conjunction with the earthmoving,</i>

732
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:06,240
<i>With its cracks, with blasts of
depth magmas,</i>

733
01:29:06,490 --> 01:29:09,830
<i>Boisterous insanity of volcanic
eruptions.</i>

734
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:15,730
<i>Purple field of Triassic, Paleozoic
predpolozhitelno array-east.</i>

735
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:20,560
<i>South extends line of
Tunguska-nagorie.</i>

736
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,720
<i>He had imagined history.</i>

737
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:31,580
<i>Faults inexplicably my thoughts
constantly returned to faults.</i>

738
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:36,390
<i>They pass them on ridges-failures.
Them pass and river valleys.</i>

739
01:29:36,670 --> 01:29:40,620
<i>Steep ridges.
In them passes magma</i>

740
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:44,530
<i>They form the relief.
What are its faults?</i>

741
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:52,180
<i>And suddenly thought, no need to
deepen the sea of facts.</i>

742
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:54,940
<i>He can not now hide behind giblets.</i>

743
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,530
<i>The power of prophets in their moral
confidence.</i>

744
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:02,690
<i>It should create a base.
Details will come later.</i>

745
01:30:03,670 --> 01:30:06,790
<i>Gold they have at least so that the
signs are springing up everywhere.</i>

746
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,320
<i>This is a fact.</i>

747
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:12,750
<i>It came with granite.
And this is a fact.</i>

748
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:17,660
<i>Nor one of the granite massifs, no
one has seen gold as ore.</i>

749
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:20,180
<i>This is the third-fact.</i>

750
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,930
<i>Baklakov took a piece of paper, a
pen,</i>

751
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:32,360
<i>And suddenly instead of thoughtful
list of questions began to write a
letter.</i>

752
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,040
<i>He started writing silly letter.</i>

753
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:38,500
<i>For an acquaintance who once got
drunk, he lit a cigarette.</i>

754
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:42,070
<i>Magnifying glass of the Northern
Lights.
For cockroach salmon</i>

755
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:44,840
<i>Who lives in a crack above his bed.</i>

756
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:48,470
<i>She wrote the letter, he realized
quite clearly,</i>

757
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:53,580
<i>There is a special type of granite,
yet unknown to us.</i>

758
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:58,330
<i>In this case, we should expect
birthplace of gold</i>

759
01:30:58,490 --> 01:31:00,660
<i>In all the rivers of the territory.</i>

760
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:06,620
<i>That night he discovered most
importantly, intuition and
confidence.</i>

761
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:10,070
<i>He knew he was right.</i>

762
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:21,720
Good morning.
- Is good.

763
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:24,800
Where have you been?
Why not go?

764
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:31,480
Guri left a note.
He asked me to tell you.

765
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:34,680
He is now with me.
Busy report.

766
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:39,370
Some cheerful and son.

767
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:43,350
Somehow-color.

768
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:48,510
Which is Tamara?
- Tamara.

769
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:02,020
Today I had a good night.

770
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:07,080
Suddenly woke me joy for the coming
summer.

771
01:32:09,110 --> 01:32:13,090
If it believes the mongolov then
reduced amount of evil on earth.

772
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:18,160
My God, under the influence of Guri,
will soon become a philosopher.

773
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:21,940
And you must not become such.
You understand plain Superman.

774
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:27,350
For it should write in newspapers.
- Go to the tundra, look people.

775
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:30,500
Now workers at mongolov as screws,

776
01:32:30,650 --> 01:32:33,550
Our hammer to beat us with pliers to
pull.

777
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:36,810
They must write.

778
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:41,850
Not these thy screws any other.
Such should not write.

779
01:32:42,610 --> 01:32:45,160
Should those who come here for
romance,

780
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:47,550
To have clean and smooth-past.

781
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:50,560
I bad journalist.
Otherwise I do not is prepared.

782
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:53,770
Yes, they are not smooth.
Are special.

783
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:58,180
They are the first in those places
where then will be coming for
romance.

784
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:02,000
Maybe there really will be a city,
and not one, but understand,

785
01:33:02,150 --> 01:33:04,160
City of empty space is not built-.

786
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:06,870
Here should appear worker nicknamed
kefir.

787
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:10,790
Biography of kefir is not holy, but
not without hard work kefir,

788
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:12,900
And kefir gone without hard work.

789
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:17,110
Perhaps this is his holiness?

790
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:19,280
You know.

791
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,530
Your duty to be a very good man.

792
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:25,130
Why?

793
01:33:27,110 --> 01:33:30,440
There are people who are more
serious than others.

794
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:34,190
Some of them all goes without
consequences, but to them it.

795
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:36,360
And they are required to be better.

796
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:40,290
And if he has decided to live your
dreams, then double-bound.

797
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,950
Why?
- Because the majority.

798
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:45,370
Afraid to live your dreams.

799
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:50,050
<i>Mouth of the river.
Elga. Intelligence-eastern section.</i>

800
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,200
<i>Depth 10 m.</i>

801
01:33:54,110 --> 01:33:56,230
Ah, your boss.

802
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:59,650
I've taken the lead,

803
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:04,930
Vermouth or port, Tips.

804
01:34:05,790 --> 01:34:08,700
And rested peacefully.

805
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:14,740
But rule production does not sleep,

806
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:19,020
Measure the work you constantly
worry is.

807
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:24,410
How you sleep here?
Soon everything will fall.

808
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:29,720
And producing what is Sedona?

809
01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:33,910
Exactly.
It is a tree.

810
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:38,440
It grown-workers.

811
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:41,970
Superiors gone -

812
01:34:43,050 --> 01:34:45,730
Calm-worker.

813
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:04,080
We do guys.

814
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:07,680
I swear to God that we.

815
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,920
There still there?
- You have a happy eye.
Go down below.

816
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,540
<i>Workers!</i>

817
01:35:22,570 --> 01:35:24,710
Salute with the right hand!

818
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:28,440
March at the word, start with the
right foot.

819
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:31,440
Rockets fired-up.

820
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:35,510
And guys are trying in vain not
laze.

821
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,460
Here Vladimir Mikhailovich.

822
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:51,820
Where?
- Line 430.
Eight-pit.

823
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:03,150
Exactly the tenth-meter.

824
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:08,940
Maybe you alcohol?

825
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:13,010
Forbidden us.
Will frighten luck.

826
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,640
Law of diligent.

827
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:19,800
Kefir!

828
01:36:20,730 --> 01:36:23,660
Boiler let go.
We must promiem.

829
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:29,600
Spring-washing.
The summer can not traem.

830
01:36:35,710 --> 01:36:39,000
<i>Washing line gave nothing.</i>

831
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:41,880
<i>Pits proved futile.</i>

832
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:47,390
<i>Mongolov ordered to spend the boiler
to the next line.</i>

833
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,430
<i>The second line did not give
anything.</i>

834
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:53,630
<i>Hunters hung over the plight of
Misfortune.</i>

835
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:10,840
<i>Where is the logic,
thought-mongolov.</i>

836
01:37:11,230 --> 01:37:14,510
<i>Samorodok big as an egg is no longer
considered a sign.</i>

837
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:17,000
<i>This can not occur accidentally.</i>

838
01:37:17,670 --> 01:37:20,810
<i>Only not with samorodkite alive gold
industry.</i>

839
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,020
<i>It is alive with sand and dust.</i>

840
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:26,690
<i>Sand, and dust of gold is detected
by washing.</i>

841
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:30,440
<i>Mongolov fluency gambling.
He knew</i>

842
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:34,880
<i>That the ideas of the chief engineer
must reach much farther from Elga.</i>

843
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,600
I read your report, Sergei
Alexandrovich.

844
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:51,820
In your reasoning makes sense
unconditionally.

845
01:37:57,550 --> 01:38:01,740
I suggest you to specify route and
the organization of the main party.

846
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:05,970
I suggest to you the chief of the
party.

847
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:10,560
The task is to pass over land
management, and to write a report,

848
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:14,990
Which will give a forecast for gold
mining complex.

849
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:17,570
Will co me.

850
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,970
For dishwasher will give you
kutsenko.

851
01:38:21,710 --> 01:38:23,890
Substitute for grab-Guri.

852
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:27,750
I have no contacts with forests for
personal reasons.

853
01:38:29,150 --> 01:38:32,660
Valley of the ELGA must have exactly
this example,

854
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:34,750
Which is described in a report.

855
01:38:38,090 --> 01:38:42,290
You guessed.
But actually I think that you have
known for throughout.

856
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:46,520
I suggest you the most complex and
important party in the government.

857
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:59,940
Project I need a week.

858
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:05,400
Baklakov remember, whatever is
complex and longer route to invent,

859
01:39:05,950 --> 01:39:08,140
He still will not be enough.

860
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:11,910
And another council.
After clarify the route the aircraft
hold.

861
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:14,670
And discard the provision in
barrels.

862
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:18,680
Results meet personally.

863
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:22,270
Methods to use to perform the work

864
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:25,310
They do not care.
- This is my concern.

865
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:32,610
The care you have hot brain to give
ideas

866
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:36,090
And immediately reconcile them with
reality.

867
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:39,090
Among people know wisdom.

868
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:42,650
Obligate you to be ruthless and wise
in everything

869
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,870
That case-gold complex.

870
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:49,510
And your future depends entirely on
the summer.

871
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:55,220
I wish you success.
And not force me to be disappointed
in you.

872
01:39:55,370 --> 01:39:57,600
I believe in your ability.

873
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:12,100
<i>Find a nice place to camp.</i>

874
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:19,180
Provision so the next trip.
To load-detonator.

875
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:24,280
Head, there is still room.
To load food.

876
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:26,520
Food with a second-rate.

877
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:31,210
Transportation detonator is
vzrivcheto substance along strictly
prohibited.

878
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:33,950
Respond in-law.

879
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:36,810
<i>Let me go.</i>

880
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:44,790
Head, lest your new?
Confused plane donkey?

881
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:48,940
A donkey will load whatever you
want.
End to stop-loading.

882
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:51,470
Yes, well-finished.

883
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:55,760
<i>But what is?
- It is the food.</i>

884
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:00,830
In tundra everything happens.
Last year two weeks waiting plane.

885
01:41:00,980 --> 01:41:03,480
You do not go there to eat, but to
work.

886
01:41:09,850 --> 01:41:15,060
<i>Aircraft and successfully went back.
But the evening was played blizzard.</i>

887
01:41:15,210 --> 01:41:17,220
Seryoga, wait!

888
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:21,670
<i>And only the seventh day was good
with good-prognosis.</i>

889
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:26,620
<i>Arriving at the airfield, opryaten
realized that the only aircraft
capable.</i>

890
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:31,410
<i>Baklakov-captured.
April remained his only pray.</i>

891
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:35,390
<i>Baklakov his route not ruin plane</i>

892
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:38,110
<i>And those two have the courage to
wait.</i>

893
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:40,870
<i>Salakhov food and the fire god-no.</i>

894
01:41:41,230 --> 01:41:43,630
<i>Opryaten nobody told about</i>

895
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:47,090
<i>Although I understand that if
Salakhov and fire god to die</i>

896
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:49,790
<i>It will remain only to shoot.</i>

897
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:58,060
<i>Six barrels of provision and a
rubber-boats.</i>

898
01:41:58,210 --> 01:42:01,640
<i>To recapture the upcoming heroic
route of maklakov,</i>

899
01:42:01,790 --> 01:42:04,960
<i>They were filled, stitched with
wire, and loaded on the plane.</i>

900
01:42:05,490 --> 01:42:09,830
<i>Baklakov transferred from the card,
the navigation map.</i>

901
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:14,360
<i>Pilot bardikin fight, all the places
where to throw barrels.</i>

902
01:42:14,930 --> 01:42:18,480
<i>Kutsenko week before it went to the
mail plane.</i>

903
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:21,250
<i>He must employ or buy a boat there.</i>

904
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:24,570
<i>To spend a tractor carriage to the
mouth of Serrano River,</i>

905
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:26,730
<i>And book-base there.</i>

906
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:31,540
Now quickly landing take kutsenko
and immediately go.

907
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:36,150
Holy shit.
This damn nose never know.

908
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:39,420
There wind, will not you hello!

909
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:43,040
Of management are.
Land!

910
01:42:43,930 --> 01:42:47,860
Senja-slacker.
At least he was tied to the
stake-pants.

911
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:51,890
Give a ours.
A fire.

912
01:42:52,050 --> 01:42:54,100
I will do another circle.

913
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:36,050
Engineer.

914
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:42,330
Plane with a coworker today nasal
baners suffered disaster.

915
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:45,560
All live.
When will fix it is not clear.

916
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:49,100
Now you can not hang here.

917
01:44:03,390 --> 01:44:05,400
Sick

918
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:09,100
Visitors have.
Command.

919
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:23,920
Generator operates to 11: 00.
I'll bring kerosene lamp.

920
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,500
Well, talk her.

921
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:40,010
How did you know?

922
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:52,880
When will you meet 18?
Will you marry me?

923
01:44:53,730 --> 01:44:55,980
Next year.
Will marry.

924
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:58,790
You're good, strong.

925
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:02,610
Although now not at all beautiful.

926
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:39,860
And what are you waiting for?

927
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:44,790
Time did not allow.
I have no plane.

928
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:50,350
I thought a lot about you-April.

929
01:45:51,730 --> 01:45:57,260
My grandfather asked me.
If your people have died, will give
you a court.

930
01:46:12,590 --> 01:46:16,360
Go to the radio and send on behalf
of my radio in the city.

931
01:46:16,890 --> 01:46:20,130
That urgently need en suite 2-ski.

932
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:24,880
Do you believe in God?

933
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:28,870
Komsomolets I.

934
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:34,300
These days I prayed.

935
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:43,080
Pray opryaten pray.

936
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:06,100
Salakhov.

937
01:47:06,290 --> 01:47:10,330
Will you eat me?
- Where hanging, Chief?

938
01:49:26,210 --> 01:49:30,120
What do you need?
- Katyn died.
Michael Arkadievich.

939
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:33,990
Quiet!
Katyn died.

940
01:49:58,810 --> 01:50:00,810
Katyn mouse.

941
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:06,170
He saw the world of wondrous heights
of high moral truths.

942
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,740
And we.

943
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:14,700
Live, die-galling.

944
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:19,420
And many evils of this world.

945
01:50:23,530 --> 01:50:25,930
This means that the overall task of
the people

946
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:29,300
And especially yours, this evil to
eliminate it.

947
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,230
In wartime clearly we felt automats.

948
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:42,040
And in peace-time.

949
01:50:43,690 --> 01:50:45,740
Honest work,

950
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:49,740
It should serve to remove this
universal evil.

951
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:54,310
This is the highest-sense.

952
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:18,210
What is the likelihood that the cat
Vasya, pressing, where fall with his
paw.

953
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:22,320
Will print the tale of King
somersault typewriter?

954
01:51:23,690 --> 01:51:28,420
One-to-three billion.
Possibility to leave in my party

955
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:31,580
About this possibility.

956
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:36,650
And no editorial tasks will help.

957
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:42,790
There is cold, from which you can
not hide, mud, grim.

958
01:51:44,370 --> 01:51:47,240
Eventually, sometimes nothing to
eat.

959
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:51,950
I can.

960
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:02,780
Not suppress.
Look at everything with new eyes.

961
01:52:04,610 --> 01:52:08,410
It starts with something useful.
Write a novel.

962
01:52:09,410 --> 01:52:11,440
For us supermen.

963
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:14,900
I give you the first-row.

964
01:52:15,530 --> 01:52:20,450
On the banks of the icy ocean,
watching the sunset, and melting
ice,

965
01:52:21,070 --> 01:52:23,650
Stand-two swords.
- Go already.

966
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:41,820
<i>I love you, like diving into an ice
hole
- fun and creepy.</i>

967
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:49,260
<i>I love you with the same benefit to
wait yesterday.</i>

968
01:52:51,690 --> 01:52:56,970
<i>I love you is like to catch the wind
in the field
- as useless.</i>

969
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:04,310
<i>I love you is like an iron will to
trust the cliff-.</i>

970
01:53:06,130 --> 01:53:11,110
<i>I love you, I forget other, what is
better than this lot.</i>

971
01:53:12,510 --> 01:53:17,590
<i>And in secret from you from the pain
of eternal pain to howl like a wolf.</i>

972
01:53:18,850 --> 01:53:23,440
<i>I love you is like water in the
desert swallows without quenches
thirst.</i>

973
01:53:25,450 --> 01:53:30,130
<i>And in tune with your desire,
suddenly was rejected.</i>

974
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:37,620
<i>I love you like to swim in the sea,
where they showered and waves.</i>

975
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:43,360
<i>Voistinu to love
- not generosity
License.</i>

976
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:50,110
<i>I love you so dangerous as to climb
mountains.</i>

977
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:54,600
<i>But my God, you're so beautiful,</i>

978
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:57,940
<i>Yes, impossible not to love.</i>

979
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:02,870
<i>Ngan-hills.
POS-circular station.</i>

980
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:05,060
<i>305 km.

981
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:34,900
Congratulations arrival boss.

982
01:54:41,170 --> 01:54:44,420
And mountain skiing?
- To.

983
01:54:45,970 --> 01:54:49,690
King of Ghanaian hills I am.
- To the south you went?

984
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:55,510
Of course.
Now dividing found granite fragment.

985
01:54:56,470 --> 01:54:58,970
Maybe just not tip not pushed magma.

986
01:55:03,530 --> 01:55:07,390
<i>Wonderful contact.
Laboratory-ready.</i>

987
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:11,160
But it should be clear.

988
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:17,230
Wait counsel-word.

989
01:55:19,550 --> 01:55:23,160
-check everything in detail.
Take Sedona with her.

990
01:55:23,790 --> 01:55:27,230
He training for mountain running.
And remove these aggregates.

991
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:29,910
I'll get tired.

992
01:55:30,070 --> 01:55:32,810
<i>Three ice-valley.
158 km. Population.</i>

993
01:55:33,030 --> 01:55:38,120
<i>The plane that brought him back to
the base, took his young wife in the

994
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:42,960
<i>After a few days in the population
it back Uncle Kostya.</i>

995
01:55:55,730 --> 01:55:58,280
Good morning.
- Good morning.

996
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,060
How are you?
Froze it?

997
01:56:06,670 --> 01:56:08,670
And you worry.
Here.

998
01:56:36,030 --> 01:56:38,080
Coffee?
!

999
01:56:38,230 --> 01:56:41,420
- Of course, not the same as in
Vienna.

1000
01:57:00,530 --> 01:57:03,390
<i>God, I've grown up in Sokolniki.</i>

1001
01:57:03,610 --> 01:57:06,840
<i>10 years know everything about
humanity.</i>

1002
01:57:11,170 --> 01:57:13,490
<i>And I've seen happy people.</i>

1003
01:57:27,350 --> 01:57:32,340
<i>if any deluded man was found clever
and strong man,</i>

1004
01:57:32,830 --> 01:57:35,320
<i>Then humanity is worth nothing.</i>

1005
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:38,030
<i>But humanity is worth something.</i>

1006
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:44,020
<i>Fish where the fish swim?</i>

1007
01:57:45,390 --> 01:57:48,790
<i>In the water is dark.
They do not know where to swim.</i>

1008
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:53,280
<i>It should kindle fires.
To see.</i>

1009
01:57:53,810 --> 01:57:55,850
<i>How else?</i>

1010
01:57:57,310 --> 01:58:00,700
<i>Nobody should.
Nobody has the right to live in the
dark.</i>

1011
01:58:07,610 --> 01:58:09,920
<i>Ignite fires in the ocean.</i>

1012
01:58:27,850 --> 01:58:32,560
<i>Uncle Kostya was injured in February
1945 at the battle of Budapest.</i>

1013
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:36,760
<i>With debris from bombs.
A tiny left-ribs.</i>

1014
01:58:36,910 --> 01:58:40,620
<i>And a larger samples of silver, and
the heart-stopping.</i>

1015
01:58:40,870 --> 01:58:44,560
<i>He did not bother.
Only during strong concerns</i>

1016
01:58:44,710 --> 01:58:46,710
<i>Slight wiggle in the heart.</i>

1017
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:38,990
Listen.
Do not be afraid.

1018
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:43,340
They will seek.
They will necessarily find.

1019
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,760
Survive better?

1020
02:00:50,860 --> 02:00:55,400
Tractor drivers are prohibited to go
on the road without a tent,

1021
02:00:55,550 --> 02:00:59,680
Torch, sleeping bag, and weekly food
supply.

1022
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:38,040
Sergei Alexandrovich.

1023
02:01:39,370 --> 02:01:41,880
Guri-breaking legs.
- How so?

1024
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:47,120
With these units.
Sedona returned, he said skis are
broken.

1025
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:51,190
And both legs are broken.
Backbone supposedly healthy. We
must-go.

1026
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:53,790
Arctic foxes, like rats will eat
him.

1027
02:01:53,940 --> 02:01:55,970
A gun?
- I took him.

1028
02:01:56,220 --> 02:01:58,560
Guri is not of itself.
Shouting, roaring.

1029
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:03,260
Sedona put it to sleep, two hours
have to go.

1030
02:02:48,890 --> 02:02:52,330
<i>Baklakov much hated Guri at this
time.</i>

1031
02:02:53,090 --> 02:02:56,940
<i>He decided.
To the radio must be running alone.</i>

1032
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:03,330
<i>170 km.
Two days will pass through to keep
the feet of his colleague.</i>

1033
02:03:10,670 --> 02:03:13,550
<i>Valley small-china.
168 km. Meteo-up.</i>

1034
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:17,510
<i>As always, when a decision is taken
on his baklakov relieved.</i>

1035
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:20,660
<i>And now very sorry Guri.</i>

1036
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:24,140
<i>If Guria lost their legs end with
him.</i>

1037
02:03:24,310 --> 02:03:27,850
<i>It is not those who can stay a man
without legs.</i>

1038
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:49,930
Kyae!

1039
02:03:50,610 --> 02:03:53,890
God-sent.
- Did you forget?

1040
02:03:54,540 --> 02:03:57,650
When he was on the plane, we agreed.

1041
02:03:58,780 --> 02:04:02,280
Everything brought.
I left the base.

1042
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,220
My engineer broke his legs.
- I know.

1043
02:04:08,150 --> 02:04:10,200
Based told me.

1044
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:15,180
Of Meteo must bring him.
The passageway 170 km.

1045
02:04:16,370 --> 02:04:18,390
From there will viknem plane.

1046
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:21,460
Will drive.

1047
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:38,690
<i>Valley small-china.
51 km. Meteo-up.</i>

1048
02:07:40,510 --> 02:07:43,280
<i>Guri legibly see myself removed.</i>

1049
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:48,140
<i>In a set of actions, words,
coincidences, laws, facts.</i>

1050
02:07:49,410 --> 02:07:53,240
<i>Foreign and his aphorisms, proud
demeanor.</i>

1051
02:07:54,150 --> 02:07:59,340
<i>Andrei ignatyevich churin specialist
high-end single-philosopher.</i>

1052
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:05,540
<i>Ultimately, now lies in the valley
stupid, silly River</i>

1053
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:10,360
<i>And completely illiterate shepherd
tired deer to save him.</i>

1054
02:09:32,090 --> 02:09:37,220
<i>Now for baklakov it was important to
remove the borders with route of
apryatin,</i>

1055
02:09:37,650 --> 02:09:41,610
<i>And methodically, without sudden
movements, to work without grant.</i>

1056
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:44,360
<i>But to withstand this double-summer.</i>

1057
02:09:44,510 --> 02:09:48,640
<i>Marau-hills.
Replace the stack of routes baklakov
April.</i>

1058
02:09:52,370 --> 02:09:54,720
<i>Go for two days.
Wait-April.</i>

1059
02:12:26,510 --> 02:12:31,290
<i>All people-are doomed.
We are doomed to our work.</i>

1060
02:12:32,020 --> 02:12:37,100
<i>Fathers
- workers, women
- Host
beauties and millionaires.</i>

1061
02:12:37,250 --> 02:12:41,400
<i>All they destined for his role.
We are doomed to work.</i>

1062
02:12:42,210 --> 02:12:46,280
<i>And this is the best and largest in
the world-doom.</i>

1063
02:12:58,350 --> 02:13:00,440
Sedona!

1064
02:13:20,730 --> 02:13:24,110
Plans change.
Found gold.

1065
02:13:30,590 --> 02:13:34,510
We will wait for opryaten, and
return to base.

1066
02:13:51,140 --> 02:13:53,190
Of where you are?

1067
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:05,060
Seryoga!

1068
02:16:50,900 --> 02:16:54,170
Welcome.
- And so, Vladimir Mikhailovich

1069
02:16:55,270 --> 02:16:57,940
Money and additional people will
have.

1070
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:02,520
Barikin but continues the fight for
the eradication of management.

1071
02:17:02,670 --> 02:17:06,940
Instead they want to create an
extended party search of lead.

1072
02:17:07,250 --> 02:17:09,720
But boss wants you to appoint.

1073
02:17:11,140 --> 02:17:13,950
Moored nodes must immediately
logging.

1074
02:17:15,910 --> 02:17:18,020
I will continue the search for gold.

1075
02:17:18,170 --> 02:17:21,020
We will use all our experience of
mountain engineer.

1076
02:17:21,770 --> 02:17:25,700
Gold complex there, and I know that.
And still know

1077
02:17:25,860 --> 02:17:27,860
He would find.

1078
02:19:18,500 --> 02:19:20,570
I wish health, Comrade Chief.

1079
02:19:21,390 --> 02:19:24,100
A man of extraordinary decency
alcohol.

1080
02:19:25,390 --> 02:19:27,980
He found samorodok weighing 350 g.

1081
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:32,050
Is that heroism, Vladimir
Mikhailovich.
Say that refused alcohol

1082
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:36,530
Not to frighten luck, not ruin
monetary power of the state.

1083
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:39,880
Heroic departed spirits, which I had
proposed.

1084
02:19:40,190 --> 02:19:42,490
So was it?
- So so!

1085
02:19:43,950 --> 02:19:47,400
You have rich fur coat!
With such a fur coat, and Broadway

1086
02:19:47,550 --> 02:19:49,950
All American chicks will lie.

1087
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:59,020
The first human flight into space!

1088
02:19:59,170 --> 02:20:03,610
Our Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin into
space!

1089
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:06,510
Hurrah, comrades!
Hurrah!

1090
02:20:06,660 --> 02:20:12,210
<i>Talked Moscow!
Give notice TASS first land.</i>

1091
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:17,670
<i>Flight of man in space.</i>

1092
02:20:19,460 --> 02:20:24,920
<i>On April 12, 1961, in the Soviet
Union.</i>

1093
02:20:25,070 --> 02:20:31,550
<i>Into orbit around the earth the
world's first spacecraft.</i>

1094
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:36,960
<i>Vostok companion with a man on
board.</i>

1095
02:23:18,380 --> 02:23:20,880
<i>Finches assumptions materialize.</i>

1096
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:25,260
<i>They found a knot of gold-bearing
placers on territory.</i>

1097
02:23:25,960 --> 02:23:29,970
<i>It all happened in another century
and another land.</i>

1098
02:23:40,550 --> 02:23:43,470
<i>If the land had force to back.</i>

1099
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:45,870
All areas associated with gold

1100
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:49,250
<i>Who died in expeditions stranded on
the continent.</i>

1101
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:53,070
<i>All they had been through, these
years.
But not for the money.</i>

1102
02:23:53,220 --> 02:23:57,350
Because they know what they mean
money during the work-area.

1103
02:23:57,500 --> 02:24:01,270
<i>Not because of its debt as current
debt in the nature of man</i>

1104
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:04,690
<i>Rather than verbal formulation.
Not for the glory.</i>

1105
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:09,790
<i>But because of what the unknown, in
the name of which conceives and
runs.</i>

1106
02:24:09,940 --> 02:24:11,940
<i>Individual human life.</i>

1107
02:24:12,930 --> 02:24:17,620
<i>Perhaps the idea is there, they keep
minutes of doubt in previous years,</i>

1108
02:24:17,820 --> 02:24:22,020
<i>If not trivialize, and realized the
beauty and harshness of the real
world.</i>

1109
02:24:22,460 --> 02:24:25,050
<i>He lived as man should live and man.</i>

1110
02:24:26,580 --> 02:24:30,030
<i>Today is a consequence of the day
yesterday,</i>

1111
02:24:30,470 --> 02:24:33,580
<i>Why tomorrow is created today.</i>

1112
02:24:33,730 --> 02:24:36,580
<i>Then why not been those tractor
sleds?</i>

1113
02:24:36,820 --> 02:24:40,150
<i>And not your face that freezing cold
February wind.</i>

1114
02:24:40,830 --> 02:24:44,130
<i>Where were you?
What you've done all these years?</i>

1115
02:24:44,400 --> 02:24:46,450
<i>Are you happy with yourself?</i>

1116
02:24:46,650 --> 02:24:50,590
<i>Dedicated to our parents, who
finalized postwar dream.</i>

1117
02:24:50,740 --> 02:24:53,000
<i>A large and peaceful happy life.</i>
