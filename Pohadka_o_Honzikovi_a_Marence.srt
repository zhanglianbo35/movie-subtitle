2
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,677
Karel Zeman to children.

3
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:39,797
Tale about Honzik and Marenka

4
00:02:13,558 --> 00:02:17,670
Breathlessly we examine work of old chroniclers.

5
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:23,354
With an admiration we look at pages
touched by their diligence.

6
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,839
They wrote about magnificent battles,
great kings and exceptional generals.

7
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:33,240
Winners often led hand of chroniclers
by strong hand.

8
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:36,824
And these wrote on pergamen so colorful,

9
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:41,308
that their acts were crowned
by an immortal fame.

10
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:46,731
They wrote all chronicle about great of greatest,

11
00:02:47,163 --> 00:02:52,198
and there was no pergamen left
for the little ones.

12
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,464
That's why we don't know

13
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,593
almost nothing

14
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:01,176
about the smallest.

15
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,755
Our little hero had a name Honzik.

16
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,915
There was nothing about him in old chronicles,

17
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:16,582
however, we know that
he was born on the same day,

18
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:21,171
when another Honzik,
great knight and king John I of Bohemia,

19
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:25,272
fell bravely at the battle of Crecy.

20
00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:33,361
And on the exact day near Buchlov,

21
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,085
huge oak fell.

22
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,638
It was healthy and strong tree.

23
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,201
A poor sheperd made a cradle

24
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,235
for his little Honzik from that tree.

25
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,665
And so it all began...

26
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,970
There were standing
three weird sisters next to the cradle.

27
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,130
That was a habit then.

28
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:02,236
In addition to blessing
he got a present from each of them.

29
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:07,586
First weird sister gave him little guardian dwarf
in the form of white mouse.

30
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:11,089
Second weird sister
gave him a black mouse.

31
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,534
And third gave him
a gray mouse.

32
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,986
When weird sisters were gone,
mice changed to dwarves,

33
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:27,162
and they should have protect him
for the whole life.

34
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:35,510
First dwarf was very good
and saw the world only good and beautiful.

35
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:41,070
The black one was an imp and trickster.

36
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:45,623
And the last one was a little smiley and
a little easy-going.

37
00:05:47,203 --> 00:05:50,796
Since then Honzik was under their protection.

38
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:56,684
But only he saw them
when they advised him what to do.

39
00:05:57,408 --> 00:06:00,739
They were invisible for other people.

40
00:06:06,486 --> 00:06:10,451
Even when he had grown up,
the dwarves were still looking at him.

41
00:06:10,857 --> 00:06:14,852
They watched each of his movements,
each of his thoughts.

42
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:37,450
Honzik, do you see?
The world is big and beautiful.

43
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:39,634
What are you waiting for?

44
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,394
Home is best.

45
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:47,093
You'll get rotten at home.

46
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:50,900
But you'll keep up
your worried parents.

47
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:53,834
You won't help them
out of poorness here.

48
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:59,015
Honzik, you're their only joy,
don't leave them.

49
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:02,562
When you're back rich,
you'll give them plenty of money.

50
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:07,665
The world is full of traps,
you can encounter some unhappiness.

51
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:09,756
Or hapinness.

52
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:13,506
Nobody is waiting there for you,
what will you do there?

53
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,956
Look at his nose
how beautiful it is after sting.

54
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:15,788
I got him, see.

55
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,860
Oh, my nose.

56
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:36,166
Mercy, generous man,

57
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:38,533
don't give me to soldiers,

58
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,799
have a mercy.

59
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:45,091
Just give the rascal to them,
he threw rope on your neck.

60
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:48,214
Be merciful, forgive him.

61
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,128
Mercy, I have a wife
and children.

62
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:55,310
See, you have an oportunity
to do something noble.

63
00:10:55,595 --> 00:11:00,167
Give him to them, don't think about it.
They're coming.

64
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:24,038
Boy, we're looking for
a dangerous thug.

65
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:26,949
Haven't you seen
someone suspicious?

66
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:32,179
Somewhere here at the big tree.

67
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:34,036
He kills wanderers.

68
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,284
Hold the horses.

69
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:41,351
We'll look through
the bush around.

70
00:11:41,205 --> 00:11:42,607
The rascal has to be there.

71
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,274
Quickly on horses.
We'll run away.

72
00:12:01,652 --> 00:12:05,760
They can't catch us by foot.
And thug on the horse...!

73
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:08,126
We'll be masters of all roads.

74
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:13,742
Honzik, don't go a wrong way.
It leads to hell.

75
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:16,371
We'll be companions.

76
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:18,912
We'll share.

77
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,306
We'll have plenty of money.

78
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,430
You can't!

79
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:28,136
Let him try.
It's only a little ride on horse.

80
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,087
Nobody's here.
Let's go back.

81
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:34,951
Don't hesitate.
Quickly, until it's time.

82
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,215
Have some.

83
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:39,634
Honzik, hands off the can,
brandy is a doom.

84
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:42,211
Small gulp
is good for health.

85
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:45,540
No, listen to my voice,
before it's too late.

86
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:49,874
Let him sleep,
he has no fun with you.

87
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:53,515
You don't let him
even one gulp.

88
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,195
I hear a wagon.

89
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:02,965
I see it now.

90
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:05,321
A chariot of nobleman.

91
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:08,697
We're lucky
at the beginning.

92
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:11,152
To catch so fat loot.

93
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:14,375
We'll surprise them
after they enter the forest.

94
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,733
Hold!
Money or life!

95
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:51,796
Welcome master knight.
Everyone out! Quickly!

96
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:58,996
Just come here master knight
and you precious lady,
so I can ease you from gold.

97
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:45,620
Your turn, beautiful.
Jewels, trinkets, bracelets, all to me.

98
00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:54,936
Honzik, it's still time to stop it.
Remember your good education.

99
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:58,932
Hurry up arrogant chicken,
or I'll dress you off.

100
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:05,331
Honzik, don't let hurt the weak lady.
Poor woman.

101
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:22,289
Here you have, rascal.

102
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:29,424
Give it here,
or you'll get one too.

103
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:53,273
Master knight, commander of guards
reports to your protection.

104
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,087
Too late,
I handled it alone.

105
00:18:04,782 --> 00:18:10,573
I drove the bunch of thieves to escape
and I beat up their commander.

106
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:40,232
She has canceled engagement.
There will be no marriage.

107
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:52,286
Turn it back and go home.
To mummy.

108
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:08,969
Guards, tie the thief up.
So that he can't escape.

109
00:19:11,435 --> 00:19:16,142
He's innocent.
I swear he's innocent.

110
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:26,184
What will be with him?

111
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:28,920
He'll be hanged.

112
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,484
Hunted knight and his company
quickly ride to the safe castle Beranov.

113
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:27,045
Everyone there expects impatiently
arrival of young knight and his bride.

114
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:34,928
Cresty knight Matej Beran from Beranov is looking
forward to his son at most.

115
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:40,335
Desired bride should provide
continuation of famous house.

116
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,176
House which is
as famous as indebted.

117
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:48,981
Old knight is very worried
and he should be.

118
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:55,628
He indebted family castle so much,
that only rich bride could save it.

119
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:57,564
They're coming.

120
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:58,527
There was no bride
and so there were no guests.

121
00:21:59,337 --> 00:22:05,923
There were only last two descendents
of famous house of Beran.

122
00:22:10,356 --> 00:22:19,080
Noble father, I've returned from bloody battle.
Thousands of poisonous arrows hit my face.

123
00:22:19,498 --> 00:22:22,958
Where is your bride, my son?

124
00:22:23,497 --> 00:22:28,843
We were attacked by thugs in the forest.

125
00:22:29,396 --> 00:22:33,280
I fought, I beat them.

126
00:22:33,696 --> 00:22:39,392
I captured their commander.
But when the bees helped him, he escaped.

127
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,968
With your bride?

128
00:22:43,815 --> 00:22:51,769
Our standard must not get dirty.
We have to capture him, dead or alive.

129
00:22:52,678 --> 00:22:56,730
Arms!

130
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:51,985
Do you hear? Hunting horns.
This is how hunt for a fox begins.

131
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:56,552
You got it.
But the fox is our Honzik this time.

132
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:59,814
Whose conscience is clean,
must not fear.

133
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:04,719
I know better one.
Who escapes, wins.

134
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:13,593
Don't worry Honzik.
We're with you.

135
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,366
Advise me then.
Where can I find the one I love?

136
00:31:18,772 --> 00:31:22,195
You are all silent now.

137
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,577
Where can I find her?

138
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,272
I'll tell.
She lives on an island of dreams.

139
00:31:28,543 --> 00:31:31,139
But common mortal can't get there.

140
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:34,085
Unless he has wings.

141
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:35,993
Lend me your wings.

142
00:31:36,856 --> 00:31:40,043
My wings?
You would have to be an angel.

143
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:41,644
Or a devil.

144
00:31:42,175 --> 00:31:44,194
So lend me your wings you, imp

145
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:49,281
But the wings will be black.
I don't have other.

146
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,209
I don't care the color.

147
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:57,001
Great, since now you're mine
and you'll listen only to my advices.

148
00:31:57,394 --> 00:32:03,450
Don't listen to him.
You'll subsribe to bad powers and you'll pity it after.

149
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,619
She worths it.

150
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:14,916
She doesn't. She's nymph, fairy,
she can't do cakes or dumplings for you.

151
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,664
She'll learn it then.

152
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:26,090
Nobody wants your advises, grandad,
stop the lectures or I'll pluck up your beard.

153
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:06,463
Send the two away.

154
00:33:08,212 --> 00:33:11,270
Get out.
I don't want to see you anymore.

155
00:33:12,695 --> 00:33:16,705
You're banishing your friends, Honzik.
Pity.

156
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:24,949
I follow you through day and night.
Look, my shoes are cracked.

157
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:28,239
What's up with the wings?

158
00:34:29,612 --> 00:34:31,558
What are you waiting for?

159
00:34:31,963 --> 00:34:35,422
When the time is right,
you'll have them.

160
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:58,499
Choose, so you can be showed
as true knight.

161
00:35:24,075 --> 00:35:29,467
What do you want to do with the flower?
A fight is coming, Honzik.

162
00:37:16,496 --> 00:37:19,019
Very well, Honzik.

163
00:37:58,164 --> 00:38:03,733
In the distance there
a crystal palace rises up from fog.

164
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:06,792
The palace of dreams,
place of forest nymphs.

165
00:38:07,163 --> 00:38:11,255
There you can find your beautiful.

166
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,753
I beg you only for that.

167
00:38:41,131 --> 00:38:43,073
Why do you want to leave us?

168
00:38:43,608 --> 00:38:48,100
I would like to return among people.
I want to be a living being.

169
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:51,134
I don't want to be
only a fairy tale being.

170
00:38:51,785 --> 00:38:54,227
You're living like in a beautiful dream
among us.

171
00:38:54,847 --> 00:38:58,934
And the world you're hasting into
is an evil world.

172
00:38:59,709 --> 00:39:03,018
I know, but in the world
is also a joy

173
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:05,971
love and happiness.

174
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:08,829
And if they last a short while

175
00:39:09,157 --> 00:39:12,899
it's worth to live there.

176
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:17,966
Let it happen according to your wish.
Live and suffer.

177
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:25,684
But you can't return
among us.

178
00:39:27,495 --> 00:39:29,390
On your way among people

179
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,066
I give you a beautiful girl name.

180
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:34,151
Marenka.

181
00:39:42,057 --> 00:39:44,788
I want to have wings
immediately.

182
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:47,016
You will.

183
00:39:47,381 --> 00:39:49,973
But don't forget our deal.

184
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:51,616
I agree.

185
00:39:52,169 --> 00:39:54,122
I want to be near her.

186
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:56,075
In her world.

187
00:40:03,389 --> 00:40:07,376
Thanks dear friend,
I'll try them now.

188
00:40:11,948 --> 00:40:13,764
Wave the wings.

189
00:40:14,056 --> 00:40:15,931
Don't fall down.

190
00:41:37,112 --> 00:41:41,247
She has turned into human being
and has gone to seek you.

191
00:41:41,578 --> 00:41:43,276
You can't follow her.

192
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:45,375
Look.

193
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,821
Stay with us.

194
00:42:01,129 --> 00:42:03,200
You belong
to our world now.

195
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:05,676
You can't go back
among people.

196
00:42:06,027 --> 00:42:09,503
They would be affraid of you.
Stay.

197
00:42:30,106 --> 00:42:31,565
Imp!

198
00:42:33,354 --> 00:42:36,466
Devil!
Where are you?

199
00:42:37,286 --> 00:42:39,698
Come near,
you traitor!

200
00:42:40,695 --> 00:42:42,999
Come here, come.

201
00:42:44,536 --> 00:42:46,044
Why do you call me?

202
00:42:46,343 --> 00:42:48,029
I'm not supposed
to protect you anymore.

203
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:51,305
Now you're a being
from the other world as me.

204
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:53,298
We're colleagues.

205
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,335
Give me back my human look.

206
00:42:56,587 --> 00:43:00,170
That's not possible.
No one can change face as he wants.

207
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:01,928
You've got what you wanted.

208
00:43:03,523 --> 00:43:05,963
I've done it for my love.

209
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,136
Help me once more.

210
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,030
I want to be a human again.

211
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:14,477
Surely, it can't be done.

212
00:43:15,184 --> 00:43:17,180
The only thing that
can help you is a miracle.

213
00:43:17,544 --> 00:43:19,571
That is out of my power.

214
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:33,579
Honzik!

215
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,383
Welcome, good people.

216
00:45:33,951 --> 00:45:36,181
Haven't you seen Honzik here?

217
00:45:36,632 --> 00:45:38,422
We're looking for him too.

218
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:40,949
Bandit!

219
00:45:48,989 --> 00:45:52,274
Introduce yourself,
he'll accompany you to the castle.

220
00:45:52,662 --> 00:45:54,957
We'll handle you there.

221
00:46:05,663 --> 00:46:10,534
I'm singing my singing

222
00:46:11,116 --> 00:46:16,183
the most desire i know

223
00:46:16,952 --> 00:46:22,067
after the first meeting

224
00:46:22,498 --> 00:46:27,991
with full-moon and with him

225
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:34,017
I'm singing my singing

226
00:46:34,657 --> 00:46:39,163
into the clouds and far

227
00:46:39,826 --> 00:46:45,337
after the happy meeting

228
00:46:45,768 --> 00:46:49,892
with one who took my rest.

229
00:46:51,259 --> 00:46:56,207
I'm singing what i know

230
00:46:56,993 --> 00:47:01,183
I won't tell you more

231
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:08,120
I'm singing my singing

232
00:47:09,031 --> 00:47:13,662
how much I love you

233
00:47:14,194 --> 00:47:19,229
under the star pot

234
00:47:19,676 --> 00:47:24,920
you're not alone

235
00:47:25,549 --> 00:47:30,671
I'm singing my singing

236
00:47:31,133 --> 00:47:36,286
before I fall asleep

237
00:47:36,746 --> 00:47:41,603
my heart is on my palm

238
00:47:42,147 --> 00:47:49,429
it's the most anyone can give.

239
00:48:06,408 --> 00:48:10,639
For the eternal fame of our house,
we'll organize a tournament.

240
00:48:11,146 --> 00:48:14,457
A big chivalrous tournament.

241
00:48:15,367 --> 00:48:21,738
We'll invite all famous knights
to fight for the most precious gem we have.

242
00:48:22,517 --> 00:48:24,509
For Marenka.

243
00:48:26,886 --> 00:48:28,676
Marenka.

244
00:48:29,024 --> 00:48:32,300
She's got a beauty of a flower
and golden in her throat.

245
00:48:37,407 --> 00:48:40,036
You prepare a horse
and an armour too

246
00:48:40,407 --> 00:48:42,231
so you'll show yourself.

247
00:48:51,503 --> 00:48:55,319
From a castle to a castle flew a message
about the great tournament

248
00:48:55,905 --> 00:49:00,023
 and about a beauty of a charming girl 
for the winner.

249
00:49:01,013 --> 00:49:04,207
Noble knights of the whole kingdom
seddled horses

250
00:49:04,454 --> 00:49:06,330
and sharpened swords

251
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:09,659
to fight about a win
and a knight fame.

252
00:49:18,085 --> 00:49:21,294
Ones came with full shine of their armour

253
00:49:21,673 --> 00:49:24,043
sure of winning before the fight.

254
00:49:24,891 --> 00:49:28,996
Others, more carefull,
was saving strength of their horses

255
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:33,079
until the decisive moment of the fight.

256
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,788
Look.

257
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:08,485
The most brave knights of the whole land
will fight about you.

258
00:50:09,656 --> 00:50:14,930
Everyone in hope of adding some fame
to their coat of arms.

259
00:50:15,378 --> 00:50:18,969
The winner of the tournament
will gain you

260
00:50:19,343 --> 00:50:21,253
as a first prize.

261
00:50:45,682 --> 00:50:48,907
Look, it begins.

262
00:53:27,106 --> 00:53:28,969
Quickly, up.

263
00:53:29,621 --> 00:53:31,940
Quickly, pull.

264
00:53:50,532 --> 00:53:55,485
Noble sir father
sends you a knight armour.

265
00:53:57,101 --> 00:54:00,248
Against falling stones?

266
00:54:00,786 --> 00:54:04,083
For the tournament, sir knight.

267
00:54:05,405 --> 00:54:06,801
I won't go.

268
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:08,341
No?

269
00:54:09,867 --> 00:54:14,240
I'm injured,
wholly stabbed.

270
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:19,111
They're waiting for you
at the tournament, sir knight.

271
00:54:35,123 --> 00:54:37,858
Borrow me your armour,
quickly.

272
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,174
Finally, my son is here.

273
00:55:24,816 --> 00:55:26,905
Hooray.

274
00:55:27,535 --> 00:55:31,306
My brave son, 
knight without fear and shame

275
00:55:32,112 --> 00:55:33,991
has won.

276
00:55:39,268 --> 00:55:46,298
Is there anyone next
who dares to overcome famous house of Beran?

277
00:56:56,286 --> 00:56:57,836
Clapping.

278
00:57:02,242 --> 00:57:07,019
The best knight of the tournament
has won.

279
00:57:07,407 --> 00:57:13,514
My brave son Ignac Beran z Beranu.

280
00:57:14,234 --> 00:57:16,855
Long live Ignac!

281
00:57:17,696 --> 00:57:20,402
Are you calling me,
my noble father?

282
00:57:24,686 --> 00:57:28,964
I'm in the bed, you know, 
sick, stabbed.

283
00:57:45,916 --> 00:57:48,947
Close the gate.
Catch him!

284
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,705
Shoot!

285
00:58:13,229 --> 00:58:17,683
Shoot him down! Shoot!

286
00:58:44,865 --> 00:58:47,353
Look. He's flew down there.

287
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:49,255
There.

288
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:04,059
Noble sir knight,
I report dutifully

289
00:59:04,564 --> 00:59:08,453
Rascal!
Coward!

290
00:59:07,694 --> 00:59:10,917
Dodger!
Chicken-heart!

291
00:59:11,338 --> 00:59:14,399
I report dutifully
that shot enemy fell into wood.

292
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:16,596
We hit him.

293
00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:20,842
Injured?

294
00:59:21,352 --> 00:59:24,731
We'll get him now.
We'll have our revenge.

295
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:32,831
I'm calling you all to fight,
brave knights.

296
00:59:33,685 --> 00:59:38,940
That will be forever written down
and immortally famous

297
00:59:39,251 --> 00:59:41,989
who will kill the arrogant kidnapper.

298
00:59:43,502 --> 00:59:45,435
Hooray to the fight.

299
00:59:45,765 --> 00:59:47,423
Hooray!

300
00:59:47,874 --> 00:59:49,989
Hooray!

301
01:02:12,086 --> 01:02:13,779
Hooray.

302
01:03:05,097 --> 01:03:07,187
Honzik, we're back.

303
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:10,819
Honzik and Marenka, come.

304
01:03:26,496 --> 01:03:30,840
The best of the whole kingdom
were chasing the fugitives.

305
01:03:31,468 --> 01:03:34,479
With thud of heels, with clashes of armours,
shields and coat of arms

306
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,507
ran for their chivalrous fame.

307
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:41,691
So that chroniclers
could write about something.

308
01:03:42,229 --> 01:03:45,529
And they were writing and wrting

309
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:47,835
until they ran out of parchments.

310
01:03:48,279 --> 01:03:51,924
That's why in the old chronicles
love and human hapiness

311
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:55,215
didn't get its place.

312
01:03:55,715 --> 01:04:00,773
Brave Honzik and beautiful Marenka
got written into another books.

313
01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:05,987
Into the most beautiful in the world.

314
01:04:06,566 --> 01:04:09,493
Into childy fairy tales.
