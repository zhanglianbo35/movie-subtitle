1
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,135
荷兰的犹太人不再被允许踏入公园散步
DUTCH JEWS ARE NO LONGER ALLOWED
TO WALK IN PARKS

2
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,412
也不许进餐馆和公立学校
OR GO TO RESTAURANTS
OR STATE SCHOOLS.

3
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,500
被剥夺自由,被种族隔离，
绝大多数人接受了他们的命运
DEPRIVED OF THEIR FREEDOM AND
SEGREGATED, MOST ACCEPT THEIR FATE

4
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,409
希望这种耻辱是能发生的最坏的事
IN THE HOPE THAT THE HUMILIATION
IS THE WORST THAT WILL HAPPEN.

5
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:10,754
泰兹勒，我希望周一开始，在正午以前
Tazelaar, I want it started up
by Monday, before noon.

6
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,700
维护可以在C13实施
Maintenance can be carried out on C13.

7
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:17,066
Den Daas.

8
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:20,783
那些文书已经分类了
谢谢你
That transfer has been sorted out.
Thank you.

9
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,977
不要忘了医生的嘱托
好的
Don't forget the doctor's note.
OK.

10
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:25,306
一切顺利！
Have a nice day.

11
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,697
苏斯坎德先生？
Mr Silskind?

12
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,543
主管想要见你
The director would like to see you.

13
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,753
不能等到周一吗
Can't it wait till Monday?

14
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:30,371
爸爸！爸爸！
Daddy! Daddy!

15
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,616
是谁的生日呀?
我的
Whose birthday is it?
Mine.

16
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:36,453
你看起来真可爱
You look so pretty.

17
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:40,548
好的孩子们，穿上外套
OK kids, coats on.
Paul, Saar, Anne, Lou.

18
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:42,796
你有点迟到了
You're a bit late.

19
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:45,484
她是你的女儿
She is your daughter, you know.

20
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:46,997
谁要去厕所？
Who needs the toilet?

21
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:53,727
快点
好的
Hurry up.
Yeah.

22
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,292
我原本也应该呆在德国的。
是的，但你现在在阿姆斯特丹。
I might as well have stayed in Germany.
Yes, but you're in Amsterdam now.

23
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:01,128
但是要待多久呢？这全部的一切
走向何方呢？
But for how long
and where's it all leading?

24
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:04,199
去礼堂(剧院)。
你正开车带孩子们去那儿，现在
To the theatre.
And you're driving the kids there, now.

25
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:05,609
没开车？
Without a car?

26
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:09,943
是的
Yeah...

27
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,968
那么我们步行吧
Then we'll walk.

28
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:17,800
我因为那些杂碎而离开，
那个臭名昭著的国家
I leave that stinking country
because of that bastard

29
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:20,039
他在尾随我
狗娘养的
and he follows me!
The son of a bitch.

30
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,172
掐掉了你的工作
真卑鄙
To pinch your job,
how mean!

31
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:26,228
沃尔特，如果那是发生的最坏的情况
Walter, if that's
the worst thing that happens...

32
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:29,022
大家都在吗？
来，亲爱的
ls everyone here?
Come on, sweetheart.

33
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:32,259
犹太人
JEWS ONLY

34
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:34,550
来，孩子们
Come on, kids.

35
00:04:34,894 --> 00:04:38,489
你拿到了吗？
是的，拿回给Dark Ages
Have you got it with you?
Yes, back to the Dark Ages.

36
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:45,128
Silskind一家
The Silskind family.

37
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,964
7个人
Seven people.

38
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,610
你来一个吗？赛亚？
保罗
Do you want one, Saartje?
Paul.

39
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:32,120
威登希尔，克里斯安？
是的
Vreugdenhil, Christiaan?
Yes.

40
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:38,122
你也在演出现场吗？
我是钢琴师
Are you in the show too?
I'm the pianist.

41
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:40,844
犹太人？
不。
Jewish?
No.

42
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:43,718
跟我来
怎么了？我不是犹太人
Come with me.
What's going on? I'm not Jewish.

43
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:47,878
长官，你不能那么对待艾瑞斯
Officer, you can't treat
Aryans like that.

44
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,603
你在这儿干什么？
What are you doing here?

45
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,558
我在这儿看滑稽剧。
让他弹钢琴。
I'm here for the revue.
Let him play the piano.

46
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,291
跟你们有什么关系？
What business is it of yours?

47
00:05:56,555 --> 00:06:00,833
作为一个德国人，我一直为穿制服的
德国人而骄傲，就像你
As a German, I'm always proud
of Germans in uniform, like you.

48
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,706
绝对正确
Always correct.

49
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:07,551
请拿纸。
Papers, please.

50
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:10,766
给你
Here you are.

51
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:14,353
Mr Silskind?
Yes.

52
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:17,512
请稍等
Wait here.

53
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,655
Mister...
先生

54
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:51,044
不错的材料
A nice piece of rough.

55
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:58,520
如果你想出售，我老板有办法
If you want to sell it,
my boss will know what to do with it.

56
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:00,677
你还在工作？
You still have a job?

57
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,590
你没被解雇吗？
我运气不错
You didn't get fired?
I got lucky.

58
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:07,108
你不必去德国了？
我可以呆在阿姆斯特丹。
You don't have to go to Germany?
I can stay in Amsterdam.

59
00:07:07,456 --> 00:07:09,970
我拿到了一个SPERRE证
别管我为什么
I've got a Sperre.
Don't ask me why.

60
00:07:11,252 --> 00:07:14,290
这不是德国佬那里来的。
不是，来自犹太人理事会
It's not from the Krauts.
No, the Jewish Council.

61
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,339
把你的白布条，分类一下。
你能找个那样的吗？
Get your white rag, sorted.
Can you get one just like that?

62
00:07:19,092 --> 00:07:20,765
哦，不是那样的...
Well, not just like that...

63
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:24,091
你可能得为他们工作
你在担心什么呢？
You probably have to work for them.
What are you worrying about?

64
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:26,468
如果你能在阿姆斯特丹谋生
If you can earn a living,
here in Amsterdam

65
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:29,997
在这儿骑你的自行车，在这儿自由呼吸
在阿姆斯特丹
and ride your bike here and breathe
the air here, in Amsterdam...

66
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:34,430
你自己擦屁股好了关我什么事呢
You can wipe your arse
with that rag for all I care.

67
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:37,251
至少我不必去酸菜佬的地方
At least I don't have to go
to Krautland.

68
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:53,289
西蒙，来
Simon, come on.

69
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:58,472
你在这儿干什么呢
你家住哪儿啊？
What are you doing here,
where do you live?

70
00:07:58,797 --> 00:08:00,356
你坐在这等谁呢
What are you sitting there for?

71
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:04,341
过来，你要把我逼疯了
我的鞋子里有个石头
Come here, you're driving me crazy.
There was a stone in my shoe.

72
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:10,843
当心！警察！
Watch out, a cop!

73
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:16,614
请出示证件
我住在这儿
Papers, please.
I live here.

74
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,410
鲁斯，鲁斯，来这儿。
Roos! Roos, come here!

75
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:19,806
逃走，鲁斯。
闭嘴
Go away, Roos.
Shut up!

76
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:21,713
滚开，你个肮脏的犹太人
Go away, you stinking Jew!

77
00:08:21,986 --> 00:08:23,135
爸爸
Daddy!

78
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:49,642
战争会结束的，会有那一天的
Some day the war will end.

79
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:55,261
然后，她将去上学
她会活下来
And then she will go to school,
and she will live

80
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:57,077
她还会结婚
and she will get married.

81
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,323
我们会成为爷爷和奶奶
And we will be
a grandpa and grandma.

82
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:03,366
你会是个伟大的爷爷
You'll make a great grandpa.

83
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,636
汉娜，你愿意答应我一件事吗？
Hanna,
will you promise me something?

84
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:11,636
你愿意永远和我在一起吗
Will you stay with me always?

85
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,099
无论发生任何事
Whatever happens?

86
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:24,466
犹太人理事会
JEWISH COUNCIL

87
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,471
劳驾，劳驾
EXCUSE me, EXCUSE me.

88
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:52,975
劳驾，劳驾，劳驾
EXCUSE me, EXCUSE me, EXCUSE me.

89
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:11,492
早上好
Good morning.

90
00:10:32,443 --> 00:10:37,074
你已经来了，珀拉克先生.
会占用一小会时间，请跟我来
You're already here, Mr Polak.
It may take a while, but follow me.

91
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:38,563
谢谢
Thank you.

92
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:43,705
坦白说，我从没自己来过某个德国工厂
To be honest, I don't see myself
in some German factory.

93
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,435
当然你将被免除检查，
只要你是这里不可或缺的人
You'll be exempted, surely.
As long as you're indispensable here.

94
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:51,421
你，我...
我现在在哪儿?
You, me...
Now, where was I?

95
00:10:51,795 --> 00:10:56,471
哦,吐根医生和他的家人
他们可以被排除
Ah, Dr.Tugendhafi and his family,
they can be removed.

96
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:59,314
医生真地是不可或缺
Doctors really are indispensable.

97
00:10:59,844 --> 00:11:04,236
我们很幸运绅士们可以有权选择驱逐谁
We're lucky the gentlemen are allowed
to choose who has to be deported.

98
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:05,756
不是德国人?
不是
Not the Germans?
No.

99
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:09,089
他们只是说一个数量
我们自由决定是谁
They just say how many.
We're free to choose who.

100
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:11,474
设想一下报传票的情形
Imagine getting
a summons to report.

101
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:15,481
你不能报,他们会来抓你
You could not report in.
Then they'll come and get you.

102
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,246
艾尔小姐,是我搞错了还是这里有新来的人
Miss Elzas, am I mistaken
or is that someone new?

103
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,124
那是珀拉克先生,来自理事会
他来这整理名单
That's Mr Polak from the Expo.
He is here for the lists.

104
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:23,405
啊,名单
Ah, the lists!

105
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:26,811
猜猜我们已经从名单上排除多少个了
Guess how many we've managed
to remove from the list.

106
00:11:27,162 --> 00:11:29,597
布莱姆,或许珀拉克先生不喜欢猜谜语
Bram, perhaps Mr Polak
doesn't like riddles?

107
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:33,385
14000,他们全有Sperre证。
谁也料不到吧?
14,000, all of them a Sperre.
Who would have thought?

108
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:36,710
实话说,你料到了吗?珀拉克先生?
Did you expect that, Mr Polak?
Be honest.

109
00:11:37,088 --> 00:11:40,126
没有,我以为最多是10000或者12000
No. Ten, maybe.
Twelve, at the most.

110
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,377
今天上午,我们跟党卫军喝咖啡了
This morning,
we had coffee with the SS.

111
00:11:42,677 --> 00:11:44,827
我必须得说,咖啡棒极了
Excellent coffee,
I must say.

112
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:49,131
突然,那个费尔长官先生问...
Suddenly, that Mr Aus der Filnten asks...
Hauptsturmï¬‚lhrer Aus der Filnten.

113
00:11:49,517 --> 00:11:52,430
他问理事会要多少人
He asks how many people
the Council needs

114
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,489
一年之内装上火车
to get everyone on the train
within a year.

115
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:58,010
那是他说的话.
我说20000
That's what he says.
I say twenty thousand.

116
00:11:58,358 --> 00:12:02,317
在商言商,你要求20000,实际能得到14000
Once a businessman always a businessman
You ask for 20, you get 14.

117
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:07,194
像老鼠一样,艾斯先生.
我们像阴沟里的爬鼠一样.
Like rats, Mr Asscher.
We're walking into the trap like rats.

118
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:09,252
科奇先生,这真的是唯一的办法
Mr Kisch,
this really is the only way.

119
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:13,450
这真是堕落
我们要成为纳粹的帮凶吗
A slippery slope.
Do we want to become the Nazis' slaves?

120
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:15,629
我们有使命在身
接受现实吧
Is that our mission?
Adapting.

121
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,029
我们因为接受现实已经苟活了2000年
We've survived
for 2,000 years by adapting.

122
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:20,766
这会是上帝最后的诅咒
This could, God forbid,
be the last time.

123
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:23,477
请坐,科奇先生
坐下?
Please sit down, Mr Kisch.
Sit down?

124
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,139
你的名字在那儿吗?珀拉克先生?
Is your name on there, Mr Polak?

125
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:09,267
苏斯坎德是我的名字.沃尔特.苏斯坎德
Silskind is my name, Walter Silskind.

126
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:10,663
Sluzker.

127
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:13,568
你想要被排除,我理解
And you would like to be removed?
I understand.

128
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:16,039
但是我恐怕不能帮你,抱歉
But I'm afraid I can't help you.
Sorry.

129
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:19,702
听着,你应该知道我有相当重要的工作经验
Listen, you should know
I have considerable work experience.

130
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:22,655
装载1000乘客的船已经裂缝
A ship with 1,000 passengers
has sprung a leak

131
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:25,973
救生艇只有能搭载50人的空间
and there is only room
for 50 in the lifeboat.

132
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:27,925
其余的950人怎么办?
What about the other 950?

133
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,806
他们就该死吗?
They're just allowed to perish?

134
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:36,479
我从38就在霍格文的克虏伯家族工作
I worked at Krupp.
And since '38 at Hoogovens.

135
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:40,096
你要明白,一周之内我在此不可或缺
You'll see, I'll be indispensable here
within a week.

136
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,246
作为一个钢琴师?
As a pianist?

137
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:46,853
我也会踢踏舞.
我是个公司经理,很称职
I can tap dance too.
I'm a company manager, a good one.

138
00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:52,965
荷兰礼堂(剧院)
DUTCH THEATRE

139
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:03,061
157,694张卡片

140
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:06,405
德语.
复式簿记
The German way.
Double-entry bookkeeping.

141
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:09,408
这是一张名单上每个人名的卡片
There's a card
for every name on the list.

142
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:11,220
Watertight.

143
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,880
Felix.

144
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:20,229
Felix Halverstad.
After the war he'll be an artist again.
战后,他将重新做一个艺术家.

145
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:25,295
他们等着被拉去西波克集中营
They wait here for transportation
to Westerbork camp.

146
00:14:25,707 --> 00:14:29,382
他们不能直达吗?
一次性去140000人?
Can't they go straight there?
140,000 people on a train in one go?

147
00:14:29,878 --> 00:14:32,313
你一周发送两次
You send them twice a week,

148
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,985
一次400或500人
400 or 500 people at a time.

149
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,620
这儿是厕所
Here is the toilet.

150
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,654
一个厕所?你知道一个家庭一天的排泄物得多少吗?
One toilet? Do you know how much
waste matter a family produces in a day?

151
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,369
400或500个家庭
这里没有家庭和孩子
Times 400 or 500 families...
No families or children here.

152
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:47,080
德国人不想听抱怨
The Germans don't like whining.

153
00:14:47,394 --> 00:14:49,590
你让他们在哪儿?
那儿.
Where do you keep them then?
There.

154
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:54,175
在犹太教会堂?
那是收留儿童的地方.
In the synagogue?
That's where the children are housed.

155
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:57,321
扔掉经书,你已经变成一个
Get rid of the Torah
and you've got a crÃ©che.

156
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,616
党卫军相当机警
The SS are certainly resourceful.

157
00:15:00,907 --> 00:15:04,025
所以把孩子隔离了
So the children are separated
from the parents upon arrival?

158
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:07,487
带来这儿,是的
堕落.
And brought here, yes.
The slippery slope.

159
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:11,066
你仍然还可以拒绝这个职务
并归还袖章
You can still refuse the position
and return the armband.

160
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:14,170
我们会在这儿见到你.
你的孩子在这儿.
We'll see you here anyway.
Your child here.

161
00:15:14,587 --> 00:15:18,182
你和你的妻子站在前排穿过街道.
让我们知道.
You across the street with your wife
in the front row stalls. Let me know.

162
00:15:31,144 --> 00:15:32,782
那么做想干什么?
What do you want with that?

163
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:34,895
逃跑,藏匿
To escape. Hide.

164
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:38,588
你已经疯了吗?如果他们抓住我们,
他们会送我们去毛特豪森
Have you gone mad? If they catch us,
they'll send us to Mauthausen.

165
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:42,732
那是你想要的吗?你的女儿在集中营?
藏匿是禁止的
Is that what you want? Your daughter
in a prison camp? Hiding is forbidden!

166
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:53,102
沃尔特,我为你骄傲.
我们得到了一个Sperre证
Walter, I'm so proud of you.
We've got a Sperre.

167
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:56,370
是的，如果我接受作为纳粹傀儡的工作
Yes, if I take that job
as the Nazi's stooge.

168
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,941
如果你不接受，会有10，20，,100个别的人做。
If you don't, there'll be ten others
who will. Twenty, a hundred.

169
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:01,935
一定有人做.
为什么?
Someone has to do it.
Why?

170
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:04,776
为什么我们必须离开?
我们是守法的荷兰公民.
Why must we leave?
We're ordinary Dutch citizens.

171
00:16:05,093 --> 00:16:08,563
或许你可以诉诸于女王,只要她关心
几个犹太人的话
Maybe you can petition the Queen.
As if she cares about a few Jews.

172
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:11,961
你知道你不做这个工作会发生什么吗?
Do you know what will happen
if you don't take that job?

173
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:16,518
警察!
解散!
Police!
Get lost!

174
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,925
从后面出来
Out the back!

175
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,720
来,快跑
Come on, run!

176
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:29,602
从那儿上来
Up there!

177
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:34,588
鲁斯
Roos.
Simon, grab my hand.
抓住我的手

178
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:36,271
开着我.走
来
Look at me. Let go.
Come on.

179
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:39,461
呆在你那儿!
西蒙,往前走,鲁斯,跟他呆一起
Stay where you are!
Simon, go on. Roos, stay with him.

180
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,512
妈妈!
妈妈!
Mummy!
Mummy!

181
00:16:42,796 --> 00:16:44,912
快跑！快跑！
Run! Run!

182
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,620
早上好。
今晚在家吃吗？
Good morning.
Will you be eating at home this evening?

183
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,094
不了，谢谢
No. Thank you.

184
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:40,371
半瞎，没下巴
Half-blind. Lower-jaw gone.

185
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,897
你还是个人吗？
你说的什么话？
Are you still a human being then?
What are you talking about?

186
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:46,236
海姆特。我的哥哥
Helmut. My brother.

187
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:48,257
前排右边？
是的。
The Eastern Front?
Yes.

188
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:51,627
他被授予一等十字勋章
He was awarded
the Iron Cross First Class.

189
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:53,276
一个英雄
是的
A hero.
Yes.

190
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,374
非常不同于这里的那些给我们的荣誉抹黑的人
Quite different from those here who are
dragging our honor through the mud.

191
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,473
去中央局？
To the Central Bureau?

192
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:03,635
然后去礼堂(剧院)
是的，先生！
And then on to the theatre.
Yes, sir!

193
00:19:04,473 --> 00:19:08,546
我们的任务是什么？我们怎么处理这个任务？
What were our orders? How were we going
to take care of this task?

194
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:10,892
你记得吗？
Do you remember?

195
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:12,185
哦？
Well?

196
00:19:12,438 --> 00:19:14,395
快，排队
Quickly, orderly, thoroughly.

197
00:19:14,732 --> 00:19:16,131
怎么？洛特纳？
How? Rottenï¬‚lhrer?

198
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:19,044
Tectonically, Herr Sturmbannï¬‚lhrer.

199
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:24,721
也许事情对你来说还没明朗，但是我们毕竟不是救援军
It may not have dawned on you yet
but we're not the Salvation Army.

200
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:28,197
当家大人，是日耳曼人吗？
Beating people up in the street,
is that Teutonic?

201
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:30,255
长官不应该问责他的部下吗？
An officer shouldn't berate his men.

202
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,928
当他们打死手无寸铁的人时？
Even when they're beating
helpless people to death?

203
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,083
人？
腐败的标志。
People?
Symptoms of decay.

204
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:41,338
我再一次警告你
I'm warning you, once more

205
00:19:41,758 --> 00:19:44,398
你快要变成你哥哥的样子了
and you'll be going
where your brother went.

206
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:50,188
我们在此一起面对把这个任务顺利完成
Together we face the task
of making things run smoothly here.

207
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:52,071
预防更坏的情况发生
And prevent worse happening.

208
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:54,945
我们全都知道该提防什么人和什么事
We all know who and what
we have to be on the alert for.

209
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:58,938
忍受他们
你也如此
Tolerate them like you would a storm.
You can't do much about that either.

210
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:00,754
Yachting!

211
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:04,906
有了纪律和努力，
我们就能完成光荣的任务。
With discipline and hard work,
we can fulfill our honorable task.

212
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:11,488
豪普，我可以把你介绍给苏斯坎德先生吗？
Hauptsturmï¬‚lhrer, may I introduce you
to Mr Walter Silskind?

213
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,659
他被理事会指派来此负责
He has been appointed
by the Council to take charge here.

214
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:22,942
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen.

215
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:26,643
你们必须高效率地献身于执行此项工作。
You must execute your tasks here
with efficiency and dedication.

216
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:31,082
这是张贴在此的规则。
规则一:日耳曼政治骚乱将被严惩不贷
There are certain rules to be adhered
to. Rule number one: Teutonic regime.

217
00:20:31,472 --> 00:20:33,463
Disorder will be severely punished.

218
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:38,006
规则二：不容许哭泣或其他情绪化行为
Rule number two: Tears or other displays

219
00:20:38,395 --> 00:20:41,672

和朋友骗取特权的行为
Rule number three: Tough action
will be taken against all attempts

220
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:45,301
to fraudulently obtain privileges
for family or friends.

221
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:49,005
每个人要有贯彻执行此项工作的意识。
此项工作10个月内结束。
It is in everyone's interest
that this operation

222
00:20:49,322 --> 00:20:53,202
proceeds flawlessly
and is concluded within ten months.

223
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,105
希尔希特勒
Heil Hitler!

224
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,906
你要来那样子报告吗？
Would you come and report like that?

225
00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:08,546
如此逆来顺受？
So meekly and obediently?

226
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:12,314
说起来容易，
人们很恐惧。
That's easy for you to say,
people are scared.

227
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:16,387
他们原本应该烧掉登记表
They should have burned the registers.

228
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:20,076
然而，他们只是把表递给了酸菜佬：
“这里，150000个犹太人”
Instead they just hand them
to the Krauts. "Here, 150,000 Jews."

229
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:22,696
在德国工作...
Working in Germany...

230
00:21:24,272 --> 00:21:27,981
我是个被上帝诅咒的波兰异教徒,
I'm a godforsaken Polish pagan,

231
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:32,027
比什么都不是强,
穆斯林...
Won'h less than nothing,
the Muselmann...

232
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:36,641
他们踢我这儿,
他们踢我哪儿.
They kick me hen-2,
they kick me there.

233
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:56,661
斯古耶?
多可爱的名字呀!
Schoontje Schelvis?
What a lovely name!

234
00:21:57,012 --> 00:21:58,730
他叫什么?
布莱姆.
And what's his name?
Bram.

235
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:01,046
去苦力营?
To a labourcamp?

236
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:06,718
他甚至走不了路!
He can't even walk yet!

237
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:09,774
首先换个干净尿布,
然后睡一觉?
A clean nappy first,
and then a sleep?

238
00:22:11,943 --> 00:22:14,457
长官，够了，停止吧
Sir. That's enough now, stop.

239
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:17,973
你已经登记了吗？我能看看你的传票吗？
Have you registered yet?
Can I see your summons?

240
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:21,874
长官，请停止。
Sir, please stop.

241
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,236
听着，够了。
Listen, that's enough.

242
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:29,665
长官?
Sir?

243
00:22:30,544 --> 00:22:32,421
我想你停止。不，不。
I want you to stop. No, no.

244
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:35,443
你必须这么做吗？
Do you have to?

245
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:37,831
让我走，你个杂碎！
我可以拿你的钥匙吗？
Let me go, you bastard!
May I have your keys?

246
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:41,411
冷静点，冷静点。
什么？
Calm down, calm down.
What?

247
00:22:41,805 --> 00:22:44,274
怎么回事？
沃特曼夫人，我可以拿你的钥匙吗？
What happened?
Mrs Waterman, may I have your keys?

248
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,998
你的钥匙
Your keys.

249
00:22:47,226 --> 00:22:49,183
这个就是
你单独一个人吗?
That's it.
Are you alone?

250
00:22:49,437 --> 00:22:52,350
夫人，你是单独一人吗？
有丈夫吗？有孩子吗？
Madam, are you alone?
Husband? Children?

251
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,919
违纪记录
Disciplinary case.

252
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:57,263
你不说荷兰语吗？
比你说的好，你个肮脏的酸菜佬
Don't you speak Dutch?
Better than you, you filthy Kraut!

253
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:00,095
可能去藏起来了
Probably went into hiding.

254
00:23:00,531 --> 00:23:02,761
比例减半并立即驱逐
Rations halved
and immediate deportation.

255
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:05,954
我得出去
听着，我的孩子们...
I have to get out of here
Listen, my children...

256
00:23:06,912 --> 00:23:08,186
我的孩子!
My children!

257
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:11,087
我们已经变得十分日耳曼化了.
是的.
We're getting quite Teutonic already.
Yes.

258
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:15,379
那真正的意思是什么?
某些事情非常德国化
What does that really mean?
Something very German.

259
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:17,631
是的,战争
Yes, war.

260
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:31,504
有了你这样的人,
你就不必反犹太人了
With people like you,
you don't even have to be anti-Semitic.

261
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:34,886
我该为你祈祷吗?
已经迷失了.我从不祈祷.
Shall I pray with you?
Get lost. I don't pray, ever.

262
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,860
那么,你不是犹太人?
哦,那么我为什么在这儿?
So you're not Jewish?
Oh, so why am I here then?

263
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:40,190
没人知道.
No-one knows.

264
00:23:40,402 --> 00:23:43,713
我能问你件事吗?
那是唱的什么歌?
Can I ask you something?
What's there to sing about?

265
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:45,585
你有更好的主意了吗?
Have you got a better idea?

266
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:51,891
Nice catch.

267
00:23:57,418 --> 00:23:59,329
他吃好了吗?
是的.
Did he eat well?
Yes.

268
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:01,347
到入睡时间了.
Time to have a sleep.

269
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:04,316
再见,妈妈
Bye, Mummy.

270
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,302
他是我的.
当然,他是.
He's mine.
Of course he is.

271
00:24:06,552 --> 00:24:09,271
你可以一天来喂他两次,
但是现在你得离开.
You can come and feed him twice a day,
but now you have to go.

272
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:11,432
不,我想让他呆在身边
No! I want to keep him with me.

273
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:14,545
拦住她,拦住她.
Stop her. Stop her.

274
00:24:14,893 --> 00:24:17,248
斯古,听着.
Schoontje, listen.

275
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:19,239
不,他们要带走我的孩子.
No, they're taking my child away!

276
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:24,794
冷静点,很快你就能在一列火车上把布莱姆
抱在怀里了.我保证.
Calm down. Soon you'll be on the train
with Bram in your arms. I promise.

277
00:24:26,154 --> 00:24:28,794
好吗?我保证
OK? I promise.

278
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:31,956
我保证.
来吧.
I promise.
Come on.

279
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:35,379
苏斯坎德先生?
什么事?
Mr Silskind?
What?

280
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,196
你知道他们要去哪儿吗?
Do you know where they're going?

281
00:24:38,499 --> 00:24:40,775
西波克.
是的,之后呢?
Westerbork.
Yes, but after that?

282
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:42,598
在德国做工
To work in Germany.

283
00:24:44,505 --> 00:24:45,620
还有呢?
What? What else?

284
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:49,294
不知道.但是这很令人厌恶.
No idea. But it stinks.

285
00:25:03,731 --> 00:25:05,449
你得让我走.
夫人.
You have to let me go.
Madam.

286
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:08,691
我的孩子们正在街上流浪.
请离开.
My children are wandering the streets.
Please, leave.

287
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:11,224
停下.
Stop it.

288
00:25:11,489 --> 00:25:12,479
停下,停下!
Stop it, stop it!

289
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,175
就这样留下他们吗?
他们应该在CRAOCHE.
And just leave them?
They should be in the crÃ©che.

290
00:25:15,493 --> 00:25:19,202
去他的吧.你要送你的孩子去德国做工吗?
CrÃ©che, my arse! Are you sending
your kids to Germany to work?

291
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,890
你知道他们多大吗?
Do you have any idea how old they are?

292
00:25:35,595 --> 00:25:36,790
妈妈?
Mum?

293
00:25:45,313 --> 00:25:46,462
妈妈？
Mummy?

294
00:25:54,863 --> 00:25:56,774
为什么她不在这儿？
Why isn't she here?

295
00:26:11,212 --> 00:26:12,646
Please knock in future.

296
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:16,020
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

297
00:26:23,474 --> 00:26:25,112
你打算埋葬我吗？
Are you going to grass on me?

298
00:26:25,392 --> 00:26:26,382
白痴
Idiot.

299
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,529
复式簿记
Double-entry bookkeeping.

300
00:26:28,812 --> 00:26:31,452
违纪记录也标记在卡片上了。
The disciplinary cases
are marked on the cards too.

301
00:26:31,732 --> 00:26:34,406
我知道。这只是工作的一半
I know. This is only half of the work.

302
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,290
哦，你希望我也来扮演英雄吗？
Oh, you want me to play the hero too?

303
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:43,892
你拿到了钥匙。
去文件室的。
You've got the key.
To the file room.

304
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:49,526
Felix...

305
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:52,908
为什么你要接受这个烦人的差事？
Why did you take this lousy job?

306
00:26:53,961 --> 00:26:56,794
像你一样...
为了救自己.
Like you...
to save my skin.

307
00:26:57,173 --> 00:26:59,926
是的.那是你能够就得了的
Yes. And that's all you can save.

308
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:01,374
沃尔特.
Walter.

309
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:04,059
你认为我不恐惧吗?
Do you think I'm not afraid?

310
00:27:06,348 --> 00:27:08,737
你原本不该变成一个犹太人.
You shouldn't have become a Jew then.

311
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,494
你在干嘛?她在屋顶上!
谁?
What are you doing? She's on the roof!
Who?

312
00:27:12,646 --> 00:27:14,637
我想让他回来!
I want him back!

313
00:27:17,234 --> 00:27:20,306
我想让我的孩子现在就回来!
I want my child back now!

314
00:27:24,115 --> 00:27:25,230
布莱姆!
Bram!

315
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,294
让她从屋顶上下来.快点.
Get her down off the roof. Quickly.

316
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:34,338
穆勒!让她从那儿下来,
什么办法都行.
Muller! Get her down from there,
using any means.

317
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,460
布莱姆!布莱姆!
Bram! Bram!

318
00:27:55,895 --> 00:27:58,284
你似乎还没明白.
规则一?
You don't seem to have understood me.
Rule one?

319
00:27:58,648 --> 00:28:00,605
我想...
规则一?
I tried...
Rule one?

320
00:28:02,735 --> 00:28:04,885
日耳曼政权,
霍尔
Teutonic regime,
Herr Hauptsturmï¬‚lhrer.

321
00:28:05,238 --> 00:28:07,548
我绝不容许骚乱.
Under no circumstances
will I tolerate chaos.

322
00:28:07,823 --> 00:28:10,053
这是个意外.
我怎么阻止呢?
It was an accident.
How could I stop it?

323
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:12,358
你的教堂,你的责任
Your theatre, your responsibility.

324
00:30:22,577 --> 00:30:23,772
为什么？
Why?

325
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:27,593
他们做错了什么？
What have they done wrong?

326
00:30:27,873 --> 00:30:29,147
他们存在就是错
They exist.

327
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:32,947
真可怕。
I'm scared.

328
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:35,502
那就是他们想要的
That's exactly what they want.

329
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:44,537
这种仇恨来自何方?
Where did such hatred come from?

330
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,610
因为我们本身?
不.
Because of what we are?
No.

331
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:50,972
因为他们对我们的臆断.
Because of what they think we are.

332
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:54,832
因为我们所教授他们的东西
Because of what we teach them.

333
00:30:56,442 --> 00:30:58,592
纯洁和猥琐
About the pure and impure.

334
00:31:00,112 --> 00:31:03,230
有一条分界线
That there is a dividing line

335
00:31:03,574 --> 00:31:05,690
在接受和不能接受之间
between what is acceptable

336
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,783
and what is unacceptable.

337
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:49,766
我的床
My bed!

338
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:54,525
你是谁?
那是我的床!
Who are you?
That's my bed!

339
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,479
那是你的床吗?
Is that your bed?

340
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:02,268
你知道吗?
来,过来.
You know what?
Come and get it, come on.

341
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,997
不要.
过来.
Don't.
Come on.

342
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:06,775
西蒙!
Simon!

343
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:09,782
来这儿,你.
让我走!
Come here, you.
Let me go!

344
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:11,745
放他走!
Let him go!

345
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,243
不,不要
杂碎!
No, don't!
Bastard!

346
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,792
你在干什么,
你个犹太小贱人?
What are you doing,
you little Jewish bitch?

347
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,706
这是今晚的驱逐资料吗?
This is the deportation material
for tonight?

348
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,664
412人.
我们必须增加数字.
412 people.
We'll have to increase that.

349
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,588
翻一倍,乘以10!
你有足够的工人吗?
Double it, multiply it by ten!
Do you have enough workers?

350
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,700
当然,我有一个好团队.
Absolutely, I have a fine team.

351
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,277
谢谢你.
Thank you.

352
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,610
豪普,我可以问你件事吗?
Hauptsturmï¬‚lhrer,
may I ask you something?

353
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,951
说.
Go ahead.

354
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,636
他们去哪儿?
Where do they go?

355
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,718
我是说,到西波克之后?
I mean, after Westerbork?

356
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,841
我的责任火车一开就结束了.
这是我仅能告诉你的.
My responsibility ends when the train
leaves. That's all I can tell you.

357
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:58,485
犹太人欠我们劳力,
我们自己的人正在打仗.
The Jews owe us their labour,
while our own men are fighting the war.

358
00:32:58,934 --> 00:33:02,643
那么德国将使得犹太人感激最终的胜利?
So Germany will have the Jews
to thank for its eventual victory?

359
00:33:03,063 --> 00:33:06,852
豪普,
我发现一个纰漏,一个D
Hauptsturmï¬‚lhrer,
I have found a discrepancy, a 'D'.

360
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:11,072
一条驱逐记录,卡片上有,名单上没有.
A disciplinary case, which is
on the card but not on the list.

361
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,293
逮捕他们.他们全体.
Arrest them. All of them!

362
00:33:21,581 --> 00:33:22,537
是的.长官!
Yes, sir!

363
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,828
处死犹太人!处死犹太人!
Death to Jews! Death to Jews!

364
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:32,266
你们一起关到毛特豪森.
Off to Mauthausen with the lot of you.

365
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:37,001
知道你们突然记起名字.
Unless you suddenly remember the name.

366
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:44,042
谁篡改了名单?
Who messed with the list?

367
00:33:44,352 --> 00:33:49,347
霍尔,我保证我绝不容许破坏和篡改.
Herr Hauptsturmfiihrer, I assure you I do
not tolerate sabotage or falsification.

368
00:33:49,774 --> 00:33:52,163
但是这或许是个笔误.
我们毕竟是人不是神.
But it might be a mistake,
we're only human.

369
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:53,722
胡说八道.
That's bullshit.

370
00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:58,935
给我个说得通的理由不惩罚你们的笔误。
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't punish your 'mistake'.

371
00:33:59,325 --> 00:34:00,724
苏斯坎德先生...
Mr Silskind...

372
00:34:04,913 --> 00:34:06,904
我会得到什么?
What would I achieve?

373
00:34:09,626 --> 00:34:11,139
命令
Order.

374
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,433
没有我,你选择了骚乱.
Without me, you choose chaos.

375
00:34:13,714 --> 00:34:16,024
因为我从机器上挪了个小齿吗?
Because I remove one small cog
from the machine?

376
00:34:16,508 --> 00:34:19,978
你的机器将继续运转.
我很容替换
Your machine will go on working.
I'm easy to replace.

377
00:34:20,345 --> 00:34:21,904
但是有一个区别
But there is one difference.

378
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,775
你可以相信我,
我是德国人.
You can trust me.
I'm German.

379
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:29,180
什么意思?
我是一个商人
Meaning?
I'm a businessman.

380
00:34:30,813 --> 00:34:32,292
一个识时务的人
A realist.

381
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:35,486
所以我采取了识时务的做法
So I take a realistic approach.

382
00:34:36,861 --> 00:34:40,297
我接受的德国修养,上的德国学校.
I've had a German upbringing,
went to a German school.

383
00:34:40,656 --> 00:34:44,012
我把你当做上级
I acknowledge you as my superior.

384
00:34:45,118 --> 00:34:48,827
霍尔,让我做我的工作.
Herr Hauptsturmï¬‚lhrer,
let me do my job.

385
00:34:56,671 --> 00:34:59,663
苏斯坎德先生?
我们很清楚.
Mr Silskind?
Just so we're clear.

386
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:02,438
再笔误一次,你就上火车.
One more 'mistake'
and you'll be on the train.

387
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,159
连同你的家人.
With your family.

388
00:35:09,642 --> 00:35:11,952
上帝,我以为我要死了.
My God, I thought I was going to die.

389
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:13,457
我得到了公正的对待.
I was treated correctly.

390
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:15,617
他可能喜欢我.
一个党卫军人?
He probably likes me.
An SS man?

391
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:18,208
或许,他对我信以为真.
Maybe he's fallen for me.

392
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:21,241
但是,怎么回事?
哦,没什么.那个傲慢的白痴!
But what happened?
Oh, nothing. That arrogant idiot!

393
00:35:21,612 --> 00:35:25,845
海佛先生,傻瓜.大英雄用他的墨水来反对一伙
恶棍
Mr Haiverstad. The dimwit. The big hero
with his ink against a gang of crooks.

394
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:29,393
冷静点.一切会完美了结.
好.
Calm down. It all ended well.
Yeah.

395
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:36,983
那边有人病了.去看看.
There's someone ill back there
over on the side. Go and see.

396
00:35:41,255 --> 00:35:46,614
392, 393, 394.

397
00:35:47,052 --> 00:35:52,126
395, 396, 397.

398
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:34,765
请勿动手.
Keep your hands off me.

399
00:36:35,056 --> 00:36:36,410
跟我们来!
人渣!
Come with us!
Scumbag!

400
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:56,221
看!
Look!

401
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,986
妈妈,妈妈!
Mummy! Mummy!

402
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,343
鲁斯!西蒙!
Roos! Simon!

403
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:07,307
我说安静点.
I said be quiet.

404
00:37:07,754 --> 00:37:09,552
西蒙!放我走!
Simon! Let me go!

405
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:15,244
你聋了吗?安静点!
放我走.西蒙!
Are you deaf? Be quiet!
Let go of me. Simon!

406
00:37:31,944 --> 00:37:33,855
闻起来不错.
That smells good.

407
00:37:34,154 --> 00:37:35,588
我是沃尔特叔叔.
I'm Uncle Walter.

408
00:37:35,864 --> 00:37:37,298
你呢?
And you?

409
00:37:38,534 --> 00:37:42,323
我是鲁斯,那是西蒙.
嗨,西蒙.
I'm Roos and that's Simon.
Hi Simon.

410
00:37:42,954 --> 00:37:46,629
没有证件,什么也没有.
他们呆在这儿行吗?
No papers, nothing.
Is it alright if they stay here?

411
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:50,303
怎么回事?
那是来自普世的恶霸.
What happened?
It was that bully from Puls.

412
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,356
关键人物.
你得在这儿睡.
The key man.
You'll just have to sleep here.

413
00:37:54,757 --> 00:37:57,112
关键人物这儿不允许.
Key men aren't allowed in here.

414
00:37:57,427 --> 00:37:58,781
晚安
Goodnight.

415
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:01,613
沃尔特叔叔?
Uncle Walter?

416
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:04,669
他们带妈妈去哪儿?
Where are they taking Mummy?

417
00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:31,444
我想要谢谢你.
I wanted to thank you.

418
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,699
谢什么?
What for?

419
00:38:33,002 --> 00:38:35,278
没埋葬我.
For not grassing on me.

420
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,186
我想要道歉。
And I want to apologise.

421
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:40,980
我是个白痴。
是的.
I'm an idiot.
Yes.

422
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:42,736
干你的活吧.
Just do your job.

423
00:38:44,263 --> 00:38:46,254
是的长官.
另一只手.
Yes, sir!
Other hand.

424
00:39:48,574 --> 00:39:49,973
让他们腐烂
Let them perish.

425
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,515
我们在救生艇上是安全的.
亲爱的.
We're safe in the lifeboat.
Darling.

426
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:56,218
如果我能救得了他们之中的一个.
If I could just have saved one of them.

427
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,344
我们需要藏起来吗?
知道一切结束.
Are we going into hiding then?
Until it's allover.

428
00:40:01,628 --> 00:40:05,508
没有人剩下.我能听到上帝责怪我.
And there's no-one left.
I can hear God berating me.

429
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:08,351
你的话是什么意思?
不能接受.
What do you mean?
That it's unacceptable

430
00:40:08,635 --> 00:40:11,468
在纯洁和猥琐之间存在着差别
that a distinction is made
between pure and impure.

431
00:40:12,472 --> 00:40:14,145
不要试图成为英雄,沃尔特.
Don't try to be a hero, Walter.

432
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:31,889
我以后将怎么跟她解释我除掉了100,000人?
How am I going to explain to her later
that I got rid of 100,000 people?

433
00:40:32,282 --> 00:40:34,319
上帝知道他们在哪儿结束.
And God knows
where they end up.

434
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,116
我们呢?
What about us?

435
00:40:38,246 --> 00:40:41,159
没有人能帮我们吗?
Is there nobody who can help us?

436
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,649
上帝?
God?

437
00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:49,436
我们不得不自助自救
没有上帝.
We'll have to manage on our own.
Without God.

438
00:40:49,757 --> 00:40:51,395
但是我有你.
But I've got you.

439
00:40:52,343 --> 00:40:53,697
是吗?
Haven't I?

440
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:57,868
做你该做的
Do what you have to do.

441
00:41:15,365 --> 00:41:17,322
皮耶特.
沃尔特.
Piet.
Walter.

442
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:19,574
你能来太好了.
对.
Glad you came.
Right.

443
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:22,210
考尔,我有另外一个.
Cor, I'll have another one.

444
00:41:28,336 --> 00:41:29,815
我在听着.
I'm listening.

445
00:41:31,297 --> 00:41:35,495
没有豪言,没有暴力,没有武器.
从没有.也没有那些孩子
No heroics, no violence, no weapons.
Never. Not with those kids.

446
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:38,403
那些索引卡的问题遗留着.
The problem of
those index cards remains.

447
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:40,519
是的,我们知道所有的这些事情
Yes, we know all about that.

448
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:45,004
但是锁链牢固取决于最弱的一环.
But a chain is only as strong as
its weakest link.

449
00:41:45,394 --> 00:41:48,307
费尔长官.
无耻,笨蛋.
Aus der Filnten.
Unscrupulous, a lout.

450
00:41:49,231 --> 00:41:52,906
或许是个杂碎.但是极端的孤独.
A bastard maybe. But as lonely as hell.

451
00:41:54,152 --> 00:41:56,382
你问什么认为他好喝酒?
Why do you think he drinks?

452
00:41:56,696 --> 00:41:58,050
他们全都很孤独吗？
They're all lonely?

453
00:41:58,323 --> 00:42:00,075
为什么你认为我仍然在这儿？
Why do you think I'm still here?

454
00:42:00,366 --> 00:42:02,642
我跟他说话的时候像一个酸菜佬跟另一个说一样。
I talk to him as one Kraut to another.

455
00:42:02,952 --> 00:42:05,023
他每次都让我有机会
He gives me every opportunity

456
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:08,401
说服他相信如果他不让我留下
他就是个混蛋
to convince him he's an arsehole
if he doesn't let me stay.

457
00:42:08,749 --> 00:42:09,944
听着
Listen...

458
00:42:13,045 --> 00:42:15,719
我可以把这个换成白兰地和雪茄吗
Can I exchange this
for brandy and cigars?

459
00:42:16,298 --> 00:42:18,687
好东西，
不是低劣货。
Good stuff,
not that rotgut.

460
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:20,682
问问老科尔
Ask Old Cor.

461
00:42:27,976 --> 00:42:31,048
军士是个好警官。
他们的确是。
The sergeant is a good cop.
They do exist.

462
00:42:31,396 --> 00:42:35,913
你要白兰地干什么？
安慰，安抚，庆祝。
What'll you do with the brandy?
Soothe, conciliate, placate, win over.

463
00:42:36,317 --> 00:42:38,467
费尔长官.
这是带我们去哪儿?
Aus der Filnten.
And where does that get us?

464
00:42:38,778 --> 00:42:42,089
如果他觉得我是朋友的话,
就会转移他的注意力.
It diverts his attention.
If he thinks I'm his friend...

465
00:42:42,448 --> 00:42:45,008
那样的一个杂碎吗?
没有机会的.
A bastard like that?
No chance.

466
00:42:45,326 --> 00:42:48,478
我们还想不想把那些孩子捞出来?
Do we want to get those kids
out of there or not?

467
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:05,326
会一切顺利的
It'll be fine.

468
00:43:18,816 --> 00:43:20,966
1,2,3,4
One, two, three, four.

469
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:25,361
不!
Don't!

470
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:28,769
你觉得你在干嘛?
吵醒孩子们!
What do you think you're doing?
Waking little kids up!

471
00:44:02,483 --> 00:44:10,038
380, 381, 382, 384.

472
00:44:10,574 --> 00:44:16,923
385, 388, 387, 389.

473
00:44:23,836 --> 00:44:26,828
向你祝贺,苏斯坎德.干得好.
谢谢你.
My compliments, Silskind. Well done.
Thank you.

474
00:44:41,436 --> 00:44:42,915
用一个戴维的吻.
With a kiss from David.

475
00:44:43,188 --> 00:44:45,862
我宁愿让他在身边.
快过他的生日了.
I'd rather keep him with me.
It's nearly his birthday.

476
00:44:46,191 --> 00:44:47,989
他会被好好照顾的,
我承诺.
He'll be in good hands,
I promise you.

477
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,284
你明天没生过孩子.
You obviously don't have children.

478
00:44:54,657 --> 00:44:55,727
格劳夫人...
Mrs Groenteman...

479
00:44:55,992 --> 00:44:59,986
战后你们会团聚的.
他可以跟农夫们留在弗瑞兰.
You'll be reunited after the war.
He can stay with farmers in Friesland.

480
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:12,865
你的儿子如此.
我们年轻而健壮.
It's about your son.
We're young and strong.

481
00:45:13,175 --> 00:45:15,564
非常有能力照顾好自己的孩子.
And quite capable of looking
after our own child.

482
00:45:15,886 --> 00:45:17,923
甚至在集中营?
不行就是不行.
Even in a labour camp?
No is no.

483
00:45:18,221 --> 00:45:20,292
继续干活,女士.
Just get on with your work, miss.

484
00:45:21,474 --> 00:45:23,067
继续干活...
Just get on with your work...

485
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:25,888
你尽了全力.
You did your best.

486
00:45:27,063 --> 00:45:28,781
但是那个孩子呢?
But what about that child?

487
00:45:30,108 --> 00:45:32,304
安抚一下.
安抚？
Conciliate.
Conciliate?

488
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,920
费尔长官，他穿过了街道。
Aus der Filnten, he's across the street.

489
00:45:35,196 --> 00:45:36,789
在CRAOCHE?
是的。
At the crÃ©che?
Yes.

490
00:45:37,323 --> 00:45:38,961
他带着个婴儿。
He brought a baby.

491
00:45:42,077 --> 00:45:45,308
我告诉你，这个地方仅为了犹太儿童。
I'm telling you, this place is only
for Jewish children.

492
00:45:45,664 --> 00:45:48,782
从现在开始每个被遗弃的孩子都
当犹太人对待
From now on every abandoned child
is considered Jewish.

493
00:45:49,084 --> 00:45:51,997
我愿意打赌保证她是犹太人。
I'm willing to bet you
she is Jewish.

494
00:45:52,379 --> 00:45:53,778
苏斯坎德先生。
Mr Silskind.

495
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,243
昨天一切顺利。
向你祝贺。
That went well yesterday.
My compliments.

496
00:45:56,633 --> 00:45:58,829
不可思议。
多么无情的母亲呀！
Incredible.
What an unnatural mother!

497
00:45:59,094 --> 00:46:01,654
遗弃这么一个漂亮的婴儿。
Abandoning such a beautiful baby.

498
00:46:01,971 --> 00:46:04,008
典型的犹太人行为。
Typical Jewish behaviour.

499
00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:06,989
她看起来一点不像犹太人。
犹太人什么样？
She doesn't look Jewish at all.
What is Jewish?

500
00:46:07,435 --> 00:46:08,391
鲍尔。
Bauer.

501
00:46:09,395 --> 00:46:12,274
全都在这儿了。理论上说来。
It's all in here. Scientifically.

502
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:14,723
谁有皮尺吗？
Does anyone have a tape measure?

503
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:25,961
你忘了她的鼻子。
You forgot her nose.

504
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:29,912
百分百。
我知道。
One hundred percent.
I knew it.

505
00:46:30,248 --> 00:46:31,318
她可以留下
She can stay.

506
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:35,625
或许一个喜剧结局的小块面包。
Perhaps a little toast
to a happy ending?

507
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,644
你为什么那样看着我？
Why are you looking at me like that?

508
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:47,008
很长时间没有跟同乡喝一杯了。
It's been a long time since I had
a drink with a fellow countryman.

509
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:50,030
那么，德国人在阿姆斯特丹干了什么？
So, what's a German
doing in Amsterdam?

510
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:53,556
我的祖父母来自荷兰。
我知道。
My grandparents were from Holland.
I see.

511
00:46:53,896 --> 00:46:55,614
你想家吗？
Aren't you homesick?

512
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:04,642
谢谢
Thank you.

513
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:22,842
信不信由你，我23岁才吸烟喝酒。
NITA掉了！
Believe it or not, but until I was 23
I never smoked, never drank. Nita drop!

514
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:26,052
我们全都单纯善良。
We were all for nature,
for purity.

515
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,495
在松枝床上，睡在星空下
Sleeping under the stars
on a bed of pine needles.

516
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,918
有理想，有理性。
Dreaming and philosophizing.

517
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,580
我们想要改变世界。
We wanted to change the world.

518
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:38,173
我们也这么做了。
And we have done too.

519
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,329
我曾经有个同志。
I once had a comrade.

520
00:47:46,654 --> 00:47:51,683
你不会再找到比他更好的了
You'd never find a better one.

521
00:47:52,118 --> 00:47:56,476
战鼓敲响
The drum beat for battle.

522
00:47:56,872 --> 00:48:01,025
他走过我身边。
He marched by my side.

523
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:05,340
我们保持步伐。
We kept in step.

524
00:48:05,714 --> 00:48:09,548
保持步伐一致
We kept in step.

525
00:48:09,927 --> 00:48:13,636
一个子弹向我们射来。
A bullet flew towards us.

526
00:48:14,014 --> 00:48:17,405
射向我还是射向他呢？
Is it for me or for him?

527
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:21,044
这带走了他的生命。
It took away his life.

528
00:48:21,354 --> 00:48:24,472
现在，他就躺在我的脚下。
Now he's lying at my feet.

529
00:48:24,816 --> 00:48:27,854
就像他倒向我。
As if he's pan' of me.

530
00:48:28,194 --> 00:48:31,505
就像他倒向我。
As if he's pan' of me.

531
00:48:50,924 --> 00:48:54,474
那些俄国人都是老虎。
德国佬没有把握时机。
Those Russians are tigers.
The Krauts don't stand a chance.

532
00:48:54,844 --> 00:48:57,074
我想要去斯纳.
沃尔特？
I want to go to Sienna.
Walter?

533
00:48:57,347 --> 00:48:59,304
去佛罗伦斯，去...！
And to Florence, the Ponce Vecchio!

534
00:48:59,641 --> 00:49:01,279
战争还没结束.
The war's not over yet.

535
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:03,512
差不多了.不会太久.
It nearly is. Not long now.

536
00:49:03,811 --> 00:49:07,850
我知道斯纳很好的酒店.
ll Fiore di Dante.
I know this really sweet hotel
in Sienna, ll Fiore di Dante.

537
00:49:08,232 --> 00:49:09,870
他们有家乡风味的无花果酱.
They have homemade fig jam.

538
00:49:10,151 --> 00:49:12,301
美味,但是亲爱的...
Delicious. But darling...

539
00:49:12,611 --> 00:49:13,567
我不能离开.
I can't leave.

540
00:49:15,572 --> 00:49:16,767
还不能.
Not yet.

541
00:49:19,076 --> 00:49:22,751
是的,他们是为了你.
坚持住.像这样.
Yes, they're for you.
Hold on. Like this.

542
00:49:25,874 --> 00:49:27,308
从这儿过.
Here you go.

543
00:49:29,961 --> 00:49:31,235
通过
PASS

544
00:49:48,479 --> 00:49:52,188
13张邮票.
我们做到了!我们做到了!
Thirteen stamps.
We did it! We did it!

545
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:55,998
你得呆在这儿.
不要被驱逐.
You have to stay here,
but won't be deported.

546
00:49:59,448 --> 00:50:02,440
谢谢.
我会告诉豪普
Thank you.
I'll tell the Haupsturmï¬‚lhrer.

547
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:13,124
那是不可接受的.
做点什么吧.
That is unacceptable.
Do something about it.

548
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,423
鲁斯和西蒙沃特曼
谢谢上帝.
Roos and Simon Waterman,
thank God.

549
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:20,187
他们要去哪儿?
辛德勒彭.
Where will they go?
Hindeloopen.

550
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:27,464
嗨.
1,2,3,4,5
Hello.
One, two, three, four, five.

551
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:44,388
Coats.

552
00:50:53,624 --> 00:50:55,023
快点
Hurry UP!

553
00:51:26,906 --> 00:51:28,704
我们呆在这儿吗?
Are we staying here?

554
00:51:29,033 --> 00:51:32,230
不,你稍后乘车.
和那个警察吗?
No, you'll take the train later.
With that cop?

555
00:51:35,581 --> 00:51:37,174
稍等
Wait a minute

556
00:51:39,251 --> 00:51:40,605
有问题吗?
ls there a problem?

557
00:51:40,877 --> 00:51:43,949
那个小男孩不能来.很抱歉.
为什么?他回不来.
That little boy can't come. I'm sorry.
Why? He can't go back.

558
00:51:44,297 --> 00:51:46,857
他得来.
但是他的卡片被破坏了.
He'll have to.
But his card's been destroyed.

559
00:51:47,175 --> 00:51:49,610
没有人敢带着他
看他的脸
Nobody will dare take him.
Look at his face.

560
00:51:49,928 --> 00:51:51,566
他的脸?
His face?

561
00:51:51,846 --> 00:51:54,759
怎么回事?
这些人在拿生命冒险.
What's wrong with it?
These people are risking their lives.

562
00:51:55,099 --> 00:51:57,136
我不会留下他独自一人
I'm not leaving him on his own!

563
00:52:01,606 --> 00:52:04,246
现在是黑暗时期,年轻的女士.
These are dark days, young lady.

564
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:06,205
又是犹太人? 疯了!
Too Jewish? Meshuga!

565
00:52:06,485 --> 00:52:09,955
也许是这样,如果他们检查的话
我们全都有巨大危险.
That may be so, but if they do
a check we're all in big trouble.

566
00:52:13,784 --> 00:52:16,344
你想让他整天坐在那儿吗
You want him to sit in there all day?

567
00:52:19,331 --> 00:52:21,720
我不认为那是个好主意.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

568
00:52:23,376 --> 00:52:26,846
上来这儿很棒.
那是他们看见的第一个地方.
Up here is perfect.
That's the first place they'll look.

569
00:52:27,213 --> 00:52:31,286
荒谬.
但是真的.还会有别的.
It's absurd.
But it's true. And there will be more.

570
00:52:33,136 --> 00:52:35,491
简直疯了!荒唐!
That's just crazy! Ridiculous!

571
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,773
小心你的手指!
Watch your fingers!

572
00:52:41,102 --> 00:52:42,376
不，沃尔特。
No, Walter.

573
00:52:44,104 --> 00:52:47,540
但是我们把他们放在哪儿？
他们无处可去，该死。
But where shall we put them?
There's nowhere they can go, dammit.

574
00:52:48,525 --> 00:52:49,720
那边是什么？
What's over there?

575
00:52:49,985 --> 00:52:52,101
一个学院
A college.

576
00:52:54,614 --> 00:52:56,287
Mr. Van Hulst?

577
00:52:57,867 --> 00:52:59,983
Miss Pimentel.

578
00:53:00,286 --> 00:53:03,483
你们从礼堂(剧院)来，是不是？
苏斯坎德先生？
You're from the theatre, aren't you?
Mr Silskind?

579
00:53:03,831 --> 00:53:06,584
是的，我想要问你件事。
Yes. I wanted to ask you something.

580
00:53:07,335 --> 00:53:10,885
我知道你会有一天来看我，
并且不是通过前门。
I knew you'd come and see me one day.
And not via the front door.

581
00:53:12,882 --> 00:53:13,917
你的屋棚。
Your shed.

582
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,871
我们能用一下吗？
Could we use it?

583
00:53:18,887 --> 00:53:21,003
是急救，我拿走了？
It's an emergency, I take it?

584
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,859
半空的火车
A half-empty train.

585
00:53:56,173 --> 00:53:57,971
你知道那要花多少钱吗？
Do you know how much that costs?

586
00:53:58,258 --> 00:54:00,056
远远超出我的财力。
It is beyond my control.

587
00:54:00,344 --> 00:54:03,735
你们有多少人？
大约400
How many people have you got here?
Almost 400.

588
00:54:04,097 --> 00:54:05,895
几乎400
Almost 400?

589
00:54:07,058 --> 00:54:12,212
很抱歉。
但是战争还要持续一阵子
'lam sorry, mein Fuhrer,
but the war will have to wait a while.

590
00:54:12,647 --> 00:54:14,843
我尊敬的同事犯了个失误
My esteemed colleague
made a mistake.'

591
00:54:15,149 --> 00:54:17,459
我不会魔术。
你也不会计数。
I can't do magic.
You can't count either.

592
00:54:17,777 --> 00:54:21,088
400人就是400人
400 Jews are 400 Jews

593
00:54:21,447 --> 00:54:23,723
不是什么几乎400
and not almost 400.

594
00:54:41,883 --> 00:54:46,275
你们现在又多少孤儿？
没有父母，流落街道。
How many orphans do you have right now?
Without parents across the street.

595
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:48,192
几乎没有。
多少？
Hardly any.
How many?

596
00:54:55,104 --> 00:54:57,744
连上她，13
那就够了
With her, thirteen.
That will just be enough.

597
00:54:58,065 --> 00:55:00,102
拜托，他们只是孩子。
Please, they're just children.

598
00:55:00,401 --> 00:55:03,598
犹太儿童，明天的敌人。
把他们包裹暖和。
Jewish children. Tomorrow's enemy
Wrap them up warm.

599
00:55:03,946 --> 00:55:05,175
所有的13个
All thirteen?

600
00:55:06,907 --> 00:55:08,261
继续走
And get a move on.

601
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:20,827
这远超我的财力。
相信我，我也不想这样
It's beyond my control.
Believe me, I don't want this either.

602
00:55:21,212 --> 00:55:23,010
那么，不要这么做。
如果你不想。
Then don't do it
if you don't want to

603
00:55:23,339 --> 00:55:25,808
我不得不，这是命令
做你能做的
I have to, it's an order.
Do what you can.

604
00:55:26,134 --> 00:55:29,525
如果柏林命令式400，我只能发送
387
If Berlin orders 400
and I only send 387

605
00:55:29,887 --> 00:55:32,117
你认为将会发生什么？
what do you think will happen?

606
00:55:32,431 --> 00:55:35,310
对我？送到中央局？
To me? To the Central Bureau?

607
00:55:35,643 --> 00:55:36,678
对她呢？
And to her?

608
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,841
德国战争工业要什么？
What does the German war industry want?

609
00:55:40,147 --> 00:55:43,185
一个文明的国家不在工厂使用童工
A civilised country
doesn't make children work in factories.

610
00:55:43,525 --> 00:55:45,482
家人相聚在一起
Families have to stay together.

611
00:55:46,445 --> 00:55:49,005
数字不得不加总起来。
的确。
And the numbers have to add up.
Exactly.

612
00:55:50,115 --> 00:55:51,674
Vigeveno, Lea.

613
00:55:52,826 --> 00:55:54,385
Vigeveno, Isaac.
That's me.

614
00:55:56,037 --> 00:55:57,948
De Vries, Salomon.
Yes, sir.

615
00:55:58,915 --> 00:56:00,633
Flessedrager, Zwaantje.

616
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:07,579
我有个建议，苏斯坎德先生
I have a proposition, Mr Silskind.

617
00:56:09,091 --> 00:56:11,844
你的选择，取决于你。
Your choice. It's up to you.

618
00:56:12,178 --> 00:56:14,169
孩子们也不...
Either the children...

619
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:17,293
Of...

620
00:56:27,108 --> 00:56:31,181
我的妈妈曾给科恩夫人做过清洁工
My mother worked as
a cleaning woman for Mrs Kohn.

621
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:35,201
她的丈夫是一个,你们怎么称呼呢,犹太教堂唱诗者
Her husband was a, what do you call it,
the singer in the synagogue?

622
00:56:35,575 --> 00:56:37,134
Hazzan.
Hazzan.

623
00:56:43,165 --> 00:56:47,523
我得有七八岁了,当我听到科恩先生唱的时候
I must have been seven, eight years old
when I heard the Jew Kohn sing.

624
00:56:48,546 --> 00:56:49,945
棒极了.
Wonderful!

625
00:56:51,256 --> 00:56:53,054
我也想像那样唱
I wanted to sing like that too.

626
00:56:54,718 --> 00:56:56,868
你有时候也那么觉得吗?
Do you feel that too sometimes...

627
00:56:57,554 --> 00:56:59,511
忧伤使你高兴?
a sadness
that makes you happy?

628
00:57:01,933 --> 00:57:03,571
你知道那种感觉吗?
Do you know that feeling?

629
00:57:05,645 --> 00:57:06,601
是的
Yes.

630
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:12,663
他今天怎么样?
How is he today?

631
00:57:15,613 --> 00:57:17,365
谁?
科恩先生?
Who?
Mr Kohn?

632
00:57:28,167 --> 00:57:30,920
我们不是野蛮人
We're not barbarians.

633
00:57:31,295 --> 00:57:33,684
多么美妙的管弦乐队啊
Such a beautiful orchestra.

634
00:57:35,132 --> 00:57:37,646
或许我们应该送走孩子。
Maybe we should
send the children after all?

635
00:58:25,388 --> 00:58:28,346
我会在周五小小庆祝一下
I'm having a little celebration
on Friday.

636
00:58:28,974 --> 00:58:31,727
你出席我会很荣幸
I would value your presence.

637
00:58:33,979 --> 00:58:35,049
我？
Me?

638
00:58:35,272 --> 00:58:37,741
非常随意
就是我和几个朋友
It's very informal.
Just me and a few friends.

639
00:58:40,152 --> 00:58:41,108
谢谢
Thank you.

640
00:58:41,361 --> 00:58:43,238
为了邀请我
For inviting me.

641
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:45,168
但是，你看
But, you see...

642
00:58:46,283 --> 00:58:47,842
我的妻子有一点焦虑
My wife is a little anxious.

643
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:49,877
能发生什么？
What can happen?

644
00:58:50,161 --> 00:58:53,597
我也亲自保证你和你家人的安全
I personally guarantee your safety
and your family's too,

645
00:58:53,957 --> 00:58:55,868
你也可以有个书面保证
you can have that in black and white.

646
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:58,317
好的，周五见
Well, see you this Friday then.

647
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:04,664
老科尔对你的朋友致以问候。
Old Cor sends his regards.
For your friend.

648
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:06,522
他让我恶心，杂碎
He makes me sick.
Bastard.

649
00:59:06,802 --> 00:59:07,758
可也是自己人的杂碎
But our bastard.

650
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:10,162
自己人的？谁会去他的宴会？
Ours? Who's going
to his birthday party?

651
00:59:10,472 --> 00:59:12,941
你是个英雄
我不要英雄，我想要个丈夫
You're a hero.
I don't want a hero, but a husband.

652
00:59:13,267 --> 00:59:16,578
我们计划救走多少孩子？
5008个
How many have we managed to get away?
50, 80 children?

653
00:59:16,937 --> 00:59:20,248
388人住。
338.
338 human lives.

654
00:59:22,234 --> 00:59:25,113
卡车上我已经装了多少？
40000还是50000？
And how many have I put on the trucks?
40,000 or 50,000?

655
00:59:25,445 --> 00:59:26,674
你不能那样想
You can't think like that.

656
00:59:26,946 --> 00:59:28,983
我看见了全部的在黑暗中恐惧的脸
I see all those scared faces
in the dark.

657
00:59:29,282 --> 00:59:31,353
好的。
OK, fine.

658
00:59:31,659 --> 00:59:34,219
那么停止吧。但是不会再有孩子能逃脱了
So stop. But then no more children
will get away.

659
00:59:35,121 --> 00:59:36,680
这取决于你。
It's up to you.

660
00:59:40,459 --> 00:59:42,257
我想让你现在离开。
汉娜。
I'd like you to leave now.
Hanna.

661
00:59:42,878 --> 00:59:44,232
或者我走。
Or I'll go.

662
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:46,564
去哪儿？
Where to?

663
00:59:47,716 --> 00:59:49,275
Just bugger off!

664
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:52,464
There's an art to exaggerating.
Why would they?

665
00:59:54,056 --> 00:59:58,527
犹太人的强制性劳力的结果是种族灭绝
"The forced labour of the Jews turns out
to be systematic extermination."

666
00:59:58,935 --> 01:00:01,290
英式的宣传。
我希望你是对的
English propaganda.
I hope you're right.

667
01:00:10,404 --> 01:00:12,873
5星。谢谢
Five stars. Thank you.

668
01:00:13,616 --> 01:00:16,005
多谢。亲爱的沃尔特
Many thanks, dear... Walter.

669
01:00:17,286 --> 01:00:19,641
我可以称呼你沃尔特吗？
当然。
May I call you Walter?
Of course.

670
01:00:20,622 --> 01:00:25,173
你和我在同一条船上。
你不知道，是不是？
You and I are in the same boat.
You didn't know that, did you?

671
01:00:29,965 --> 01:00:35,199
当这个结束，当这个地方清除了犹太人，
我们都可以去东部
When this is over, when the place is
cleansed of Jews, we can both go east.

672
01:00:35,637 --> 01:00:38,356
你去波兰工作
我去俄国前线
You to work in Poland,
me to the Front in Russia.

673
01:00:38,681 --> 01:00:41,992
我可以问你些那种情况吗？
你知道那意味着什么吗？
May I ask you something about that?
Do you know what that means?

674
01:00:42,352 --> 01:00:44,070
去东部前线？
不。
The Eastern Front?
No.

675
01:00:44,562 --> 01:00:47,634
你除了...什么都不是.
You're nothing but cannon fodder.

676
01:00:47,982 --> 01:00:50,451
直到你被吹成碎片.
Until you're blown to pieces.

677
01:00:55,322 --> 01:00:57,120
对不起,沃尔特.
Sorry, Walter.

678
01:00:57,449 --> 01:01:00,043
这个时候一切太过分了点.
It's all a bit much at the moment.

679
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:03,009
在我生日时,
And on my birthday, of all days...

680
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:06,898
I got a river front my sister.

681
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:09,924
你有兄弟吗?
是的.
Do you have any brothers?
Yes.

682
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:12,487
我再也没有了
I don't any more.

683
01:01:12,797 --> 01:01:14,276
周日
Sunday...

684
01:01:16,592 --> 01:01:18,742
海姆特自杀了.
Helmut hanged himself.

685
01:01:22,348 --> 01:01:23,304
上帝
God!

686
01:01:24,892 --> 01:01:27,850
这儿.
不.谢谢.我好了.
Here.
No. Thank you. I'm alright.

687
01:01:29,813 --> 01:01:31,087
这该死的战争.
This damned war!

688
01:01:32,816 --> 01:01:36,332
如果不是为了战争,
我们也许会是很好的朋友.
If it weren't for the war,
we might very well be friends.

689
01:01:37,863 --> 01:01:41,094
是的.
真正的好朋友.
Yes.
Really good friends.

690
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:58,451
欢迎.
Welcome.

691
01:01:58,716 --> 01:02:00,753
晚上好,西奇夫人.
Good evening, Mrs Hirschfeld.

692
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:05,647
来打猎野鸡有趣吧?
野鸡到处都是
Fancy coming pheasant hunting?
They're everywhere.

693
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:07,850
阿尔伯特!
佛迪。身日快乐。
Albert!
Ferdi. Happy birthday.

694
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:09,132
谢谢。
Thanks.

695
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:13,515
我听说了你兄弟的事情。
你的妹妹一定很抓狂。
I heard about your brother.
Your sister must be very upset.

696
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,554
是的
Yes.

697
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:19,305
战争就是战争。
美酒就是美酒。
War is war.
And a drink is a drink.

698
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:22,964
别担心，我们不会送你去沃戈。
Don't worry. They won't
be sending you to the Volga!

699
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:24,438
干杯。
干杯。
Cheers.
Cheers.

700
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,665
只要全欧洲的事情进行的向这里
的同样顺利。
If only it was going as smoothly
all over Europe as here.

701
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:31,032
来观看很荣幸。
谢谢我们的礼堂(剧院)主管。
It's a pleasure to watch.
Thanks to our theatre manager.

702
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,640
苏斯坎德先生，
Mr Silskind, Obersturmï¬‚lhrer Gemmeker.

703
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,188
西波克过度营的长官。
Commandant of
Westerbork Transition Camp.

704
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:39,620
见到你很高兴。
见到你很高兴。请原谅。
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you. Excuse me.

705
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:47,721
为你的妻子。
For your wife.

706
01:02:48,013 --> 01:02:50,004
谢谢。

Thank you.
希尔维？
Sylvie?

707
01:02:52,142 --> 01:02:53,576
只是给你的！
And this is for you!

708
01:02:56,729 --> 01:02:58,640
开心点。沃尔特。
Have fun, Walter.

709
01:03:06,656 --> 01:03:07,612
L...

710
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:12,829
希尔维，你应该知道...
你很羞涩,是不是?
Sylvie, you should know...
You are shy, aren't you?

711
01:03:17,124 --> 01:03:18,762
一个大人物
A high-up...

712
01:03:20,252 --> 01:03:22,971
但不是党卫军,对吗?
but not SS, right?

713
01:03:23,296 --> 01:03:24,616
完全不是.
Not really.

714
01:03:26,049 --> 01:03:27,608
但是你是德国人.
But you are German.

715
01:03:29,803 --> 01:03:32,716
一个可爱的,羞涩的德国佬.
A sweet, shy Kraut.

716
01:03:35,475 --> 01:03:37,432
一个饥渴的德国佬?
A horny Kraut?

717
01:03:56,203 --> 01:03:58,433
拜托,不要那样做.
Please, don't do that.

718
01:03:59,164 --> 01:04:01,838
是的.非常高的级别!
Yes, very high UP!

719
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:06,819
我结婚了,希尔维.
I'm married, Sylvie.

720
01:04:07,088 --> 01:04:11,241
是吗.我也是.
我不会让你筋疲力竭,你知道。
Are you? So am I.
I won't wear you out, you know.

721
01:04:24,813 --> 01:04:29,569
你很有胆量.我一生中见多了疯狂
的事情.
You have guts. I've seen
some meshuga things in my time...

722
01:04:31,153 --> 01:04:32,507
那就是我不跟党卫军的原因.
That's why I'm not with the SS.

723
01:04:38,576 --> 01:04:43,047
别担心，宝贝。
我不会埋掉你。
Don't worry, sweetie.
I'm not going to grass on you.

724
01:04:54,425 --> 01:04:55,938
包括这里所有的女孩们。
All the girls here are.

725
01:04:56,218 --> 01:04:58,732
西奇夫人。
And Mrs Hirschfeld. Madame.

726
01:04:59,305 --> 01:05:03,538
作为一个Sperre证的交换。
似乎使得俄国佬变得特别饥渴.
In exchange for a Sperre.
Seems to make the Krauts extra horny.

727
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:18,972
现在，我们要不要做点什么？
Now, are we going
to do anything or not?

728
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:21,656
不要。
Don't then.

729
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:25,524
那么，你为什么来这儿？
So why did you come here?

730
01:05:33,045 --> 01:05:35,355
打从我们文雅的绅士们那儿？
From our civilised gentleman?

731
01:05:36,715 --> 01:05:37,864
像个老鼠一样的悬挂着。
Hung like a mouse.

732
01:05:45,515 --> 01:05:47,108
“敬启者”
'To whom it may concern.

733
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:52,550
"沃尔特苏斯坎德已经成为了
第三德国忠实的仆人。"
Walter Suskind has always been
a loyal servant of the Third Reich.'.

734
01:05:52,981 --> 01:05:54,335
好的。好的。
Well, well.

735
01:05:55,858 --> 01:05:59,931
"他支持党卫军，听从责任感的召唤。"
'Who has supported the SS
above and beyond the call of duty.'.

736
01:06:01,322 --> 01:06:02,357
Period.

737
01:06:02,615 --> 01:06:05,733
"他和他的家人均不会有任何方式的抵抗"
'Neither he nor his family
should be impeded in anyway.'.

738
01:06:06,619 --> 01:06:07,689

"佛迪南签名，SIPO和SD的长官"
'Signed Ferdinand Aus der Filnten,
Commander of the SiPo and the SD.'.

740
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:17,126
天哪！你是他的流落的儿子吗？
他的什么？
Bloody hell! Are you his bum boy?
His what?

741
01:06:17,504 --> 01:06:20,178
叛徒！从我这儿滚开！
Traitor! Get the hell away from me!

742
01:06:20,549 --> 01:06:22,825
为了个Sperre证去拍马屁吧。
Licking that scum's arse for a Sperre.

743
01:06:23,134 --> 01:06:25,125
那么你呢？纳粹的贱人。
是的。正确。
And you then? Nazi whore.
Yeah, right.

744
01:06:25,387 --> 01:06:27,264
否则，我现在就坐在云上了。
Otherwise I'd be sitting
on a cloud now.

745
01:06:27,597 --> 01:06:30,350
就像我的奶奶，父母，姐姐，侄女儿们
Just like my grandma, parents,
sister, nieces...

746
01:06:30,683 --> 01:06:32,799
整条街，被带走了。
The whole street, taken away.

747
01:06:33,102 --> 01:06:35,457
他们会在战后回来。
你以为吗？
They'll come home after the war.
You think?

748
01:06:35,771 --> 01:06:38,411
你应该在你的德国佬朋友
小便的时候听说过。
You should hear your Kraut friends
when they're pissed.

749
01:06:38,733 --> 01:06:41,407
你以为呢？
他们永远回不来了。
What are you on about?
They're never coming back.

750
01:06:41,735 --> 01:06:44,887
他们不得不做工。
是吗？全裸着？
They only have to work.
Oh yeah? Completely naked?

751
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:48,231
男人和女人，
妈妈带着他们的孩子？
Men and women,
mothers with their children?

752
01:06:48,617 --> 01:06:51,450
他们让你脱衣服，然后...
They make you take your clothes off.
And then...

753
01:06:51,787 --> 01:06:53,380
然后什么?
Then what?

754
01:06:53,663 --> 01:06:56,223
沐浴.他们说.
In the shower. They say.

755
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,712
却没有水流出来
Except no water comes out.

756
01:07:01,004 --> 01:07:01,994
然后什么?
What then?

757
01:07:03,256 --> 01:07:05,213
什么流出来?
What comes out?

758
01:07:06,342 --> 01:07:09,061
然后什么流出来?
What comes out then?

759
01:07:14,058 --> 01:07:15,014
毒气
Gas.

760
01:07:18,103 --> 01:07:19,252
你也是.
You too.

761
01:07:20,397 --> 01:07:22,911
你,很容易.是的.
You, just as easily. Yes.

762
01:07:23,233 --> 01:07:25,827
你不相信我,是不是?
我应该相信什么?
You don't believe me, do you?
What should I believe?

763
01:07:26,153 --> 01:07:29,191
救生艇不存在.
汉娜,你要死了.
The lifeboat doesn't exist.
Hanna, you're going to die.

764
01:07:29,531 --> 01:07:31,408
停止.你用MAFIER干嘛?
Stop it! What's the mafier with you?

765
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:36,137
我打算用.送他们走向死亡.
我们就是一大堆垃圾.
I disposed of them. Sent them to their
death. We're just a big heap of offal.

766
01:07:36,579 --> 01:07:39,219
你,我和伊冯.
不!
You, me and Yvonne.
No!

767
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:43,188
你不相信我，是不是？
You don't believe me, do you?

768
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:45,365
看着我。
Look at me.

769
01:07:45,963 --> 01:07:47,681
看着我。
Look at me!

770
01:07:47,965 --> 01:07:51,003
看着我，你看什么呢？
Look at me.
What do you see?

771
01:07:52,469 --> 01:07:53,868
你看什么呢？
What do you see?

772
01:07:55,389 --> 01:07:56,709
一个酸菜佬。
A Kraut.

773
01:07:57,391 --> 01:07:59,860
你他妈的酸菜佬。
You're a fucking Kraut.

774
01:08:12,739 --> 01:08:14,457
我死也不干！
I won't bloody do it.

775
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,243
送走人们是一件事。
Sending people away is one thing.

776
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:19,803
但是作为屠杀的同谋呢？
你忘了这一点。
But an accessory to murder?
You forgot that bit.

777
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:21,475
苏斯坎德先生。
你是什么意思？
Mr Silskind.
What do you mean?

778
01:08:21,747 --> 01:08:24,739
希特勒在兑现他的承诺。
波兰很厉害，是的
Hitler is doing what he promised!
Poland is tough, yes.

779
01:08:25,084 --> 01:08:28,793
饥荒和瘟疫并行，
人们不得不努力干活。
There's hunger, people have to work
very hard, there are diseases.

780
01:08:29,421 --> 01:08:31,890
别胡扯了！
他们被杀害了。
Don't bullshit me!
They're being murdered.

781
01:08:32,257 --> 01:08:35,534
被歼灭，屠杀，像蝼蚁一样
Annihilated,
exterminated like... vermin.

782
01:08:35,886 --> 01:08:36,921
请你停止行吗？
Will you stop, please?

783
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:39,568
又是那个毒气卡车的恐怖故事吗？
That horror story
about gas trucks again?

784
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:41,403
你从那儿得来的消息？
Where did you get that from?

785
01:08:41,725 --> 01:08:45,081
从一个为党卫军工作的人那儿。
一个犹太女人。
From someone who works
for the SS. A Jewess.

786
01:08:45,395 --> 01:08:48,945
她为党卫军工作？
一个妓女，通敌者。
Who works for the SS?
A tart! Horizontal collaboration.

787
01:08:49,315 --> 01:08:50,271
胡扯！
Bullshit!

788
01:08:50,483 --> 01:08:54,477
我听说了。在公园里。
由尤拉经营的妓院。
I've heard of it. By the park.
The brothel run by Ulla Hirschfeld.

789
01:08:54,862 --> 01:08:57,854
即便她说的是真的，
你想让我们怎么做？
Even if what she says is true,
what would you have us do?

790
01:08:58,199 --> 01:09:01,032
我们能怎么做？
停止，就是停止！
What can we do?
Stop, just stop!

791
01:09:01,368 --> 01:09:03,678
把礼堂(剧院)留给纳粹？
Leave the theatre to the Nazis?

792
01:09:04,038 --> 01:09:05,790
做点事情。让人们知道！
Do something. Let people know!

793
01:09:06,081 --> 01:09:09,073
我不想在礼堂(剧院)里爆发恐慌。
I wouldn't want panic
to break out in the theatre.

794
01:09:09,418 --> 01:09:12,456
荷兰还剩下多少？
40000还是50000？
How many are left in Holland?
40 or50,000?

795
01:09:12,796 --> 01:09:16,187
他们全部将被毒杀。
你想让他们怎么办？
They're all going to be gassed.
What do you want them to do?

796
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:19,064
我怎么知道？藏起来！做点什么。
How do I know? Go into hiding!
Do something.

797
01:09:19,386 --> 01:09:20,740
那是被禁止的。
That's forbidden.

798
01:09:21,012 --> 01:09:23,526
禁止!去他的！
他们要灭族！
Forbidden? Goddammit!
They're wiping us out!

799
01:09:25,433 --> 01:09:27,822
藏匿的人群对我们的社会是个危险
People in hiding
are a danger to our community.

800
01:09:28,144 --> 01:09:30,863
这必然导致复仇。
It inevitably leads to reprisals.

801
01:09:31,188 --> 01:09:33,304
照顾好人民是我们的责任。
It is our duty
to take care of our people.

802
01:09:33,566 --> 01:09:36,877
解决温饱，医疗，减轻创痛。
Feed them, give them
medical assistance, alleviate the pain.

803
01:09:37,278 --> 01:09:40,031
我们不可能，也做不了，更多的事。
We cannot, may not, do more.

804
01:09:41,115 --> 01:09:43,391
我不能，你不能。
Not I, not you.

805
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,963
真是个人道主义者。
A true Humanist.

806
01:09:48,246 --> 01:09:50,396
科恩先生战前不是个教授吗？
Wasn't Mr Cohen
a professor before the war?

807
01:09:50,749 --> 01:09:52,706
古文学科的。
世界上，我仍旧如是。
Of Classics.
I still am, actually.

808
01:09:53,001 --> 01:09:57,120
你是个为纳粹工作的从业者。
那是你。我请辞。
You're an undertaken for the Nazi's.
That's what you are. I quit.

809
01:09:59,799 --> 01:10:02,109
我能给你个忠告吗?
继续下去吗？
Can I give you a word of advice?
Just carry on?

810
01:10:02,427 --> 01:10:04,543
恩。
自己干。
Yes.
Do it yourself.

811
01:10:05,847 --> 01:10:07,645
你已经有了联络渠道。
You've got the contacts.

812
01:10:11,977 --> 01:10:14,537
你认为我为什么给你这个工作？
Why did you think I gave you the job?

813
01:10:15,939 --> 01:10:18,852
因为你的钢琴表演艺术吗？
Because of your virtuoso piano playing?

814
01:10:23,238 --> 01:10:24,467
那么你...
So you...

815
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:38,349
你怎么能知道我...
你这么勇敢?我不知道.
How could you know that I'd...
That you were so brave? I didn't.

816
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:41,320
但是你不得不继续下去。
But you have to carry on.

817
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:44,809
我们命该如此。所有人。
We're doomed anyway. All of us.

818
01:11:05,904 --> 01:11:08,783
炸弹掉在了每个人的头上。
Just bomb the shit out of it all.

819
01:11:09,115 --> 01:11:12,028
礼堂(剧院)，铁路。
The theatre, the railway.

820
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:14,359
西波克，奥斯奇。
Westerbork, Auschwitz.

821
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:17,009
他们为什么？
A few bombs and it's done with.
Why would they?

822
01:11:17,331 --> 01:11:18,321
该死的英国人。
Damn English.

823
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,691
所有的一切为了赢得战争。
It's all about winning the war.

824
01:11:21,001 --> 01:11:24,312
我为什么要关心谁书谁赢呢？
如果我不在那儿也看不见？
Why should I care who wins the war
if I won't be there to see it?

825
01:11:35,348 --> 01:11:38,101
我不认目睹他们。我说不出话。
I can't stand the sight of them,
I can't breathe language.

826
01:11:38,476 --> 01:11:40,035
该死的德国佬。
Damn Krauts.

827
01:11:41,187 --> 01:11:42,860
我们能找到他吗？
Shall we get him?

828
01:11:50,571 --> 01:11:52,209
他们怎么来这儿？
How did they get here?

829
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:55,528
妈妈不会让我跟着她的。
毛裴也不会。
Mummy wouldn't let me go with her.
Maupie neither.

830
01:12:06,503 --> 01:12:09,780
我要把你放那儿呢，孩子？
Where am I going to put you, child?

831
01:12:11,383 --> 01:12:12,339
过来。
Come on.

832
01:12:19,849 --> 01:12:22,841
没问题，人人需要孩子。
毛裴。
No problem. Everybody wants babies.
Maupie.

833
01:12:23,186 --> 01:12:26,178
真可爱。但递交给女孩们。
Cute. But please leave
the deliveries to the girls.

834
01:12:26,522 --> 01:12:28,832
一个带孩子的男人太可疑了。
但是我们在酒吧见面。
A man with a baby is suspicious.
But we meet in a bar.

835
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:31,744
这儿？他们是共产党。每个人都是。
Here? They're Communists,
every one of them.

836
01:12:32,069 --> 01:12:34,788
毛裴也有一个姐姐。
9岁大，莫扎。
Maupie's got a sister too.
Nine years old, Mirjam.

837
01:12:35,114 --> 01:12:39,073
好的。但是不太犹太化。
没人要他们。
Fine, but nothing too Jewish.
No-one wants them.

838
01:12:39,451 --> 01:12:42,330
那么我把这女孩放哪儿呢？
棚里满了。
Where do I put the girl then?
The shed is full.

839
01:12:42,621 --> 01:12:44,851
这有一个蓝眼睛的孩子么？
Isn't there one with blue eyes?

840
01:12:45,165 --> 01:12:48,362
看上去不太犹太。
那么她就能跟我走。
Just less obviously Jewish.
Then she can come with me.

841
01:12:50,378 --> 01:12:51,732
不太犹太？
Less Jewish?

842
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:57,321
来吧。小姑娘，坐这儿。
Come on, little girl, sit here.

843
01:12:58,594 --> 01:12:59,629
快点
Hurry UP...

844
01:13:03,099 --> 01:13:05,215
抓牢了。我们走了。
Hold on tight. Here we go.

845
01:13:05,726 --> 01:13:07,603
鲁斯！
Roos!

846
01:13:07,937 --> 01:13:10,372
鲁斯！鲁斯！
Roos! Roos!

847
01:13:34,712 --> 01:13:35,907
Henneicke Column.

848
01:13:38,466 --> 01:13:40,264
Henneicke Column?

849
01:13:40,551 --> 01:13:42,667
从没听说过。
你想跟我说话吗？
Never heard of it.
You wanted to speak to me?

850
01:13:43,012 --> 01:13:46,004
不。只是需要你在交接单上签名。
No. Just need you to sign for delivery.

851
01:13:46,348 --> 01:13:48,783
什么？
她藏起来了。在伦特恩。
Of what?
She was in hiding. In Lunteren.

852
01:13:50,936 --> 01:13:52,529
如果我不签名呢？
And what if I don't sign?

853
01:13:52,813 --> 01:13:55,726
那我就拿不到工钱了。
值7块五
Then I don't get my money, you sod.
That's worth seven-fifty!

854
01:13:56,066 --> 01:13:58,216
酬劳？抱歉。没门
A reward? Sorry, no chance.

855
01:13:58,526 --> 01:14:02,360
那么我带她去SD。没问题。她属于这儿
Then I'll take her to the SD.
Out of the question. She belongs here.

856
01:14:02,697 --> 01:14:04,768
现在听我说，仔细点，我的朋友。
Now listen to me
very carefully, my friend.

857
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:07,429
我让你干你的活，
所以你也让我干活。
I let you do your bloody work
so let me do mine.

858
01:14:07,702 --> 01:14:08,817
你称之为干活？
不。
You call this work?
No.

859
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:12,628
我的干劲儿。我的活是清空地方，发送货物去柏林拍卖。
My passion. My work is emptying houses
Sending stuff to Berlin for auction.

860
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,360
犹太人这样的货物
Jews' stuff.

861
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,415
挣犹太人的钱？
And the money from the 'Jews' stuff?

862
01:14:16,669 --> 01:14:20,583
别抱怨了。过去当然都是坐车花钱的。
Stop whining. It's used to pay
for the trains, of course.

863
01:14:21,006 --> 01:14:23,236
为了他们自己的运输业花钱。
They pay for their own transport.

864
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:26,845
呆在这儿！让我走！
Stay here! Let go of me!

865
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:39,460
开枪！开枪！
Shoot then! Shoot!

866
01:14:40,149 --> 01:14:42,425
你在等什么?
需要我指给你吗？
What are you waiting for?
Need me to show you how?

867
01:14:43,403 --> 01:14:44,598
让我躲开枪。
Let go of my gun!

868
01:15:03,005 --> 01:15:03,961
出去这条路。
Out the way.

869
01:15:08,218 --> 01:15:10,209
他们接下来再藏哪儿？
Where will they hide next?

870
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:34,535
疼吗？
只在我笑得时候。
Does it hurt?
Only when I laugh.

871
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:36,620
芬妮怎么办？
What will happen to Fanny?

872
01:15:36,912 --> 01:15:38,630
如果她说出来怎么办？
What if she talks?

873
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:41,110
说点什么吧，沃尔特。
他们来了怎么办？
Say something, Walter.
What if they come here?

874
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:44,249
不会的。你不认识她。
你也不认得盖斯特普
Won't happen. You don't know her.
And you don't know the Gestapo.

875
01:15:44,878 --> 01:15:48,269
别傻了。
你是个叛徒。好好想想吧。
Don't be so stupid!
You're a traitor, think about it.

876
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:50,622
你已经是费尔长官同一条船了
You've taken Aus der Filnten for a ride.

877
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:52,154
真可怕，是不是？
Terrible, isn't it?

878
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:55,306
你已经做的足够了。你不是上帝。
救世主沃尔特。
You've done enough, you're not God!
Walter the Messiah.

879
01:15:55,638 --> 01:15:59,108
我们去度假。
我们得藏起来。现在！
We'll go on holiday.
We're going into hiding. Now!

880
01:15:59,475 --> 01:16:01,307
他们会逮捕大家。皮耶特，费列克斯
They'll arrest everyone. Piet, Felix...

881
01:16:01,602 --> 01:16:04,720
又来了，救世主沃尔特！
我们得走了。
There, Walter the Messiah again!
We have to leave.

882
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:06,982
我们搞到了那些石头。
We've got those stones.

883
01:16:24,916 --> 01:16:26,475
有芬妮的消息吗？
Any news of Fanny?

884
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:30,145
她在明天的四点半火车上。
该死！
She's on the half-four train tomorrow.
Dammit!

885
01:16:30,505 --> 01:16:33,657
她跟他们说出什么了吗？
那么他们已经埋伏在那儿了。
Did she tell them anything?
Then they'd already be here.

886
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:36,427
我们怎么把她弄下来。
How can we get her off there?

887
01:16:41,306 --> 01:16:43,456
中央局分局
Pinched from the Central Bureau.

888
01:16:44,852 --> 01:16:47,082
一个逮捕证明。
An arrest warrant.

889
01:16:47,396 --> 01:16:49,672
谁逮捕谁。
你逮捕芬妮。
And who will arrest who?
You, Fanny.

890
01:16:51,566 --> 01:16:55,446
他们什么理由下来？
一点骗术，一点演技。
And they'll fall for that?
A bit of bluffing, play-acting.

891
01:16:55,779 --> 01:16:58,897
你是剧院的经理，不是吗？
You are a theatre manager,
aren't you?

892
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:01,539
明天见。
See you tomorrow.

893
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,519
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

894
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:08,568
我要离开，和伊冯一起。
I'm leaving. With Yvonne!

895
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:11,070
我们还来得及跑掉。
We can still get away.

896
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:13,254
那么帮助我。
Help me then!

897
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:20,474
在你知道以前，T军和红军就会来这里
并且你...
Before you know it, the Tommies
and the Reds will be here and you...

898
01:17:20,844 --> 01:17:23,313
还在抽雪茄吗?
和那个老乡.
will still be smoking cigars
with that clown.

899
01:17:23,638 --> 01:17:25,117
他是不可或缺的。
He is indispensable.

900
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:26,903
For the saboteurs, yes.

901
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:30,536
她在独自表演。她说她会尽力带
她的侄子逃走。
She was acting alone. She said she was
trying to get her nephew away.

902
01:17:30,895 --> 01:17:33,569
她在明天的火车上。
跟你一样。
She's on tomorrow's train.
As will you be.

903
01:17:33,898 --> 01:17:35,889
一张去高加索的单程票。
A one-way ticket to the Caucasus.

904
01:17:37,568 --> 01:17:41,801
我不干。我们在这儿的工作
一个月后就结束了。清除犹太人。
I wouldn't do that. Our work here'll be
finished in a month. Cleansed of Jews.

905
01:17:42,531 --> 01:17:44,204
多亏我和这个老乡
Thanks to me and to this clown.

906
01:17:45,576 --> 01:17:49,615
他会让你包裹起你的手。
我会拷问他。
He's got you wrapped round his finger.
I'll give him a good grilling.

907
01:17:50,205 --> 01:17:55,279
真的？不要忘了带上你的天鹅绒手套
Really? Don't forget to
wear your velvet gloves.

908
01:17:57,671 --> 01:17:59,821
苏斯坎德不会出卖我的。
Silskind wouldn't betray me.

909
01:18:00,799 --> 01:18:04,952
盖斯特普保监令
GESTAPO
PROTECTIVE CUSTODY ORDER

910
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,114
太棒了。事情应该成了。
Brilliant. That should do it.

911
01:18:13,436 --> 01:18:14,790
我们期望如此吧。
Let's hope so.

912
01:18:17,064 --> 01:18:18,259
菲利普...
Philips...

913
01:18:18,524 --> 01:18:20,322
菲利普,芬妮.把她留在那儿.
Philips, Fanny. Leave her on there.

914
01:18:20,568 --> 01:18:23,481
只是中央局来的.
名单上的就是名单上的.
This is from the Central Bureau.
On the list is on the list.

915
01:18:23,862 --> 01:18:25,580
命令就是命令.
西波克.
An order's an order.
Westerbork.

916
01:18:25,906 --> 01:18:29,297
不,不是西波克.
毛斯,马上.
No, not Westerbork.
Mauthausen, right away.

917
01:18:29,618 --> 01:18:32,053
叛徒.
她是个罪人
The traitor.
She's a criminal.

918
01:18:32,371 --> 01:18:35,124
跟你一样.上车.
或者你需要帮助吗?
As are you! Get on the train.
Or do you need help?

919
01:18:35,457 --> 01:18:37,255
兹莫...
我在名单上吗?
Zimmermann...
Am I on that list?

920
01:18:37,542 --> 01:18:40,773
我不在乎.你也可以走了.
你知道谁划的名单吗?我!
I don't care. You can go too.
D'you know who draws the lists up? Me!

921
01:18:41,963 --> 01:18:45,035
我做的!
然后我将亲自加上你的名字.
I do!
Then I will personally add your name.

922
01:18:45,383 --> 01:18:46,976
是什么?
苏斯坎德.
What is it?
Silskind.

923
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,297
和你的,霍尔?
And yours, Herr Rottenï¬‚lhrer?

924
01:18:55,351 --> 01:18:57,422
斯查
Scharï¬‚lhrer Schiinfeld.

925
01:18:57,728 --> 01:19:01,244
现在上车.斯查.
Now get on the train.
Scharï¬‚lhrer Schiinfeld.

926
01:19:01,565 --> 01:19:03,397
如果你一定要就把我放上车吧.
Put me on the train if you must.

927
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:06,369
但我能确保你会乘上下一班.
But I can assure you that
you will be on the next one.

928
01:19:06,653 --> 01:19:09,406
并且车不会在西波克停.
And it won't stop at Westerbork.

929
01:19:11,908 --> 01:19:13,706
停下火车!
Stop the train!

930
01:19:27,006 --> 01:19:27,962
谢谢.
Thank you.

931
01:19:41,186 --> 01:19:43,826
向你祝贺.
做的好.做的很好.
My compliments.
Well done. Very well done.

932
01:19:44,147 --> 01:19:45,501
什么事这么紧急?
What was so urgent?

933
01:19:45,732 --> 01:19:47,484
你的朋友
Your friend.

934
01:19:47,734 --> 01:19:51,125
在2天的时间里,他想要一半的白袖章
In two days' time
he wants half of all the white armbands,

935
01:19:51,488 --> 01:19:54,799
7000人,被驱逐.
7,000 people, to be deported.

936
01:19:56,784 --> 01:19:59,742
他们很迅速.
阿姆斯特丹已经肃清了犹太人.
They're in a hurry.
Amsterdam has been cleansed of Jews.

937
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:02,753
如果不剩犹太人了还要
犹太理事会干嘛?
Why have a Jewish Council
if there are no Jews left?

938
01:20:03,082 --> 01:20:09,192
当然,科恩顽劣的抵抗?
科恩跟他们花了一上午.
Cohen protested fiercely, of course?
Cohen spent the morning with them

939
01:20:09,672 --> 01:20:12,710
想法从名单上废除30个名字
and managed to get thirty names
scrapped from the list.

940
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:15,929
那30个明天就能得到豁免信.
Those thirty will get
an exemption letter tomorrow

941
01:20:16,261 --> 01:20:18,571
告诉他们不必报告。
telling them they don't have to report.

942
01:20:18,889 --> 01:20:21,529
艾斯和肯恩签署。
Signed by Asscher and Cohen.

943
01:20:23,226 --> 01:20:28,175
你意思是我能不能够制作7000多的信件?
为什么？那么做有什么好处？
You mean can I make 7,000 more letters?
Why? What good will that do them?

944
01:20:28,606 --> 01:20:31,325
那会给他们一点转寰的时间。
获得自由的一线希望。
It'd give them a little extra time.
A glimpse of freedom.

945
01:20:31,651 --> 01:20:33,801
幻觉式的抉择。
The illusion of a choice.

946
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:47,474
我们现在有多少了？
超过6000.
How many have we got now?
Over 6,000.

947
01:20:48,584 --> 01:20:51,337
这个把戏可能以他的脑袋为代价。
谁的？
This trick could cost him his head.
Who?

948
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:53,623
我们的豪普。
Our Hauptsturmï¬‚lhrer.

949
01:20:53,922 --> 01:20:55,640
复仇很酷。
Revenge is sweet.

950
01:20:55,924 --> 01:20:59,235
我不真的想复仇。
但他也许想。
I don't really want revenge.
But he might.

951
01:21:14,567 --> 01:21:15,841
Achtung!

952
01:21:26,703 --> 01:21:30,936
苏斯坎德？苏斯坎德？
我的犹太人呢？
Silskind? Silskind?
Where are my Jews?

953
01:21:33,168 --> 01:21:34,681
你，起来！
You, get up!

954
01:21:36,046 --> 01:21:37,400
苏斯坎德在哪儿？
Where is Silskind?

955
01:21:37,672 --> 01:21:39,743
我在问你！
I asked you a question!

956
01:21:40,091 --> 01:21:41,889
让他们滚开，全部！
Get them out of here. All of them!

957
01:21:42,176 --> 01:21:45,168
是的，长官！出去，大家出去！
Yes, sir! Get out, everybody out!

958
01:21:46,305 --> 01:21:47,579
出去，我说。
Out, I said.

959
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:49,778
你聋了吗？出去！
Are you deaf? Out!

960
01:21:50,393 --> 01:21:51,792
那是我说的。
That's what I'm saying.

961
01:21:52,061 --> 01:21:57,181
听着，科恩先生。我可以向你保证。
这对我也是个秘密。
Listen, Mr Cohen. I can assure you,
it's a mystery to me too.

962
01:21:57,691 --> 01:21:59,602
稍等。
Just a moment.

963
01:22:03,155 --> 01:22:04,475
上帝。
My God.

964
01:22:05,991 --> 01:22:09,063
带两个人把全部人赶出去。
Take two men and
get them all out of there.

965
01:22:09,411 --> 01:22:12,005
是的，长官！
你跟我去，你也去。
Yes, sir!
You, come with me. You too.

966
01:22:23,341 --> 01:22:25,696
我其余的7000犹太人在哪儿？
Where's the rest of my 7,000 Jews?

967
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,558
我在等他们。
I'm waiting for them.

968
01:22:30,597 --> 01:22:31,712
时间还早。
It's still early.

969
01:22:35,143 --> 01:22:36,941
跪下！
On your knees!

970
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:38,544
手放背后。
Hands behind your back.

971
01:23:02,586 --> 01:23:03,860
手举过头
Hands behind your head.

972
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:15,952
如果我扣动扳机会发生什么？
What will happen
if I pull the trigger now?

973
01:23:16,266 --> 01:23:17,745
那么我就完了。
Then I'll be gone.

974
01:23:17,976 --> 01:23:19,375
我是说，冲着我的话。
I mean, to me.

975
01:23:21,729 --> 01:23:24,005
你认为我会哀悼你的死吗？
Do you think I will mourn your death?

976
01:23:25,733 --> 01:23:27,531
是的，我认为我会想念你。
Yes, I think I would miss you.

977
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:30,830
你不必要开枪。
You don't have to shoot.

978
01:23:31,113 --> 01:23:34,026
不，我知道。我自己有一个愿望。
No, I know. I have a will of my own.

979
01:23:34,367 --> 01:23:36,040
我可以选在不开枪。
I can choose not to shoot.

980
01:23:37,828 --> 01:23:40,342
也或许无论如何都会毙了你。
Or maybe I'll shoot you anyway.

981
01:23:40,664 --> 01:23:42,541
如果你杀了我。
If you kill me

982
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:46,906
你真的认为那七千人会出现吗
do you really think
those 7,000 will turn up?

983
01:23:50,423 --> 01:23:53,222
该死的！
我会为此掉脑袋！
Dammit!
They'll have my head for this!

984
01:23:53,551 --> 01:23:56,748
你没有做错什么。
这超出了你的控制。
You didn't do anything wrong.
It's beyond your control.

985
01:23:57,138 --> 01:23:59,129
告诉斯特
Tell Sturmbannï¬‚lhrer Lages that.

986
01:24:00,725 --> 01:24:04,275
有人欺骗了我们，背叛了我们。
Someone deceived us. Betrayed us.

987
01:24:08,357 --> 01:24:12,032
继续，走。
容易，容易。
Go on. Move.
Easy, easy.

988
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,235
快点
Faster!

989
01:24:24,414 --> 01:24:26,246
不！
No!

990
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,104
No!

991
01:24:28,752 --> 01:24:29,822
Aaron!

992
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:39,251
上来！
呆在你的地方。
Up there!
Stay where you are!

993
01:24:41,389 --> 01:24:43,983
再快点。
Faster!

994
01:25:15,254 --> 01:25:16,608
希尔维？
Sylvie?

995
01:25:26,849 --> 01:25:28,362
继续。
Go on.

996
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:33,863
来吧。
我们要去哪儿？
Come on.
Where are we going?

997
01:25:34,106 --> 01:25:35,176
安静点，恩？
Quietly, eh?

998
01:25:40,236 --> 01:25:45,026
集中精力。
下一个。过来。
Mind your head.
Next one. Come on.

999
01:25:51,914 --> 01:25:54,110
我早上会多带点来。
I'll bring some more in the morning.

1000
01:26:02,424 --> 01:26:04,222
去睡觉。
Go to sleep.

1001
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:09,363
晚安。
Goodnight.

1002
01:26:38,167 --> 01:26:42,240
你们的老乡现在能随心所欲的
腊印很多信。
That clown of yours can now stencil
as many letters as he likes.

1003
01:26:51,805 --> 01:26:53,204
苏斯坎德？
Silskind?

1004
01:26:56,309 --> 01:27:00,143
这不是真的。
你是个二百五，豪普。
It's not true.
You're a half-wit, Hauptsturmï¬‚lhrer.

1005
01:27:03,024 --> 01:27:04,094
一个懦夫。
A wimp.

1006
01:27:15,619 --> 01:27:16,973
嗨。打开门!
Hello! Open the door!

1007
01:27:18,955 --> 01:27:20,184
打开。
Open up.

1008
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:23,476
打开，警察。
Open Hp, police.

1009
01:27:34,512 --> 01:27:37,345
过来，让我们去楼上看一下。
Come on, let's take a look upstairs.

1010
01:27:44,188 --> 01:27:45,417
他们走了。
They've gone.

1011
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:47,146
他们不在这儿。
They're not here.

1012
01:28:14,091 --> 01:28:17,721
那很危险。
你应该来里面。
That's dangerous.
You should come inside.

1013
01:28:18,846 --> 01:28:20,120
请原谅
Excuse me.

1014
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,078
对不起，请原谅。
Sorry. Excuse me.

1015
01:28:32,984 --> 01:28:35,817
沃尔特。
希尔维？
Walter.
Sylvie?

1016
01:28:36,404 --> 01:28:40,113
今天上午他们把所有人装走了。
所有的女孩，每个人。
They picked them all up this morning.
All the girls. Everybody.

1017
01:28:40,491 --> 01:28:43,005
哦，不，孩子们呢？
Oh no, and the children?

1018
01:28:43,661 --> 01:28:45,140
他们还在那儿。
They're still there.

1019
01:29:02,262 --> 01:29:04,697
他们都听见我们了。
我打不开。
They'll hear us.
I can't open it.

1020
01:29:07,851 --> 01:29:11,367
我不能让他们挨饿。
我不得不回去。
I can't let them starve.
I have to go back.

1021
01:29:12,522 --> 01:29:13,671
回去？
Back?

1022
01:29:14,274 --> 01:29:15,947
你回不去的。
You can't go back.

1023
01:29:17,652 --> 01:29:19,051
我不得不去
I have to.

1024
01:29:23,949 --> 01:29:25,906
我认识能帮你的某个人。
I know someone who can help me.

1025
01:29:41,675 --> 01:29:43,393
这让我烦透了。
This makes me sick.

1026
01:29:43,677 --> 01:29:45,748
那些女孩怎么办呢？
What about these girls?

1027
01:29:46,304 --> 01:29:48,864
你会怎么抉择呢：
跳舞还是波兰？
What would you choose:
dancing or Poland?

1028
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,118
我们的犹太人党委军
Our Jewish SS.

1029
01:30:02,403 --> 01:30:03,916
回来。
Get back.

1030
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:07,807
干得好。现在你不会被驱逐了。
我说。回来。
Well done. Now you won't be deported.
I said, get back.

1031
01:30:14,623 --> 01:30:16,261
奥伯斯！
Obersturmï¬‚lhrer!

1032
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:19,567
司令认识我。
The Commandant knows me.
I don't give a shit!

1033
01:30:19,878 --> 01:30:21,277
司令！
Commandant!

1034
01:30:22,922 --> 01:30:24,993
我没以前见过面。
对不起，但是现在很忙。
We've met before.
Sorry, but it's urgent.

1035
01:30:25,842 --> 01:30:26,991
对。
Right.

1036
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:29,012
我是礼堂(剧院)的经理。
I'm the theatre manager.

1037
01:30:29,303 --> 01:30:31,453
豪普，在费尔长官的生日上。
Hauptsturmï¬‚lhrer Aus der Fifteenâ€™s
birthday?

1038
01:30:32,265 --> 01:30:35,337
我不记得了。
在阿姆斯特丹。在霍斯夫人家。
I don't remember.
In Amsterdam. At Mrs Hirschfeld's.

1039
01:30:37,811 --> 01:30:39,404
没听说过。带他走开。
Never heard of it. Take him away.

1040
01:30:42,274 --> 01:30:43,503
不。

1056
01:33:09,456 --> 01:33:11,891
他...
不要问任何问题.

火车上.
If you try to cheat me,
they'll be on the very next train.

1073
01:34:41,919 --> 01:34:45,708
如果我不是故意欺骗你呢?
那么她就还是你的.
And if I don't try to cheat you?

1074
01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:47,888
你的和你自己的
Yours and yours alone.

1075

别担心.
她在下一个告示之前有一个SPERRE证.
Don't worry.
She has a Sperre until further notice.

1076
01:34:53,889 --> 01:34:55,641

你认为我也能洗个澡吗?

1082
01:36:30,689 --> 01:36:32,726
你要你保持安静.

足够了.
