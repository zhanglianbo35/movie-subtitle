DIRECTED BY
JAN NEMEC

11
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,038
We were lucky with the weather.

12
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,594
A beautiful day.
The banquet was just as it should be.

13
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,994
You'd make a great defence counsel.
You stand up for your views.

14
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,112
I like good company, good fun,
and good food.

15
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,472
Don't worry, you won't get fat.

16
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,673
It's quite nice to celebrate
and to indulge yourself.

17
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,597
Don't you think?

18
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,471
You don't feel like eating, you're not hungry,
but you fancy something.

19
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,838
So I don't have to tell everyone.
Help yourself. We have to finish it.

20
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,678
It's nice and fresh.

21
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,394
Remember how they brought in the wine?

22
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,154
I know. Shame we didn't have
our swimming costumes.

23
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,189
The water's warm.

24
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,756
Agreed, we all see things differently.

25
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,474
We can't rely on only one opinion.

26
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,039
I'm telling you.
You should have done law.

27
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,269
But it turned out well then, remember?
Us dancing on the boat.

28
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,595
All that sand. Remember?

29
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,035
I thought about it many times.

30
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,674
Or that lamp, remember?

31
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,870
Boy, when I think about it...

32
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,234
When he came to give us a piece of his mind...

33
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,839
Well, you never know!

34
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,072
It's the best thing I've ever eaten.

35
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,393
I'm glad you like it.

36
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,112
No more drinking!

37
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,674
All this makes me terribly drowsy.

38
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,629
Improvisation is the best thing.

39
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,629
I'm also a bit tired.

40
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,598
Really? You can't be!

41
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,358
I couldn't live on my own.

42
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,517
Some people do, but I really couldn't.

43
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,074
I could, I would drink lots.

44
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,995
I like being on my own.

45
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,911
I always do the washing.

46
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,750
I like nice, well-looked-after things.

47
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,678
So do I.

48
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,951
It's really lovely here, isn't it?

49
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,196
Yes, very.

50
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:38,355
If I had a big house...
I mean, if I finally got myself a big house,

51
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,393
I'd invite you all over and I'd...

52
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,075
What are they doing over there?

53
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,395
What's the big idea?

54
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,117
Who's that?

55
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,117
I'll go and ask if you want.

56
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,515
That'll be the beginning of the banquet.

57
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,715
Is that the bride?

58
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,868
Don't be silly. Bride?!

59
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,117
Perhaps they're coming to welcome us.

60
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,437
I'd expect anything of him.
Anything is possible with him.

61
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,758
He always thinks of something really special.

62
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,831
Let's go, hurry up.
Let's not waste time.

63
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,433
That water has to be lukewarm.
Otherwise, as I say...

64
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,518
Then you take it straight out or it'll shrink.

65
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,671
Aren't you worried about your heels?

66
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,719
I'll go barefoot.

67
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,794
- What have you got there?
- Here.

68
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,397
Try it the other way.

69
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,357
My husband gave it to me.

70
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,269
Lovely fragrance.

71
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,837
Don't splash on me!

72
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,154
Sorry.

73
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,155
What would you do?

74
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,114
I'd go. It's an opportunity you don't often get.

75
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,999
I just don't know.

76
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,838
The whole thing seems a bit strange to me.

77
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,350
I agree, but an opportunity like this...

78
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,029
A difficult decision.

79
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,638
I wonder what you'll say when you've read it.

80
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,473
I've already read it.

81
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,879
What do you think, then?

82
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,510
I think I'll go there.

83
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,756
Really? That'd be great.

84
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,113
We'd be there together.

85
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,071
It's lovely here - peace and quiet.

86
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,555
The air must be really healthy.

87
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,998
Those pines, that fragrance, this wood...

88
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,074
Great, isn't it?

89
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,352
Yes, indeed.

90
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,393
- You're not cold, I hope?
- Not at all.

91
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,873
It's pretty dark...

92
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,911
I'd like to buy it.

93
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,553
It's necessary for a good rest.

94
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,478
Sure. At least for a day or two.

95
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,956
I agree.
If we didn't have ours... right?

96
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,798
I think so, too.

97
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,635
Aren't your feet hurting?

98
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,433
Don't you want to change
into your sandals?

99
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,312
I really love you.

100
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,431
Has someone got a knife?

101
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,477
Why do you want a knife?

102
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,635
Can't tell you.

103
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,358
- Aren't you tired?
- No.

104
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,837
Looking forward to it?

105
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,951
- Come on!
- Why?

106
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,357
Has someone got a knife?

107
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,118
On a trip, eh?

108
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,352
Mind your own business.

109
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,471
I said, are you on a trip?

110
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,752
A very good afternoon to you...

111
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,236
Will you let go of me?

112
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,873
So many guests.
Who are they?

113
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,150
I think that was sensible.

114
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,430
I thought they were the guests.

115
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,788
So did I.

116
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,319
So did I.

117
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,078
So did I.

118
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,637
Exactly.

119
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,078
Come on.
This is...

120
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,788
Well, I wonder.
But I'm going to do it.

121
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,115
Don't say anything now.

122
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,992
We can all complain later.

123
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,918
I agree. I think that, really...

124
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,598
How can you?

125
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,438
Be quiet and let me do the talking.

126
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,549
I know.
You're afraid I'll say something.

127
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,910
You don't know who they are.

128
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,674
- They're coming!
- Christ, they're two of a kind!

129
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,314
Be quiet, they can hear you!

130
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,431
Don't laugh, you fool!

131
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,630
I hope you're in a better mood now!

132
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,631
So? Do you like it here?

133
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,033
Nice countryside, eh?

134
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,835
Look, first explain to us
why you brought us here.

135
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,317
What do you want?

136
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,078
And who are you?

137
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,310
But I never spoke to him.

138
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,190
What are we to think of you,

139
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,108
standing there as if you were scared of us?

140
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,230
Stand apart from each other.
Spread a little.

141
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,592
It's for your own good.

142
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,752
You go a bit further.

143
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,352
Try to line up, please.

144
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,717
I don't know. Maybe in alphabetical order.
Perhaps to show your papers.

145
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,357
And we'll line up here.

146
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,358
If they want a roll call...

147
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,837
That's right!

148
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,717
Men here, women there.

149
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,392
Much better.

150
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,352
Here's the door.

151
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,874
You can't go in any more.

152
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,438
You can't climb over the wall
and we lost the key.

153
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,559
Or maybe you've got the key?

154
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,958
They'll have to stay there till the morning.

155
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,877
What a beautiful day. The wood.
The lovely fragrance...

156
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,679
It'll be a lovely night.

157
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,231
It's really lovely here.

158
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,831
A person sometimes needs fresh air.

159
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,638
Yeah, the air's healthy here.

160
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,074
Green grass, birds.

161
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,554
- What a change from the city.
- A bit hot, though.

162
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,399
Soon it'll be evening.

163
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:27,313
Then you'll appreciate
the warm evening, the balmy night.

164
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,432
Just don't be afraid of the dark.

165
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,350
What should I be afraid of?

166
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,994
A pretty lady, for example.

167
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,678
I agree. I am afraid of women.

168
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,157
Some say, "Have a whip ready
when you're meeting a woman."

169
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,158
I'm not courageous enough.

170
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,556
I prefer gentler ways.

171
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,990
What if your wife found out?

172
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,554
I don't have a wife. I'm single.

173
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,398
It's lovely here
and it's been nice chatting with you.

174
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,511
But we'd rather get on with the trip.

175
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,836
You're a right one!

176
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,708
He knows how to sweet-talk everyone.

177
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,199
I'm surprised at you.

178
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,349
Your friend doesn't like me, does he?

179
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,995
No, he's just a serious person.

180
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,119
You see, he's...

181
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,470
I've never seen the like,

182
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,477
especially on a man.

183
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,792
Leave me alone.

184
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,673
- Karel.
- Come on...

185
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,309
Don't be silly. You're not alone here.

186
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,112
Nobody's doing anything to you.

187
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,710
A man's expected to have self-control.

188
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,470
Before I forget, like you said,

189
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,310
it'll be a nice, warm evening.

190
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,989
It is true.
After a hot day, a pleasant evening...

191
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,953
You just stay out of it!

192
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,198
With respect, I'd like to remind you
that I've done nothing against you.

193
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,469
Nor have I.

194
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,473
Nor have I.

195
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,353
Nor have I.

196
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,757
May I venture to ask
what we've got ourselves into?

197
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,112
You don't know?

198
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,434
He doesn't know!

199
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,795
Did you hear that?

200
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,358
I don't know, either. It was all a joke.

201
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,432
- A joke, then?
- All a joke, from the start.

202
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,108
You see, I love the theatre.

203
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,310
How I love the theatre!

204
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,351
I wanted to be an actor.

205
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:12,192
I like reading, singing, outdoor life.
And I'm a good dancer.

206
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,198
I like anything pretty and jolly.

207
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,635
I don't know why am I telling you all this,
why I'm confiding in you.

208
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,433
I somehow feel close to you.

209
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,116
What's the point of it all
if it's not a laugh?

210
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,156
I can tell you, an educated man of the world.

211
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,633
How do you know?

212
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,352
We know everything.

213
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,515
Tonight, I'll be singing at the campfire
and play the guitar.

214
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,510
Let's put an end to all this.

215
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,915
Thank you, my dear friend.

216
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,600
It was like being on the stage.

217
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,709
Thank you.

218
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,752
It was a wonderful and memorable experience.

219
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,077
I'll be always grateful to you.

220
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,677
I need the loo!

221
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,277
Someone take her.

222
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,517
Time for me to go.

223
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,509
Goodbye.

224
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,437
He crossed the line!

225
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,269
Excuse me.

226
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,796
Where are you going?

227
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,309
The banquet's about to start,
why would you go?

228
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,636
Can't you take a joke?

229
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,558
Didn't you hear me say it was a joke?

230
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,675
A joke!

231
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,957
You all go after him!

232
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,350
And he won't leave me be!

233
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,913
I don't want to hear any more.
The young lady told me everything.

234
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,433
I told you to bring them the shortest way
but I never allowed you your silly games.

235
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,278
They're distinguished guests.
What must they think of me?

236
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,789
Horsing around on my birthday!

237
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,549
I won't stand for it on my birthday!

238
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,598
I'm telling you...

239
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,634
Hello. How are you?

240
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,548
No, no, no...

241
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,148
We've been waiting just for you.

242
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,158
What took you so long?
And what are you doing?

243
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,996
This is not possible.

244
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,111
Rudolf...

245
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,714
You'll apologise this minute!

246
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,833
- Hello.
- Boy, oh, boy...

247
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,159
My apologies. Will you forgive me?

248
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,638
Brush, towel.

249
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,398
Tidy him up.

250
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,233
Excuse me.

251
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,156
That gentleman was very unpleasant.

252
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,590
I don't know what to say. It all happened
practically in my own house.

253
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,110
Actually, this will be a playing field.

254
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,957
Yes, a playing field.

255
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,399
An excellent idea.

256
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,750
Maybe it is,

257
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,792
but please, don't spare me.

258
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,275
Tell me straight,

259
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,469
how could this have happened?

260
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,037
Sorry.

261
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,034
I know it wasn't a nice welcome.

262
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,437
Nothing like that has ever happened to me.
It's completely thrown me.

263
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,629
We'll have to talk together later.

264
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,796
It really wasn't nice.

265
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:55,552
I like jokes, but that was too much.
Beating up a man...

266
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,999
No-one beat me up.

267
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,872
But they harassed you.

268
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,273
What about human rights?

269
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,472
Come off it, will you? Shut up.

270
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,790
So they harassed you.

271
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,277
Not the way you think.
They kept pushing us about and laughing.

272
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,799
I was scared.

273
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,435
How could we know?
They took us away and kept laughing.

274
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,632
I don't know. It wasn't pleasant.

275
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,591
But it's true...

276
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,234
I don't know.

277
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,638
So they harassed the guests.

278
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,149
I don't know either.
Maybe I'm wrong.

279
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,872
I'm still not myself.

280
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,116
You and your hanky!

281
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,313
I'm sorry.

282
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,228
So will someone tell me what happened or not?

283
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,148
A brother shouldn't turn against his brother.

284
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,434
And a guest shouldn't turn against a guest.

285
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,831
So those are all guests?

286
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,350
Yes. You're all my guests.

287
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,390
Rudolf, whom I adopted yesterday,
is my adopted son.

288
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,795
He's a gifted actor.

289
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,399
I think so, too.

290
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,193
You're a natural actor.

291
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,833
Isn't he?

292
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,836
A play is a play, friends, nothing more.

293
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,757
We just played out a little joke.

294
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,796
Karel will admit
he should have observed the rules.

295
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,070
The rules set by these gentlemen.

296
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,918
Why bother arguing about it?

297
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,388
I told you it was a joke.

298
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,670
But you tripped me up.

299
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,439
Because you threw things at me
and pushed me about.

300
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,951
You don't like me.

301
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,836
I wonder what I'll learn next.

302
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,996
Boys, boys!

303
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,951
Now, now, now...

304
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,956
We know Rudolf's a naughty boy, but Karel?

305
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,311
You should have seen him sulking,
being naughty!

306
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,396
Because he's an old rebel.

307
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,036
No, I'm a democrat.

308
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,071
So am I.

309
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,270
So am I.

310
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,515
So am I.

311
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,995
With your permission, so am I.

312
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,199
Having your little joke at my expense.

313
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,073
You'll get on well together.

314
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,555
I wondered who they could be.

315
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,196
We were just standing there.
But I thought it might be a joke!

316
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,199
What's the guest list doing here?
Who's put it here?

317
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,676
So, boys, the table, the chairs.
Put all this back where you found it!

318
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,199
Don't scratch it!

319
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:58,471
I'll have to change out of my shoes to get down.

320
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,637
But still, it's a good short cut!

321
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,548
A pity you're all wearing nice shoes.

322
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,710
But we'll see about that.

323
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,952
It's a good short cut.

324
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,073
You'd better change
into more comfortable shoes.

325
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,113
Otherwise my boys will have to carry you.

326
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,353
- Your slippers!
- My husband's old pair.

327
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,198
I took them just in case.

328
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,993
Come on, we'll be there in a minute.

329
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,108
Know what I'm looking forward to most?

330
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,630
When we all sit round the table together!

331
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,229
We'll be there in no time.
But please go carefully!

332
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,549
We don't want you to fall down!

333
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,752
Every morning, we had to pull the curtains
so the sun didn't shine onto our bed.

334
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,678
The morning sun gives my wife a headache.

335
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,395
Eastern wind brings here the smell of the pines.

336
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,197
There's a pine wood with lots of mushrooms.
The smell reaches all the way down to the lake.

337
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:47,634
Look for the lake's surface between the trees!
Here we are!

338
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,194
- Is there anything more beautiful?
- No.

339
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:57,148
I want this rock for my garden,

340
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,589
for when we build the path.

341
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,712
All this path will be made into steps.

342
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,913
They'll connect the playing field with the lake.
And now walk carefully.

343
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,673
And look out, we'll see the lake now.
Here it is.

344
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,360
What a wonderful sight!

345
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,791
Did you hear about the steps?

346
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,956
I'm dying for a drink.

347
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:26,632
You'll soon have everything.
We'll have dinner by the lake.

348
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,673
You'll see the candelabras I told you about.

349
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,872
They saw you this afternoon.
Did you see her too?

350
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,673
We were up there.
We came from the village.

351
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,349
So it was you?
We thought it was a procession for the birthday.

352
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,555
Olinka got married
and they'll have dinner with us.

353
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,356
So there'll be two dinners -
wedding and birthday.

354
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,677
I'm really glad you've all seen each other.

355
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,189
People belong to people.

356
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,515
We were surprised your veil was blowing about.

357
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,279
It's windy up there.

358
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,675
It's usually windy at the top.

359
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,398
Please accept our congratulations.

360
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,354
All the best.
I mean it very sincerely.

361
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,990
So you saw each other.

362
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,395
They at the top and you at the bottom!

363
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,990
That's just as it should be!

364
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,478
Stop it!

365
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,478
Leave him, you only get married once.

366
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:12,436
He's a nice lad and life's meant to be lovely.

367
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,512
It's starting now, no more talking.

368
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,320
We'll talk after dinner.

369
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,396
If it suits you, I'd be most glad.

370
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,910
Not to keep you in suspense, it turned out OK.
We'll be phoning them.

371
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,155
Really?

372
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,111
How can I express...

373
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,389
Come off it.

374
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,999
At least think of me!

375
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,272
You can't do this, you'll never get anywhere.
And what about me?

376
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,960
Such an opportunity like this one...

377
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,629
Let's go!

378
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,594
It's starting!

379
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,918
All protagonists get into the limelight!

380
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,828
We'll be sitting at the head of the table!

381
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,157
You on the right, me on the left.

382
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,115
I immediately took a liking to you.

383
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,312
You'll sit with Rudolf and me here.

384
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,477
The bride and groom will sit opposite us.

385
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,912
And what about you?
You're not angry at me any more, are you?

386
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,156
Why should I be?
I was never angry at you.

387
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,308
Come, come.
Let's have a drink together.

388
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,477
What's the matter?

389
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,797
For Christ's sake, what's happened?

390
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,629
My husband...

391
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,752
What? What are you saying?

392
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,878
Come on. What's the matter?

393
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,959
Come on...

394
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,110
Will someone tell me or not?

395
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,838
Wipe your eyes and tell us what happened,

396
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,995
what the matter is.

397
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,519
Her husband's run off.

398
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,036
He doesn't want to be here.
He doesn't want to be at the banquet.

399
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,152
We can begin.

400
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,478
Dear guests, ladies and gentlemen!

401
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,593
Let's raise our glasses
to commence our banquet.

402
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:28,714
And hear a few words from our dear friend...

403
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,149
No speeches, if you please.

404
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,792
...dear friend...

405
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,189
...to whom we'll drink
a toast from the heart.

406
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,915
Why no speeches?

407
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,315
You're a wonderful speaker!

408
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,468
Shut up and eat!

409
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,791
But this isn't my place!

410
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,957
This isn't my name!

411
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,430
Who's sitting in my place?

412
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,672
I want to sit in my place or my husband's!

413
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,753
I'm in your place
because you sat in the wrong place.

414
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,519
Oh, I see. Sorry.

415
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,315
This isn't my place, either.

416
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,833
I couldn't find my name.
Perhaps they forgot about me.

417
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,149
This is the last straw!

418
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,555
I never expected this.
This has never happened to me before!

419
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:58,559
You keep changing places,
making fun of everything!

420
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,315
And one of my guests has run off!

421
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,671
I'm not having any dinner!

422
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,795
I didn't expect

423
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:20,235
my banquet to turn out like this!

424
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,078
The seating order was fine.

425
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,156
What do you mean?

426
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:30,309
Why isn't there a spare seat
if one guest is missing?

427
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,433
What?

428
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,239
One, two, three...

429
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,993
Everything was clearly all right.
It's because the lady sat in the wrong place.

430
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,588
We didn't want to insult a lady.

431
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,430
I'm sorry, I was really so upset...

432
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,552
Don't cry.
It's not your fault, you're a woman.

433
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,629
We have to treat women well.

434
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,313
Why did he leave?

435
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,953
Where did he go?

436
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,119
To the station, I think.

437
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,071
Do you get it?

438
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,156
A guest comes to a banquet.

439
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,874
Suddenly he decides to run off.

440
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,195
I understand a lot of things

441
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,549
but that's the limit!

442
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:32,713
A guest running off,
no-one knows where or why.

443
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,670
Does anyone understand it?

444
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,994
...13, 14...

445
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,711
I don't know.

446
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,991
One simply doesn't know what to think.

447
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,637
He was sitting there, reading, eating,

448
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,276
and drinking coffee, just like us.

449
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,789
Perhaps he's a loner.
Such people...

450
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,519
Oh, no.

451
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,349
He got up in the morning and said,
"It's going to be a lovely day."

452
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,678
We were getting ready for the trip.
I baked the cake which you so enjoyed.

453
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,790
We parked up there, as you told us to,

454
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:20,950
next to the petrol station.
Then we came down that nice winding road.

455
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:27,076
A beautiful journey.
We sat down in the valley, had a picnic.

456
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,915
We looked forward to meeting you.

457
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,554
We talked about you...

458
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,591
We saw you!

459
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,950
And we saw you, too!

460
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,469
I don't agree at all.

461
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,319
He didn't like this gentleman's joke.

462
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,989
Hear that?

463
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,232
Just a moment.

464
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,229
God, this is annoying.

465
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,910
I'd like to ask you something.

466
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,110
Don't start again!

467
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,231
I'll tell you something.

468
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,398
I'll explain why that lady
is sitting on her own.

469
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,233
Want to know?

470
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,479
Do you want to know why her husband
chose to leave? Do you?

471
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,509
Oh, my God!

472
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,189
You're angry with him because of that bag!
That's all.

473
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,151
Stuff the bag!

474
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,114
I don't give a damn about it.
But what about my knife and lighter?

475
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,032
They were in my pocket and I've lost them both.

476
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,668
A bag!
My knife and lighter are gone!

477
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,798
I'm not bothered about those either.
It's the principle I'm bothered about.

478
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,873
No wonder he ran off!

479
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,798
Enough. Let's leave it.

480
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,234
Sorry.

481
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:09,069
No, no, no.
Don't apologise, I must admit you're right.

482
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,311
A pity you didn't say it on the playing field.

483
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,949
It's not a joke any more.

484
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,754
It's... I'll be blunt about it,
it's barbarity.

485
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:26,433
You'll get a new knife and lighter from me!

486
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,828
Now stop being a spoilsport.
You can forget about it now.

487
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,153
Ah! Women, women...

488
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,078
See, they are wise...

489
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,151
A woman knows that you have to forget.
It is a necessity.

490
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,111
I also forgot.

491
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:06,439
I had to forget many things in my life.

492
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,637
So cheer up!

493
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,113
He ran off, so be it.
If that's what he wanted, so what?

494
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,512
To the bride and groom,

495
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,110
lots of luck!

496
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,717
To your health!

497
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,678
Lots of luck!

498
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,916
The chair's here, as you can see. It was OK.

499
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,918
It was there when I first came here.
It was under the table.

500
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,474
I banged my leg when I wanted to sit down.

501
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,113
Come and sit down!

502
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,949
Let's begin!

503
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,991
Get stuck in there!
Chop, chop!

504
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,069
It's cooked right to the bone.

505
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,357
What's so funny?

506
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,991
I found a bit of pine bark.

507
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,751
So big and still playing about.

508
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,159
Was he really a pilot?

509
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,475
Yeah, he was.

510
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,754
Look...

511
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,639
Why are you looking at me like that?
That wouldn't be fair of you.

512
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,038
I'm serious, I'm not flattering you.

513
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,752
I wouldn't know how to.

514
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,918
We transported it at night.
It weighed almost 100 kilos.

515
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,235
That was a lot.

516
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,675
I'll have to tell you in detail.
It's a story you'll enjoy.

517
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,910
It's spoilt my appetite.

518
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,791
I feel like shooting myself.

519
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,710
I've got a gun and bullets.

520
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:20,919
A shot would ring out. I'd be lying there,
blood spurting from my forehead.

521
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,715
You've prepared everything.
You've taken such pains over it.

522
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,635
All I thought about was your birthday.

523
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,671
I dreamed about you.

524
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,512
You were wearing a golden peaked cap.

525
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,838
And now there's an empty chair.

526
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,633
And that wretched man isn't here.

527
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,751
You know who's to blame?

528
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,190
You and your talent.

529
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:00,075
You were so convincing
that we all almost ran away.

530
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,476
You should have gone after him,
told him a few words. He'd have come back.

531
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,559
Shall I go and bring him back?

532
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,513
Yeah, why not?

533
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,074
That would really cheer me up!

534
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,990
So I'll fetch him, OK?

535
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,237
May I? Will you let me?

536
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,760
Go on, then, but no more jokes!

537
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,759
I want the boys to go with me.

538
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,317
Would you tell them to?

539
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,435
Order the guests about?
Tell the guests to leave their dinner?

540
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,278
You tell them.

541
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,679
You're so polite and you're an intellectual.
Tell them.

542
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,199
Tell them a few words.

543
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,709
Thanks for the compliment.

544
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:07,152
But I was not authorised to make speeches.

545
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,632
Feel free to tell them.

546
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,592
By all means, if you feel like it,
why don't you?

547
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,919
Today, anything's allowed!

548
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,836
It's my birthday. Why not?

549
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,390
If anything is allowed, fine.

550
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,798
That's different.
I'll be pleased to make you happy.

551
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,308
Why don't you want to go, or with a friend?

552
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,635
Because it would sadden him.

553
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,514
He's a good chap, but he can't take criticism.

554
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,189
Sure. But I'm not really a speaker.

555
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,558
The guests mostly know your name.

556
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,714
Your words carry weight.

557
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:02,917
And Rudolf deserves it.

558
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,429
It was just a question.
I'd be glad to.

559
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,598
Attention! Quiet please!

560
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,029
Go ahead.

561
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,668
Dear guests!

562
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:27,158
Wedding guests, friends.
My duty makes me appeal to your emotions.

563
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,397
We're all sitting here enjoying ourselves.

564
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,672
But one of us isn't happy.
On the contrary.

565
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,792
He's depressed and in a bad mood.

566
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,470
There's an empty chair in our midst.

567
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,434
It is hankering for the body
which is meant for it,

568
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,472
not the mere spirit of he who left

569
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:54,789
and thus saddened and, dare I say this,
crushed the chief organiser of our banquet.

570
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,909
Let's go!

571
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,073
One for all and all for one!

572
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,715
Let's all go after him and bring him back!

573
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,035
So at last order can be reinstated!

574
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,351
Why not?

575
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,757
Yeah, good idea.

576
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,632
But why all of us?

577
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,558
Because he left us all!

578
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,116
Let's go. Let's go and get him!

579
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,435
How does it feel to be at the helm?

580
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,792
It's nice here, isn't it?

581
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,472
I like surprises.

582
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,751
A surprise, that's really something!

583
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,997
Surprises, yes, great.

584
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:13,591
But you've got great wine here.

585
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,398
Did you notice the chairs?
They are all different.

586
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,910
Did you notice? Yet they all match.

587
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,718
That was done on purpose.

588
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,150
I'll have to have a good look.

589
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,398
Pepa.

590
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,518
When are you going to line us up?

591
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,915
Why aren't you getting the provisions ready?

592
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,838
We're staying here.
We're not going anywhere.

593
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,835
Are you serious?
A sweater in this heat?

594
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,793
You'll remember this,
when I have to tend to you.

595
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,909
Listen, we should stay here
in case he comes back.

596
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,350
He's a stranger here, it'd be embarrassing.

597
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,233
Why not? Stay here if you want,

598
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,590
in case he comes back.
You're right.

599
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,359
I wanted to fire a shot when we found him.

600
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:09,792
To let everybody know we've got him.
That the search is over.

601
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,913
We've still got the raffle to go.
If he came back and we didn't know about it...

602
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,832
Why would he run away
if he wanted to come back?

603
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,632
Everything's possible.

604
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,398
But we'd better stay here.

605
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,834
You must fire a shot if he comes.

606
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,991
And we'll take the dog!

607
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,989
I forgot all about it!
Why didn't I think of it before?

608
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,117
We'll soon find him.

609
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,789
What do you know?
First I'm a guard. I'll end up a rifleman.

610
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,673
Today's been nothing but surprises.
A day full of surprises.

611
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,712
I like that. What a success!

612
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,593
I should change my shoes for the journey,
don't you think?

613
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,119
You're all ready.

614
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,038
You stay here
in case your husband comes back.

615
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,912
- But I...
- You stay here.

616
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:03,114
But it's not my fault. I know what you mean,
but it's not my fault at all.

617
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,435
Don't take him from me!

618
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,357
I won't let you!

619
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,391
He's not going anywhere!

620
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,829
They are taking me with them,
I have to go.

621
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,120
Don't worry, nothing will happen to me.

622
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,151
I'll come back.

623
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,469
If I don't, plant a rose for me
and water it with tears.

624
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,748
- Is that your husband's slipper?
- It's so tatty...

625
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,552
We need it for the dog.

626
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,951
What a wonderful animal. Look!

627
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,355
An amazing animal. Well-trained.

628
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,917
Often better than any man.
He'll do what you tell him to.

629
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,110
I'll throw a stone for him.

630
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,632
Be careful. He's dangerous. He bites.

631
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:53,512
Right you are.
He must have terrible teeth.

632
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,677
And what about the claws?
Those are real talons.

633
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,911
But especially those teeth.

634
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:05,632
Never mind the teeth. The best thing about him
is his speed. He flies like the wind.

635
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,275
He got two medals. He's a pedigree.

636
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,799
You know what?

637
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:16,630
It must be interesting on a hunt.

638
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:24,835
I've never seen it.
I've never been on a hunt.

639
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,520
Such a hunt...

640
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,509
Show me. Let him go.

641
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,791
I've never seen this.

642
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,634
Go and get him.

643
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,589
Look at him go!

644
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,829
He can't catch the scent.

645
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,919
He can't. See? He's coming back.

646
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,917
Leave him. Wait.

647
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,396
Look at that great body!

648
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,750
Don't let him hurt my husband.
He could tear his new suit.

649
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,111
Don't worry.
He's an intelligent animal. Look.

650
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,994
He's actually got his own method,
a completely individual method.

651
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,029
A good nose, as they say.
See?

652
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,116
Just look.

653
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,073
What did I say? He's on the scent!
He's got it.

654
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,072
He's a lovely animal, but I'm scared.

655
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,078
I'm scared, because still...

656
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,870
Blow out the candles,
we'll keep them for later.

657
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,590
Come on, quick. Let's go!

658
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,269
- We don't have to go anywhere.
- That's great.

659
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,436
Wait... Where's my glass?

660
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:44,232
If you'll excuse me for asking,

661
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,158
now we're alone...

662
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:52,559
What actually happened?
Why is your husband angry?

663
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:02,672
He said he didn't want to be here,
that people don't love each other here.

664
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,598
What happened next?

665
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,677
Tell us,

666
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,679
if it doesn't upset you too much.

667
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,870
There's no hurry.

668
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,672
Can't you see it's my jacket?

669
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,791
Look how they've crumpled it all up!

670
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:29,032
I keep thinking he left because of me,
because they crumpled me up like that.

671
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,108
No, you're wrong.
He never mentioned you.

672
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,154
Forgive me, but he is your husband.

673
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:40,398
Why did he leave alone?
Why didn't he take you with him?

674
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,671
He wanted me to go. I said I wasn't going.

675
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,315
I say, "There's a banquet here,
I'm not going anywhere!"

676
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,839
How interesting.

677
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,431
How strange.

678
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:02,559
Come on, let's blow out those candles.

679
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:11,473
Look, I've made a little candle-snuffer.

680
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,550
THE END

681
01:07:35,305 --> 01:07:41,231
