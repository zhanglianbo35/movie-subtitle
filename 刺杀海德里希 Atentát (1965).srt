1
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,320
What's up Jacobi?

2
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,772
What does this mean?

3
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,240
As long as he is in Turkey, he is protected by von Pappen!

4
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:38,712
Today, he is passing through Prague.

5
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,200
He is on the way to Berlin; he will be there 9:10 PM at the main railway station.

6
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,000
Engage Görke for this!

7
00:04:49,563 --> 00:05:02,798
Main railway station Prague. Orient express from Istanbul, Sofia, Belgrade, Budapest, Vienna...

8
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,680
Colonel Horst?

9
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,480
Yes please?

10
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,344
Colonel Horst from Abwehr?

11
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,480
Guard! Come here!

12
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,000
Let it be, this is not for you.

13
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,920
Security service (Sicherheitsdienst).
Come with me.

14
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
I am not interested, mister...

15
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,880
Görke, Sturmbannführer Görke

16
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,640
You have no right.

17
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,800
My superior is Admirál Canaris.

18
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,040
My superior is SS Oberkommand Fuehrer Heydrich.

19
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Give me your gun and make no stupid moves.

20
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,480
Take care of the Colonel's luggage!

21
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,120
It's in the third compartment.
Shall we go?

22
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,080
I am expecting him... Come in!

23
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,360
Colonel Horst was arrested in Prague!

24
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,040
Poor Horst!

25
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,608
That's unbelievable!

26
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,908
Heydrich never dared anything like this before!

27
00:08:01,028 --> 00:08:02,255
Arresting our man!

28
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,285
Calm down and help yourself.

29
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,000
Good Turkish tobacco.

30
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,528
A gift from Horst, from our meeting in Switzerland.

31
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,600
How do you like it?

32
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,640
Excellent.

33
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,415
But Horst will never bring any more, Admiral!

34
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,160
Oh, this Heydrich!

35
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:32,200
He has no right to throw mud on the army.

36
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,400
Calm down, general.

37
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:38,160
Look, if Heydrich was sure

38
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,240
who is behind the trace from Istanbul to England,

39
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,200
he would not arrest the colonel,

40
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,480
he would bring Hitler a fatter chunk,

41
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,200
right! An Admiral.

42
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,040
He is not this far yet.

43
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,326
And never will be.

44
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:02,280
You will travel to Prague.

45
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,080
The fate of the Abwehr is in your hands.

46
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:10,000
Horst must not talk.

47
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,480
You will pay for his escape,

48
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,920
or death.

49
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,800
Heydrich is truly an unlucky guy.

50
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,920
Where ever he comes to make order,

51
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,400
they hate him.

52
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,800
In Germany, Norway, Netherlands--

53
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,600
and now in Prague.

54
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Because he is such an extraordinary executioner.

55
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,193
He is in Bohemia only two months
and he executes two thousand people.

56
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:39,640
Right!

57
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,240
He brought about such a personal hate for himself

58
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,760
in an occupied country,

59
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,680
it is, at the least, not cautious.

60
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,240
Not cautious.

61
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,080
And it's life threatening for him,

62
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
General.

63
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,160
Try it yourself, you moron!

64
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:42,516
Gentlemen, Flemming prepared a trap for me.

65
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,553
A Gestapo behind the tree, but I caught him.

66
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,055
You want to kill me too, you fool?

67
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,416
Look,

68
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,076
He got a hard time;

69
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:55,606
He needs to lose some weight and he will be our man.

70
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,666
I heard the command is interested in you.

71
00:12:57,786 --> 00:13:01,059
They need a piccolo for the marching band; will you take it?

72
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,458
My boys could have been orphans.

73
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,410
That Scottsman hit me really hard; If I were a hunchback, he would have straightened me up.

74
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,918
Well, not much damage. You're not a soldier anyhow.

75
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,442
You are thinking too much, intern.

76
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:25,014
Our old man in Hranice knew nothing that once we will have porridge for breakfast.

77
00:13:25,134 --> 00:13:27,795
That a Scot with bent legs will bash us in dirt.

78
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:29,527
He did not know about more things.

79
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:34,741
Like, what is the real war.

80
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:01,543
Bring me the cards of group "Silver A"

81
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:16,819
I brought the command from London.

82
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:24,629
With the better weather, the first paratroops will jump.

83
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:27,217
Group Silver A is ready.

84
00:15:27,337 --> 00:15:31,638
They have the Protektorat IDs in names Sedlak, Tolar a Tousek.

85
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:35,703
Give me the training reports of the whole group from the recent days.

86
00:15:41,116 --> 00:15:44,722
It is urgent. There will fly several groups one after another.

87
00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:46,344
Why this rush?

88
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:48,714
I don't know. But it's good for us.

89
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,730
The boys are nervous, the long waiting, nothing good in more waiting.

90
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,580
What tasks will they have at home?

91
00:15:53,905 --> 00:15:55,174
It varies.

92
00:15:55,294 --> 00:15:57,950
Contact the local resistance,

93
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,875
Radio communication with us,

94
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:01,339
Sabotage...

95
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:05,718
Have a look at this.

96
00:16:10,557 --> 00:16:11,917
Select two men.

97
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:15,254
They will be assigned a special task.

98
00:16:16,286 --> 00:16:19,867
They will fly without a radio, but be well armed.

99
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:24,423
Pistols, sting guns, bombs.

100
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:29,519
We need sharp, bright men, and prompt shooters.

101
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:33,883
They are named "Group Anthropoid."

102
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:35,436
They will fly with Silver A.

103
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:50,211
Soldiers,

104
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:55,345
You were chosen for the task, which is the ultimate goal of all your comrades in training.

105
00:16:56,404 --> 00:17:02,140
I assume you will be brave, loyal, and follow the commands.

106
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:05,991
Remember, you are making history.

107
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,455
Accomplish your tasks without hesitation,

108
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:11,719
even if you have to sacrifice your lives.

109
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:40,778
Fall out! Get in!

110
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:15,883
Are you OK?

111
00:24:16,003 --> 00:24:18,968
I am. I cannot find the freight parachute No. 2.

112
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:21,610
Joska did not show up yet?

113
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,623
Perhaps landed behind the forest. What about the radio?

114
00:24:23,743 --> 00:24:25,192
We will see. Where are we?

115
00:24:28,894 --> 00:24:31,667
A dog; there must be a village around.

116
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,105
Quite a nice barking, that dog.

117
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:38,177
God, we are at home.

118
00:24:38,665 --> 00:24:41,630
First, bury the parachutes and overalls, then look for Joska and No. 2,

119
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,008
We will meet here, all right?

120
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,273
Stop!

121
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,606
I have a bad day, Görke!

122
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,520
My pleasure, Obergruppenführer.

123
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,680
The revenge will be bitter!

124
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:46,904
What is that?

125
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,920
It was found in a forest near Podebrady.

126
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:51,834
- with a foreign weapon.

127
00:25:51,954 --> 00:25:54,200
Gauge 9 millimeter.
Stun gun, English make.

128
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,320
- Do you know anything about this?
- Not yet.

129
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,159
Again - nothing?

130
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,840
Nothing!
You never know anything!

131
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,000
What's up with you, Görke?

132
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,960
What about Oberst Horst,
did he finally start talking?

133
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:13,840
I had to interrupt the interrogation.
He has a weak heart.

134
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,880
What does it mean, weak heart?

135
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,560
I had to hand him over to doctor,
yesterday, after interrogation.

136
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,680
Remember,
a living colonel of Canaris

137
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,908
is 1000-times more valuable than you!
Jacobi speaking.

138
00:26:25,028 --> 00:26:28,400
Doctor, what is the status of Oberst Horst?

139
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,640
Thank you.

140
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,480
Colonel Horst is dead.

141
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,799
What a pig you are!
And you are not?

142
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Jacobi!

143
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:49,840
I will interrogate you myself.

144
00:26:50,785 --> 00:26:52,308
Hey!

145
00:26:52,914 --> 00:26:54,108
Anybody out there?

146
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:00,409
What are you doing here?

147
00:27:02,468 --> 00:27:06,036
Just looking. Surveying it here.

148
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:12,376
There should be a quarry re-opened here. Don't you know about it?

149
00:27:13,272 --> 00:27:16,237
The footprints are yours?

150
00:27:16,357 --> 00:27:17,533
Who are you?

151
00:27:18,162 --> 00:27:19,381
The gamekeeper.

152
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,345
This is my area.

153
00:27:22,445 --> 00:27:24,511
-Where is the second one?
-What second one?

154
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:26,346
There are two footprints.

155
00:27:28,464 --> 00:27:32,070
Sir, I found a parachute behind the cemetery.

156
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:34,701
It was not buried well.

157
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:40,156
I did not report anything. Don't worry.

158
00:27:47,841 --> 00:27:49,868
Do you want to help us?

159
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:53,122
Gentlemen,

160
00:27:53,392 --> 00:27:56,472
This is why I came.

161
00:28:00,484 --> 00:28:03,436
OK, we trust you.

162
00:28:05,966 --> 00:28:07,955
Did you fly in from England?

163
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:12,983
We have to get to Prague.

164
00:28:17,282 --> 00:28:18,668
I will arrange that.

165
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:39,033
Remove your hat.

166
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:41,316
- Why?
- You have to.

167
00:28:56,865 --> 00:28:59,397
Proceed further to the car, please.

168
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:11,791
Down on the street, our people are patrolling.

169
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,879
They are armed.

170
00:29:14,225 --> 00:29:18,011
- Nobody gets out of the house, in case you would be not...
- What?

171
00:29:19,562 --> 00:29:21,500
Real paratroopers?

172
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:26,327
Good evening!

173
00:29:34,544 --> 00:29:35,648
Excuse me.

174
00:29:37,252 --> 00:29:39,408
This is Zdenek, I am Ota.

175
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,388
I also have my customs, if you allow.

176
00:29:48,004 --> 00:29:52,226
Ota Radovec, you saw his wife, and this is Vita, the son.

177
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:57,437
I am Ondra, last name Havelka if you wish.

178
00:30:01,606 --> 00:30:04,237
- Why did they send you here?
- It's our business.

179
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,741
Well, not really anymore.

180
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,417
We cannot disclose our task yet.

181
00:30:14,406 --> 00:30:17,037
We are the soldiers.

182
00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:20,288
And who are you?

183
00:30:23,035 --> 00:30:25,666
It is just a coincidence you got here.

184
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:29,580
We have nothing about other groups.

185
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:32,395
What do you need from us?

186
00:30:32,985 --> 00:30:34,384
Accommodations in Prague.

187
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,197
Zdenek broke his toe when landing; he needs to treat it.

188
00:30:40,231 --> 00:30:41,502
You will stay here.

189
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,146
My wife is a Red Cross nurse.

190
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:48,650
We will get the food stamps for you; you cannot exist here without them.

191
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:52,405
And they will also need work permits, right?

192
00:30:52,897 --> 00:30:57,697
- You have to get accustomed to the new German order.
- We will send it to hell.

193
00:30:58,104 --> 00:31:01,287
They arrested and executed lots of people.

194
00:31:02,572 --> 00:31:07,924
For less than harboring the paratroopers, but you must know it in England.

195
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,918
A collection of wool and fur items for the German soldiers in the East.

196
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:32,119
This collection proved how tight is the bond of the Motherland with the front line.

197
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:36,560
From the first days, the results exceeded the expectations in the town and country.

198
00:31:46,297 --> 00:31:49,005
German troops at Leningrad.

199
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:56,231
German artillery shooting at the fortresses of Soviet field fortification.

200
00:31:56,351 --> 00:32:00,225
The assault troops of Waffen SS preparing for the attack.

201
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:12,103
It seems that the crew of the fortress is fully exterminated.

202
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:23,568
Ice cream! Thank you! Who else please?

203
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:35,467
That's him.

204
00:32:39,253 --> 00:32:42,154
If you get over there to the closet, I will have you always in sight.

205
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:01,337
- Vasek.
- Sedlak.

206
00:33:02,826 --> 00:33:04,995
Do you know Cpt. Holz in England?

207
00:33:08,515 --> 00:33:09,914
I do.

208
00:33:11,171 --> 00:33:14,354
He is about 40, tall,

209
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,650
He is from Moravia, Hodonin - I think.

210
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:22,271
Dark hair, lots of gray hair by now.

211
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:24,106
That is right.

212
00:33:26,949 --> 00:33:28,322
Come in.

213
00:33:39,088 --> 00:33:41,654
Do you have the radio connection with London?

214
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,492
The radio is not working yet.

215
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,268
We will help you with the repair,

216
00:33:49,388 --> 00:33:52,792
and you will request the bombing of SKODA factory, ok?

217
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:52,006
We will help you with the repair and you will request the bombing of SKODA factory, ok?

218
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,757
Only afterwards, we find our comrade who jumped with us.

219
00:33:58,144 --> 00:34:01,058
- We don't know about him yet.
- We will get you together,

220
00:34:01,178 --> 00:34:03,260
If he is not in Gestapo's hands.

221
00:34:05,362 --> 00:34:07,569
I don't know about your task

222
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:10,162
but don't do anything without us.

223
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,690
You are lost alone.

224
00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:21,247
- Joska, Jirka has got London.
- Great!

225
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:37,972
They will call us shortly.

226
00:34:39,593 --> 00:34:42,339
- So what?
- I will now see deep into your privacy.

227
00:34:43,212 --> 00:34:45,676
I have the first question for you from London.

228
00:34:46,155 --> 00:34:48,119
Report your position.

229
00:34:52,302 --> 00:34:53,766
Respond.

230
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,794
We landed in the area of Podebrady,

231
00:34:56,914 --> 00:35:00,171
Material and group are OK,

232
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:02,712
Station located provisionally.

233
00:35:03,482 --> 00:35:05,895
Bures and Kotrc arrested in Chrudim.

234
00:35:07,123 --> 00:35:08,958
Send the new addresses.

235
00:35:09,078 --> 00:35:12,500
The domestic resistance demands bombing of SKODA factory in Pilsen.

236
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,312
Considered top priority for the domestic situation. End.

237
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:25,072
Hand this over to London. Let them decide how they want.

238
00:35:25,547 --> 00:35:27,318
SKODA is not mine.

239
00:35:31,403 --> 00:35:33,431
Anthropoid still silent.

240
00:35:36,293 --> 00:35:38,141
Are the boys in Prague at all?

241
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:44,840
Prepare the next group. Three people.

242
00:35:45,238 --> 00:35:47,445
Operational area Prague.

243
00:35:50,864 --> 00:35:52,802
Gentlemen, will you board.

244
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:08,727
Oh God, they really mean it.

245
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,381
A beautiful cathedral.

246
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:56,017
I forgot the name of its saint.

247
00:36:56,484 --> 00:36:58,987
Saint Vitus, please.

248
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,058
Where are we going at all?

249
00:37:04,192 --> 00:37:07,796
I want to show you something.

250
00:37:07,963 --> 00:37:09,264
A secret?
- Almost.

251
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:11,967
Maybe a gravestone of Oberst Horst?

252
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:15,617
So what did you want to show me at all?

253
00:37:15,737 --> 00:37:18,773
Czech coronation jewels, Admiral.

254
00:37:59,514 --> 00:38:01,883
Look at this...this great sapphire.

255
00:38:03,878 --> 00:38:06,247
It is uncut, 40 carats.

256
00:38:06,714 --> 00:38:10,385
You are an expert, General.
You know the value of the things.

257
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:12,287
And people, too, Admiral.

258
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:13,755
Great.

259
00:38:14,756 --> 00:38:15,857
A local tale says,

260
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:19,594
he who puts this crown on his head illegitimately,
dies within a year.

261
00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:22,197
Are you superstitious?

262
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:47,755
Did you like it, Admiral?

263
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:51,025
Beautiful!

264
00:38:51,259 --> 00:38:54,963
And how do you like your task,
assigned by Fuehrer?

265
00:38:55,563 --> 00:38:56,664
I consent.

266
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,101
My Abwehr and your
Reichssicherheitshauptamt,

267
00:39:00,335 --> 00:39:04,072
make up together
unbelievable power!

268
00:39:05,073 --> 00:39:06,374
It depends only,

269
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:09,277
who will lead it.

270
00:39:09,711 --> 00:39:11,546
The Fuehrer will decide.

271
00:39:11,913 --> 00:39:13,982
The details remain open.

272
00:39:14,182 --> 00:39:17,252
Do you count the case of
Oberst Horst there?

273
00:39:19,654 --> 00:39:22,123
It was a painful mistake
of my officer.

274
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:24,692
But it cost Horst his life.

275
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,929
Providence fixed the mistake.

276
00:39:28,229 --> 00:39:31,199
The interrogator died
in a car accident.

277
00:39:32,493 --> 00:39:37,539
Poor Görke.
He valued so much the cloth he used to wear.

278
00:39:38,907 --> 00:39:40,141
You knew even this?

279
00:39:40,308 --> 00:39:42,577
In our work there are many things

280
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:46,147
which we must keep on mind,
General.

281
00:39:47,715 --> 00:39:51,419
Can I announce to the Fuehrer
that we made a deal?

282
00:39:52,629 --> 00:39:53,771
General,

283
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:58,960
You know that the Fuehrer's wish
is my command.

284
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,095
It was always clear to me.

285
00:40:01,262 --> 00:40:03,865
I think it will be best
if we prepare the draft

286
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:06,734
and bring it to the Fuehrer personally.

287
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:10,471
Together, agree?

288
00:40:10,572 --> 00:40:12,040
Definitely.

289
00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:47,643
I got a great company. One lost on jump and the other lost his nerve.

290
00:40:47,763 --> 00:40:51,651
Not that bad, but it does not work so well for me here at home.

291
00:40:51,771 --> 00:40:53,807
I found my girl,

292
00:40:53,927 --> 00:40:58,183
She had a child born in 1939, right when I got to Poland.

293
00:40:58,303 --> 00:41:00,866
They are in Kolin.
- How do you know? Were you there?

294
00:41:00,986 --> 00:41:06,016
I was not. I would need few days break.

295
00:41:13,707 --> 00:41:15,516
You are a funk anyhow.

296
00:41:36,558 --> 00:41:37,739
What a fireworks!

297
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:41,066
But they drop it far away. Don't you need the fires, damned?

298
00:41:47,812 --> 00:41:50,161
- Where are they dropping it?
- Somewhere in the fields.

299
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:53,947
Far away from the factory.

300
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:59,516
Bullshit, the visibility was quite good.

301
00:42:59,636 --> 00:43:03,289
I know what the real bombing looks like

302
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:04,906
and you too, anyhow.

303
00:43:05,026 --> 00:43:06,908
We saw it together in France.

304
00:43:07,028 --> 00:43:11,444
Maybe you're right. Maybe it's a too high politics for us.

305
00:43:11,564 --> 00:43:15,385
- I don't care for such politics.
- Don't shout on me, neither do I.

306
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:19,906
I wonder why we care, our job here is different.

307
00:43:20,715 --> 00:43:22,422
What do you mean?

308
00:43:23,256 --> 00:43:24,552
Assassination of Heydrich.

309
00:43:39,254 --> 00:43:41,218
Man, there must be plenty of pheasants here.

310
00:43:42,043 --> 00:43:45,149
There is one right there. Ready to get shot.

311
00:44:00,378 --> 00:44:04,228
- Are you holding the handle bars tight?
- So far I do.

312
00:44:29,797 --> 00:44:37,357
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10.

313
00:44:38,733 --> 00:44:40,863
Don't be fool, Joska.

314
00:44:41,518 --> 00:44:44,804
I thought we would need a 12-15 meters of steel rope...

315
00:44:44,924 --> 00:44:47,101
...when Heydrich coming
- I say it's nonsense.

316
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:48,936
Sit down and don't show up too much.

317
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:53,284
Look around; not a hare would hide in these fields; what would be next?

318
00:44:53,404 --> 00:44:55,132
Only a fool like you.

319
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:00,523
Eat, play nice, and don't disturb when the adults are talking.

320
00:45:04,417 --> 00:45:06,343
He's coming.

321
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:42,005
Here.

322
00:45:43,477 --> 00:45:45,385
Or not?

323
00:45:45,505 --> 00:45:47,952
You know Prague better than we do.

324
00:45:48,072 --> 00:45:51,511
It's a good place; you won't find a better one. But...

325
00:45:52,371 --> 00:45:53,911
What if he's coming with the escort?

326
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:57,068
He is driving alone already one week.

327
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,780
We have an exact action plan.

328
00:45:59,653 --> 00:46:01,321
Zdenek with the automatic gun here.

329
00:46:01,822 --> 00:46:03,567
Ota as a back-up with bombs here.

330
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:05,488
Joska here.

331
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:08,478
He will give a sign with the mirror when Heydrich will be coming

332
00:46:08,598 --> 00:46:10,262
And cover our back.

333
00:46:10,751 --> 00:46:15,449
You and I, we will patrol the surrounding streets.

334
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:18,973
What do you think?

335
00:46:24,236 --> 00:46:25,674
Don't you like something?

336
00:46:25,918 --> 00:46:27,907
You know what will follow the assassination.

337
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,230
Our prestige in the world will rise.

338
00:46:30,615 --> 00:46:31,642
What is that?

339
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:34,606
They will seek revenge for this.

340
00:46:35,177 --> 00:46:37,744
Arrest. Execute.

341
00:46:39,156 --> 00:46:41,857
Did you think about it?

342
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:48,445
I did.

343
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:51,489
But this is the war and we are fighting.

344
00:46:52,362 --> 00:46:54,223
We have no right to retreat.

345
00:46:55,794 --> 00:46:57,064
It's not my way.

346
00:46:59,759 --> 00:47:01,056
I cannot command you.

347
00:47:02,545 --> 00:47:04,008
But I ask you for one.

348
00:47:04,585 --> 00:47:06,356
Keep this secret.

349
00:47:08,823 --> 00:47:10,774
- There is one more option.
- What is it?

350
00:47:12,737 --> 00:47:16,254
If London will recall the assassination; will you obey?

351
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:20,732
I am the soldier.

352
00:47:21,826 --> 00:47:23,905
I will obey every command.

353
00:47:26,113 --> 00:47:28,075
No questions.

354
00:47:33,691 --> 00:47:35,847
- They are here.
- Don't transmit right now, wait.

355
00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:43,407
Read the message once more.

356
00:47:46,256 --> 00:47:50,828
The central command of the local resistance requests delivering the following message:

357
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:56,218
Assassination of Heydrich would not help the allies

358
00:47:56,338 --> 00:47:58,490
and would have immense consequences for our nation.

359
00:47:58,782 --> 00:48:01,131
It would open the nation to enormous reprisal

360
00:48:01,251 --> 00:48:05,712
and destroy the last remnants of any organization.

361
00:48:06,732 --> 00:48:09,491
Therefore, we ask for a command

362
00:48:09,611 --> 00:48:12,174
to recall the assassination.

363
00:48:12,597 --> 00:48:15,459
Very urgent; issue the command immediately.

364
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,827
Correct?

365
00:48:18,575 --> 00:48:20,680
Correct; send it.

366
00:48:45,787 --> 00:48:48,675
Then you have a light, please?

367
00:49:22,276 --> 00:49:23,678
Something else, Jacobi?

368
00:49:24,112 --> 00:49:26,414
Your signature on seventeen
death sentences.

369
00:49:26,614 --> 00:49:28,316
It must be sorted out
before you leave.

370
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:30,318
Only seventeen?

371
00:49:30,518 --> 00:49:33,581
Seventeen.
You revoked the martial law.

372
00:49:36,457 --> 00:49:38,226
What is the schedule?

373
00:49:39,861 --> 00:49:41,943
The driver is waiting in the car.

374
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:43,831
11:30 your aircraft is departing.

375
00:49:44,932 --> 00:49:47,068
1:25 PM you are in Fuehrer's headquarters.

376
00:49:48,102 --> 00:49:49,704
He is expecting you 5 PM.

377
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:54,409
You have the paperwork
in your bag.

378
00:49:58,046 --> 00:49:59,414
Yes?

379
00:49:59,614 --> 00:50:01,416
Berlín.
Assistant of Admiral Canaris.

380
00:50:03,351 --> 00:50:05,782
Standartenführer Jacobi.

381
00:50:07,455 --> 00:50:10,491
Yes...Thank you.

382
00:50:12,794 --> 00:50:16,197
The Admiral will be with the Fuehrer 4PM.

383
00:50:17,131 --> 00:50:20,134
He is pleased that by chance,
he has some more dealings with him.

384
00:50:20,401 --> 00:50:21,803
How nice from the Admiral.

385
00:50:22,203 --> 00:50:24,605
I can ensure you, Jacobi,
this was his last trick!

386
00:50:24,806 --> 00:50:29,377
Not him, I will say to Fuehrer:
Either Canaris, or Heydrich.

387
00:50:29,744 --> 00:50:32,113
One moment please.

388
00:50:32,513 --> 00:50:35,450
Things came so far,

389
00:50:35,817 --> 00:50:38,619
that I will hand you over
the statement of the dead man.

390
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,622
You may find a use for it.

391
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:45,660
I worked hard on it
last few days.

392
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:50,698
The advantage is that Oberst Horst
will never revoke this statement.

393
00:50:51,866 --> 00:50:54,268
I will call you
right after the meeting.

394
00:53:30,224 --> 00:53:32,229
Shit!

395
00:53:37,171 --> 00:53:42,259
Today, May 27, around 10:30 AM,

396
00:53:42,379 --> 00:53:44,585
An assassination was committed

397
00:53:44,705 --> 00:53:48,716
On the deputy Reich protector and the police general

398
00:53:48,836 --> 00:53:52,706
SS Obergruppenfuhrer Reinhard Heydrich.

399
00:53:53,128 --> 00:54:00,628
The deputy protector was driving from Brezany to Liben.

400
00:54:00,748 --> 00:54:04,383
He was going to turn into V Holesovickach Street.

401
00:54:04,503 --> 00:54:07,531
Here a man stood in front of the vehicle

402
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:13,166
and attempted the shoot from an automatic pistol at the persons in the car.

403
00:54:13,286 --> 00:54:16,796
Simultaneously, another man threw a grenade,

404
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:19,198
Which exploded at contact.

405
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:25,093
After the assassination, one perpetrator ran to V Holesovickach Street,

406
00:54:25,213 --> 00:54:27,700
probably towards the city.

407
00:54:28,373 --> 00:54:34,906
The second perpetrator escaped on a bicycle towards Old Liben.

408
00:54:35,446 --> 00:54:38,876
He was a man of average height,

409
00:54:38,996 --> 00:54:42,662
Dark grey suit, dark hat.

410
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:47,475
The other perpetrator wore dark brown suit,

411
00:54:47,595 --> 00:54:49,297
and brown shoes.

412
00:54:49,836 --> 00:54:55,252
The reward for capturing the perpetrators is 10 mil. Crown

413
00:54:55,372 --> 00:54:58,999
to be awarded to a member of the public

414
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:02,157
that provides the information leading to the arrest.

415
00:55:02,785 --> 00:55:09,009
(the sound of Czech radio from London)

416
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:35,780
Based on Article 1 of Emergency State declared Sept. 27, 1941,

417
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:41,615
Martial Law is pronounced, effective immediately

418
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:45,055
in the area of the whole Protektorat Bohemia and Moravia.

419
00:55:46,275 --> 00:55:51,113
Based on Article 2 of the law referenced above, I dictate that

420
00:55:52,114 --> 00:55:58,311
any person harboring perpetrators who took part in the assassination,

421
00:55:58,568 --> 00:56:00,390
providing them support,

422
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:04,651
or having knowledge about their identity or whereabouts,

423
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:07,231
and does not inform the authorities,

424
00:56:07,662 --> 00:56:11,537
will be shot dead, including the whole family.

425
00:56:12,012 --> 00:56:18,494
- Signed, the ...and police to Reich Protector, K.H. Frank.
- Close it.

426
00:56:37,075 --> 00:56:38,538
Why are you looking at me?

427
00:56:39,285 --> 00:56:42,665
What are you looking at? it's not my fault it did not work out!

428
00:56:42,785 --> 00:56:45,201
We got him, that is what's important.

429
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:50,779
- Ota got him; I was useless.
- Zdenek!

430
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:25,893
Does it hurt?

431
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:28,319
- What do you think, did he turn up toes?
- Just sleep.

432
00:57:29,333 --> 00:57:30,822
If he only went off.

433
00:57:31,463 --> 00:57:33,209
They won't say anything, bastards.

434
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:35,474
He is not happy, you can be sure.

435
00:57:36,064 --> 00:57:39,722
- You did all right, just sleep.\
- Why don't you sleep?

436
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:41,955
Are you sleeping?

437
00:57:44,185 --> 00:57:45,315
Where is Karel?

438
00:58:18,551 --> 00:58:20,386
- Mom!
- Jesus Christ!

439
00:59:03,937 --> 00:59:07,006
- The cause of death?
- I read the report of Professor Hamperl.

440
00:59:07,407 --> 00:59:08,775
Some sepsis in spleen.

441
00:59:09,642 --> 00:59:12,478
He got some infection
with the shrapnel.

442
00:59:14,647 --> 00:59:16,849
May he rest in peace.

443
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:19,953
He was a great man.

444
00:59:20,587 --> 00:59:23,323
Please write the suitable
condolence letters.

445
00:59:23,723 --> 00:59:27,260
To Fuehrer, Himmler,
Bormann, etc...

446
00:59:28,561 --> 00:59:31,030
Sit down please!

447
00:59:31,197 --> 00:59:33,199
I see that the sadness is exhausting you.

448
00:59:33,633 --> 00:59:35,301
What does it look like at the funeral?

449
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:37,871
Three days from now,
from the Reich chancellor's office.

450
00:59:38,238 --> 00:59:40,740
Himmler left for Prague; meanwhile,

451
00:59:40,874 --> 00:59:43,743
They want to enjoy
some post-mortem fame there, too.

452
00:59:43,843 --> 00:59:46,713
Frank does what he can
to preserve the position of protector.

453
00:59:47,113 --> 00:59:48,681
He has not the slightest chance.

454
00:59:49,082 --> 00:59:50,597
The Fuehrer does not like him.

455
00:59:50,717 --> 00:59:52,418
The book seller from Carlsbad

456
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:54,520
is only good for dirty jobs.

457
00:59:54,721 --> 00:59:58,605
His brutal measures after the assassination
only hardened the nation.

458
00:59:59,893 --> 01:00:02,896
I don't think they will produce the assassin.

459
01:00:03,997 --> 01:00:06,799
A sad event.

460
01:00:07,433 --> 01:00:10,203
One graphologist told me
when I showed him

461
01:00:10,837 --> 01:00:12,872
Heydrich's hand writing:

462
01:00:13,006 --> 01:00:18,278
This is the hand writing of a
fanatic and dangerous man.

463
01:00:19,012 --> 01:00:21,247
He will not restrain from anything.

464
01:00:21,347 --> 01:00:23,683
He is a mastermind villain.

465
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:27,554
History is relentless,

466
01:00:28,555 --> 01:00:32,992
but history also needs a hand who knows how to steer it.

467
01:00:34,294 --> 01:00:37,363
The Prodigy has
repaired an error.

468
01:00:38,364 --> 01:00:40,967
Let it serve to Czech's fame

469
01:00:41,834 --> 01:00:47,173
and our profit, General.

470
01:02:09,455 --> 01:02:13,693
All exits from the city
are tightly closed.

471
01:02:13,893 --> 01:02:19,365
Nobody leaves or enters Prague
without our knowledge.

472
01:02:19,832 --> 01:02:24,237
We will search neighborhood by neighborhood,
house by house.

473
01:02:24,837 --> 01:02:26,906
Each person will pass
our checkpoint.

474
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:30,877
And you believe we will catch the felon
with the checkpoints?

475
01:02:32,745 --> 01:02:35,348
You have no idea about this place
and its population!

476
01:02:36,049 --> 01:02:39,052
Take off the uniform
and walk the streets.

477
01:02:43,389 --> 01:02:45,925
You will get the goosebumps!

478
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,364
The fallen comrade Heydrich
could not realize his plan:

479
01:02:51,798 --> 01:02:56,502
To liquidate the best people
of this nation,

480
01:02:57,103 --> 01:03:02,075
to move away or re-educate the rest,

481
01:03:02,942 --> 01:03:08,848
and ultimately wipe the Czech nation
from the map of Europe.

482
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:14,520
Both Staatssekretar Frank
and I believe

483
01:03:14,721 --> 01:03:19,814
that this Czech pack
must be exterminated without exceptions.

484
01:03:21,162 --> 01:03:22,715
Executions...

485
01:03:23,931 --> 01:03:25,395
Hundreds...

486
01:03:26,717 --> 01:03:28,193
Thousands...

487
01:03:28,535 --> 01:03:31,604
That's the only way
to revenge Reinhard Heydrich

488
01:03:33,923 --> 01:03:38,613
and destroy his killers,
wherever they hide.

489
01:04:11,291 --> 01:04:12,844
Forty-eight

490
01:04:13,589 --> 01:04:15,514
Forty-eight again.

491
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:45,076
What's up? Where are you going?

492
01:04:45,196 --> 01:04:46,719
Forty-eight again.

493
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,226
Go lie down.

494
01:05:00,612 --> 01:05:02,729
- Send here Sedlacek.
- Not down there.

495
01:05:03,956 --> 01:05:05,239
At least it's warm here.

496
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,908
I don't need a patient, I need a patrol.

497
01:05:13,873 --> 01:05:15,681
Go.

498
01:05:54,816 --> 01:05:56,369
Sedlacek, go up there.

499
01:05:57,357 --> 01:06:01,220
What's the rush Josko, you have an hour.

500
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:19,040
Oh God, what this one looks like.

501
01:06:25,419 --> 01:06:27,665
Oh man, you have the fever like a baby.

502
01:06:27,785 --> 01:06:30,084
You need the bed and sweat.

503
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:35,012
- In this ice cave, it is just to...
- To die, just tell it.

504
01:06:36,355 --> 01:06:39,153
I will make you a nice fake tea, I still know how.

505
01:06:39,273 --> 01:06:41,003
The hospital is just behind the corner.

506
01:06:41,123 --> 01:06:44,044
Ota will get a nurse for you and you can stay here;

507
01:06:44,164 --> 01:06:46,986
- we will go to the cinema. That might help you.
- Don't babble and give me some water.

508
01:06:47,106 --> 01:06:50,825
If it did not work out for you, you have everything you need here.

509
01:06:50,945 --> 01:06:52,404
The priest is up there.

510
01:06:52,524 --> 01:06:56,073
Stupid jokes. He is not interested.

511
01:06:56,727 --> 01:06:58,935
A sip of rum or plum brandy.

512
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:01,155
That would help him get on his feet.

513
01:07:13,857 --> 01:07:17,527
So what? White or black?

514
01:07:18,528 --> 01:07:19,876
Whatever. Black.

515
01:07:20,928 --> 01:07:22,135
It does not matter.

516
01:07:23,388 --> 01:07:25,236
White or black.

517
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:45,379
Where are the boys?

518
01:07:46,611 --> 01:07:48,254
Do you hear me? Where are the boys?

519
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,600
Your commander is sending you a message
that you must not stay here at home.

520
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,312
Gestapo is tracking all families with someone abroad.

521
01:07:57,378 --> 01:07:59,123
Gestapo is tracking...

522
01:07:59,829 --> 01:08:01,100
Where should I go?

523
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:04,193
In martial law, you did not get any advice from the dear lieutenant, right?

524
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:06,584
I will take you to join them.

525
01:08:07,499 --> 01:08:09,251
But where?

526
01:08:09,848 --> 01:08:11,608
Where are they?

527
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:13,865
A place.

528
01:08:15,238 --> 01:08:16,239
In Prague.

529
01:08:17,407 --> 01:08:18,523
Vitka...

530
01:08:19,871 --> 01:08:22,053
- You don't trust me, do you?
- I do!

531
01:08:22,823 --> 01:08:25,646
But Kral said nobody can be at home or in any apartments.

532
01:08:25,766 --> 01:08:28,515
There are searches everywhere; they were in our home too.
But we hid them elsewhere.

533
01:08:28,635 --> 01:08:31,788
These three paratroopers, who landed in April near Krivoklat, too.

534
01:08:32,429 --> 01:08:34,444
They are all well hidden.

535
01:08:34,906 --> 01:08:36,716
We bring them food with mom.

536
01:08:37,027 --> 01:08:38,580
But where, hell?

537
01:08:47,288 --> 01:08:48,327
Vitka!

538
01:08:49,803 --> 01:08:51,433
You became a soldier.

539
01:08:53,615 --> 01:08:57,414
But I am frightened.

540
01:09:01,315 --> 01:09:02,701
Will you go with me to Prague?

541
01:09:04,356 --> 01:09:06,117
To join them?

542
01:09:08,618 --> 01:09:10,748
What should I say to the commander?

543
01:09:11,878 --> 01:09:14,638
Go, Vitka, return home.

544
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:17,425
People must not see you here.

545
01:09:19,414 --> 01:09:20,736
Greetings to the boys.

546
01:09:22,841 --> 01:09:24,188
Tell to the commander,

547
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:27,296
I know what to do.

548
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,365
Attention.

549
01:09:41,485 --> 01:09:44,176
Special news.

550
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:50,074
During the search of assassins of Obergruppenfuehrer R. Heydrich,

551
01:09:50,541 --> 01:09:53,339
There was found that, with no doubts,

552
01:09:53,459 --> 01:09:56,740
the citizens of the village of Lidice

553
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,281
provided the support and help

554
01:09:59,401 --> 01:10:03,333
To the identified perpetrators group.

555
01:10:03,453 --> 01:10:08,300
Evidence was found without help from the local population

556
01:10:08,858 --> 01:10:11,643
although they were questioned.

557
01:10:13,104 --> 01:10:20,076
By supporting the murderers of Obergruppenfuehrer Heydrich,

558
01:10:20,196 --> 01:10:23,425
they trespassed the law in the profoundest manner.

559
01:10:24,234 --> 01:10:26,814
All adult men were shot dead,

560
01:10:26,934 --> 01:10:30,236
women were transported to concentration camps,

561
01:10:30,647 --> 01:10:34,087
and children were handed over for re-education.

562
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:39,041
The buildings in the village were razed to the ground

563
01:10:39,161 --> 01:10:42,687
and the name of the village was erased.

564
01:10:44,341 --> 01:10:45,727
That is impossible.

565
01:10:51,015 --> 01:10:53,518
It is not their fault!

566
01:10:54,121 --> 01:10:55,802
Bring me the ladder!

567
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:01,536
Did you hear me? Ladder!

568
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:12,800
Are we still soldiers or not?

569
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,597
Closer to "not", if you don't see!

570
01:11:14,717 --> 01:11:16,368
How are you talking with me?

571
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:35,209
We have to stand it, boys.

572
01:11:36,672 --> 01:11:40,638
When it gets quieter here, they will send us an aircraft from England.

573
01:11:41,417 --> 01:11:45,267
Nobody gets out of this tomb alive, you know it!

574
01:11:58,807 --> 01:12:00,437
Lieutenant,

575
01:12:01,863 --> 01:12:08,100
I killed Heydrich. I cannot hide when Germans shoot innocent people.

576
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:11,001
- What do you want to do?
- Go outside.

577
01:12:12,618 --> 01:12:15,836
I will write who I am and what I did.

578
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,505
I will sit down in the park and...

579
01:12:20,456 --> 01:12:22,702
Don't worry, they won't get me alive.

580
01:12:24,306 --> 01:12:26,096
I will go too (talking in Slovak).

581
01:12:31,893 --> 01:12:33,420
I cannot let you go.

582
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:37,275
We have only executed the order.

583
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:47,332
Our conscience is clear.

584
01:13:25,191 --> 01:13:35,332
Reward 10 mil. Czech Koruna for information on Heydrich's assasionation

585
01:14:12,697 --> 01:14:14,878
They are expecting you behind the altar.

586
01:14:29,217 --> 01:14:32,350
What are you looking at? You don't like me, right?

587
01:14:33,839 --> 01:14:36,947
It's not too genteel here. We play no poker or billiards.

588
01:14:38,501 --> 01:14:40,206
Do you have something for us?

589
01:14:40,326 --> 01:14:42,938
A message from London.

590
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:46,874
Mr. [Czech] President [Benes] expresses his appreciation.

591
01:14:51,336 --> 01:14:52,940
Thanks.

592
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:55,273
I will convey the message to the boys.

593
01:14:56,085 --> 01:14:58,934
What about the aircraft?

594
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:00,949
When are they sending for us?

595
01:15:04,607 --> 01:15:09,356
- They say June has short nights.
- Short nights; Every moron knows that!

596
01:15:17,832 --> 01:15:23,518
So, we found the right address for us anyhow.

597
01:15:24,788 --> 01:15:26,301
Right?

598
01:15:31,288 --> 01:15:32,597
We will get you out of here.

599
01:15:33,572 --> 01:15:35,408
Vasek is fishing for a funeral car.

600
01:15:36,794 --> 01:15:39,296
We will load you into coffins and drive out of Prague.

601
01:15:39,416 --> 01:15:42,538
And is the funeral home confident?

602
01:15:52,433 --> 01:15:53,975
Well..

603
01:15:56,411 --> 01:15:58,195
So when will they come?

604
01:16:55,699 --> 01:16:57,368
Just come in, young man.

605
01:16:57,488 --> 01:17:00,076
Did you hear that, urchin?

606
01:17:06,284 --> 01:17:07,907
The second one is coming!
- Go, open the door.

607
01:17:08,027 --> 01:17:09,785
Where is mom?

608
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,252
Sorry, it might be a mistake, I am - next door.

609
01:17:36,372 --> 01:17:38,203
No mistake, we are waiting for you.

610
01:17:38,924 --> 01:17:42,525
Don't come in!

611
01:17:42,645 --> 01:17:44,668
Bastards!

612
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:51,640
No! No!

613
01:18:07,597 --> 01:18:10,233
- Where are they (German accent)
- I don't know.

614
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:22,515
You. Ask him where they are.

615
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:26,525
Vitka...

616
01:18:26,645 --> 01:18:28,322
Where are the boys?

617
01:18:28,656 --> 01:18:29,849
I don't know.

618
01:18:30,889 --> 01:18:31,967
Where are they?

619
01:18:33,687 --> 01:18:34,624
Where are they?

620
01:18:35,814 --> 01:18:37,316
Please, Vitka.

621
01:18:37,932 --> 01:18:40,037
Where are they?

622
01:18:40,157 --> 01:18:43,143
Where are they?

623
01:19:26,538 --> 01:19:31,146
Wake up. Germans are here.

624
01:19:36,344 --> 01:19:37,653
Wake up!

625
01:19:56,862 --> 01:19:59,113
Get down there and wake up everyone.

626
01:19:59,493 --> 01:20:00,738
Give them my greetings.

627
01:20:03,266 --> 01:20:04,960
Shoot only when you are sure.

628
01:20:05,268 --> 01:20:06,526
And come back.

629
01:20:06,839 --> 01:20:09,188
They must not get anyone alive. Wait!

630
01:20:10,471 --> 01:20:11,742
Last round.

631
01:20:12,884 --> 01:20:13,975
For yourself.

632
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:58,673
Remember, Jozka. The last shot is for you.

633
01:20:58,793 --> 01:21:01,519
It's not fitting well into my schedule today, but I will do my best.

634
01:21:02,766 --> 01:21:04,756
What are you waiting for? Clear off!

635
01:22:59,754 --> 01:23:01,627
Barricade the stairway!

636
01:23:28,491 --> 01:23:31,070
They will be back here in a while.

637
01:23:32,623 --> 01:23:35,267
Shouldn't they have come for us today?

638
01:23:36,897 --> 01:23:38,784
It does not matter anymore.

639
01:23:45,352 --> 01:23:49,022
Carrying seven coffins...

640
01:23:49,543 --> 01:23:51,622
That is a great business.

641
01:27:28,799 --> 01:27:30,506
What's up with you?

642
01:27:33,073 --> 01:27:34,215
Nothing.

643
01:27:36,461 --> 01:27:37,706
I am fine.

644
01:29:02,085 --> 01:29:03,342
Stop it!

645
01:29:03,958 --> 01:29:05,139
Stop it!

646
01:29:06,579 --> 01:29:07,709
Do you hear that?

647
01:29:14,216 --> 01:29:15,319
Silence.

648
01:29:27,752 --> 01:29:30,293
Guys! Give up!

649
01:29:32,103 --> 01:29:33,630
Nothing will happen to you.

650
01:29:35,157 --> 01:29:37,121
I am OK, too.

651
01:29:37,609 --> 01:29:40,505
Give up, boys!

652
01:29:41,096 --> 01:29:42,109
It's Karel.

653
01:29:43,342 --> 01:29:45,883
He betrayed us.

654
01:29:46,003 --> 01:29:47,615
You rat!

655
01:30:25,383 --> 01:30:28,286
Stop the fire immediately!
The Fuehrer wants them alive!

656
01:30:28,553 --> 01:30:29,587
Yes sir!

657
01:30:42,745 --> 01:30:48,393
I have a feeling that it's all gone down the drain.

658
01:30:51,424 --> 01:30:54,318
Imagine, we are now the most expensive people in the world.

659
01:30:55,306 --> 01:30:56,808
There is a 10 mil Crown reward for us.

660
01:31:06,251 --> 01:31:07,727
You have the fever again.

661
01:31:08,856 --> 01:31:11,825
I won't make you a tea; you would not have time to drink it anymore.

662
01:31:18,446 --> 01:31:20,217
He sold us.

663
01:31:22,682 --> 01:31:24,209
He sold us like a Judas.

664
01:31:29,432 --> 01:31:32,128
So what, black?

665
01:31:32,397 --> 01:31:34,007
Or white?

666
01:31:35,218 --> 01:31:37,913
Man, you need the warmth!

667
01:31:38,427 --> 01:31:42,007
Leave me alone; it does not matter anymore!

668
01:33:20,657 --> 01:33:22,965
Stop!
Stop!

669
01:33:25,462 --> 01:33:26,596
The street is closed.

670
01:33:27,364 --> 01:33:30,834
Go back!

671
01:34:02,466 --> 01:34:04,568
Get the explosive here!

672
01:34:38,086 --> 01:34:39,973
What are we waiting for?

673
01:35:43,185 --> 01:35:46,509
We ask you to give up!

674
01:35:46,629 --> 01:35:49,499
Give up and nothing will happen to you!

675
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:51,489
Give up!

676
01:36:21,403 --> 01:36:22,571
How many?

677
01:36:24,967 --> 01:36:26,572
Just one.

678
01:36:27,444 --> 01:36:28,882
The last.

679
01:36:47,678 --> 01:36:50,758
Give up. Nothing will happen to you.

680
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:03,950
We will never give up!

681
01:38:15,975 --> 01:38:20,229
In memory of Josef Gabcik and Jan Kubis, May 27, 2010.
