{3942}{4002}What have you got there, glassmaker?|- Glasses.
{4044}{4168}You'll pay half a crooked groat|or I'll smash the lot to splinters.
{4171}{4260}That's just what I'm afraid of.|Hurry up! Here's another one coming.
{4406}{4494}What have you got there?|- Linen.
{4498}{4612}You'll pay half a crooked groat|or I'll tear the whole lot to shreds.
{4614}{4684}You won't and I won't pay either!
{4686}{4758}You'll pay linen-dealer.
{4760}{4803}No, I won't.
{4806}{4858}Yes, you will.|- No, I won't.
{4869}{4910}What?|- So what!
{4953}{5019}Come on.
{5162}{5256}And why not really?|I'll pay and only too pleased to.
{5258}{5330}But why should you pay after all!|Tell you what - don't pay!
{5347}{5406}Oh, no - of course, I'll pay.
{5408}{5460}OK! OK!
{5462}{5500}Take it and do me a kindness!
{5502}{5594}Well, if you insist.|- And friends for life!
{5793}{5849}What have you got there, Grannie?
{5866}{5945}Healing herbs, Martin.
{5947}{5999}You know me?|- How could I not know you!
{6001}{6098}I nursed you often enough|when you were small.
{6110}{6202}How big is your kingdom?
{6230}{6336}Jack in his seven-league boots|would take a week to cross it.
{6407}{6495}A very big kingdom!
{6529}{6620}All the best, and be good!
{6628}{6683}I'll be good, Grannie!
{6822}{6920}Grannie, who are you?
{6922}{6996}I told you -|the Herb Woman.
{6998}{7086}I know,|but who are you really?
{7088}{7204}If I told you,|you wouldn't believe me.
{7232}{7296}"Why is it called "My Kingdom"?"
{7302}{7354}It's your kingdom, isn't it?
{7356}{7424}We know that,|but the King doesn't.
{7440}{7599}He thinks it's all his - and so he|"calls himself "King We the First"."
{7622}{7696}I don't want to be King|I want to be...
{7698}{7749}I don't know what I want ...
{7754}{7840}besides a King doesn't need to -|if he doesn't want to.
{7848}{7942}A stitch or two there!|- Now it's all right.
{7944}{7981}Well, how does it suit me?
{7983}{8024}Oooh...
{8027}{8071}Oooh yes, or oooh no?
{8075}{8119}Oooh yes!
{8129}{8168}Just as well!
{8173}{8256}I am marrying off my daughter.
{8260}{8296}Which one?
{8307}{8349}I don't know myself which one.
{8352}{8390}And whom will she marry?
{8397}{8469}Smart arse!|Who can a Princess marry but a Prince?
{8471}{8536}Hey, you!|Are the Princes on our soil?
{8545}{8696}Since dawn a glassmaker, a linen-dealer|and an old woman have crossed frontiers.
{8705}{8759}Quite a big tourist traffic.
{8776}{8836}The Princes should have been here.|They have announced themselves ...
{8850}{8891}A sharp pain in my shoulder.
{8893}{8943}And-so-on!|Quick, quick!
{8947}{9026}Your Majesty's health's most|humble servant.
{9028}{9084}A pain like a dagger - there!
{9201}{9270}Pinosa Prickitis.
{9281}{9345}What on earth's that?|- No illness dare attack you -
{9347}{9454}you're as healthy as a turnip.
{9456}{9526}As a turnip?|What a vulgar comparison.
{9533}{9607}Well, say, as a fish - a gold fish.
{9610}{9646}It was a pinprick.
{9650}{9707}You grudge me even a proper illness.
{9721}{9759}You have no real love for me.
{9763}{9787}Ooooh.
{9789}{9835}When I die, you'll not shed a tear.
{9837}{9874}I'll shed one - an enormous one.
{9891}{9941}Would you weep for me?|Would, and how much!
{9947}{9984}Show me how you'd weep.
{10188}{10253}Oh, my king!|- Stop now.
{10275}{10311}That's enough.
{10344}{10386}Show me how you would cry.
{10466}{10503}And you?
{10555}{10674}And how would you weep all together?
{10685}{10724}No! Stop!
{10736}{10793}This is no weeping for me!
{10801}{10876}I'm the one who should weep most ...
{10891}{10977}but of course, as the corpse,|I couldn't!
{11001}{11069}And you would wring your hands?
{11071}{11109}How would you wring your hands?
{11164}{11246}That's no wringing!
{11250}{11289}Show them!
{11406}{11444}This is how you wring!
{11452}{11533}And I'll have a look for the Princes.
{11544}{11608}Practise it a bit!|- Wring!
{11777}{11842}Give it to me.|You have no idea!
{11873}{11960}You must look and not gape.
{12086}{12200}What's this ...|what's this I see?
{12219}{12259}Must be looking abroad.
{12262}{12319}Of course, you've got it at 'infinite'.
{12462}{12559}Now I'm at home ...|Home sweet home!
{12872}{12941}A kingdom like a picture-book.
{13030}{13096}There's a dozen of these little Kubáts!
{13116}{13190}And there they've begun a second dozen.
{13205}{13262}We'll need to order a new census.
{13268}{13315}Well, there might be more of them|coming!
{13497}{13584}Look there! The basket-maker and the|seamstress are married.
{13586}{13654}Oh yes!|- I didn't know.
{13778}{13827}What a woman!
{13844}{13933}But not a trace of the Princes.|As soon as you sight them, report!
{13935}{13971}To me!
{13973}{14031}You fetch the bride -|and remember ...
{14033}{14092}she's your future Queen.|That's enough!
{14094}{14153}You have three daughters, Sire ...
{14161}{14237}which will be my future Queen?
{14240}{14277}True.
{14279}{14331}Bring the three of them!
{14337}{14410}And while I'm getting my regalia ...
{14412}{14474}I'll think it over.
{14486}{14527}Turn the other way -
{14530}{14569}the King is leaving by the secret door.
{16271}{16315}I know, Mary,
{16332}{16390}I never can find anything.
{16410}{16465}I think only of myself and|don't know what I want.
{16470}{16522}As if I heard you.
{16557}{16678}Only this time it's my ermine cloak.
{16734}{16908}I'm marrying my daughter -|no job for a man, Mary.
{17010}{17061}If only you were here to help me.
{17100}{17155}Nobody advises me ...
{17184}{17235}nobody loves me ...
{17270}{17343}And I'm not exaggerating!|Where to goodness
{17363}{17409}have you put that -
{17444}{17492}Sorry, here it is!
{17723}{17793}I've not worn it since our wedding.
{17816}{17930}D'you remember how we said ...
{17944}{18036}... that when out daughters were|safely married ...
{18050}{18116}we'd leave them to reign here ...
{18119}{18174}and go to the seaside ...
{18188}{18237}and enjoy ourselves?
{18282}{18390}And now I have to decide all alone ...
{18435}{18584}whether this kingdom will fall to ...
{18604}{18684}Drahomír or Zpěvanka or Maruka.
{18687}{18767}One of the three - but which one?
{18773}{18818}I love them all equally well ...
{18843}{18885}but each is cast in a different mould.
{18888}{18981}There's Drahomír ... When they showed|her to me the first time,
{18986}{19060}I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
{19102}{19180}As ugly an infant as you could|set eyes upon!
{19193}{19334}But far and near you'll not find|a fairer - more graceful or
{19339}{19378}vainer creature.
{19412}{19536}How often she made us laugh|dolling herself up -
{19594}{19729}And then I had to lift her -|to let her see herself in the mirror!
{19732}{19772}And it suits her even today.
{19775}{19889}A queen all right -|but more for the eye!
{19896}{19954}Our second-born Zpěvanka -
{19958}{20039}must have come from a fairy-land -
{20047}{20182}of laughter and song and dance.
{20203}{20310}Only I don't know how she would reign|in this sad and sober world.
{20313}{20395}Our people you'd maybe think her ...
{20398}{20454}... too vocal.
{21945}{22069}Here he is again, and again|and again ...
{22361}{22397}Don't pipe, piper.
{22416}{22453}Can't you hear?
{22470}{22507}Can't you speak?
{22510}{22546}You're crazy!
{22553}{22592}He's crazy.
{22603}{22668}Crazy all right - but about you!
{22688}{22812}Can a Queen have a piper for her swain?
{22845}{22934}Yes, but a singer can never be|a Queen and reign.
{22946}{23020}A larel wreath suits the royal head|better,
{23025}{23124}than a golden tingaling-ling-ling!
{23227}{23311}You lie in your songster's throat,|sister ...
{23313}{23351}I shall be Queen!
{23353}{23389}We'll see about that!
{23391}{23504}Only you've forgotten, tralala!
{23511}{23594}There's still Maruka, ha, ha, ha!
{23616}{23677}A fine Queen she'd make!
{23695}{23745}I wonder what she's got on this time.
{23827}{23876}Sister!|- Maruka!
{23886}{23928}Maruka!
{23933}{23983}Boys, haven't you seen Maruka?
{24042}{24086}Oh, here you are, princess Maruka!
{24088}{24182}The King wishes to decide -|which of you will be Queen.
{24187}{24277}Take off your apron and|dress in your best.
{24280}{24379}An apron suits me much better|then a crown.
{24383}{24432}You never can tell.
{24444}{24518}Maybe it would,|if you speak so wisely.
{24521}{24579}Where have you come from, Old Woman?
{24585}{24669}I sell sweet spices. Vanilla ...
{24675}{24824}nutmeg and cinnamon,|whatever you like.
{24833}{24869}I have everything.
{24871}{25095}Saffron, pepper, sweet marjoram|and mustard.
{25116}{25163}All these we'll buy from you,|Grannie.
{25165}{25211}Cook, bring the scales.
{25239}{25292}And no salt?|- Only spices.
{25295}{25346}But salt is more precious than|any spice!
{25351}{25435}I said the royal crown|would suit you well.
{25570}{25685}It will be Maruka.|She's the wisest and
{25691}{25793}Ioves me - like you used to love me.
{25855}{25916}Thank you, Mařenka.
{25992}{26080}Let the Princesses enter and|the band play!
{26252}{26288}Where's Maruka?
{26326}{26366}She'll be here in a moment.
{26385}{26462}The one I was counting on most|doesn't even bother.
{26563}{26605}She was seeing to things in the kitchen.
{26607}{26660}The kitchen's everything and|I'm nothing.
{26667}{26763}When they lay me under the sod|not a soul will care a jot.
{26778}{26895}I'm going to beg now, I'm an old man.|My own daughters will drive me out.
{26900}{26974}But daddy!|Silence!
{26982}{27018}Silence!
{27021}{27092}One's as bad as the other|or the third one.
{27186}{27263}Don't hurry.|Take your time.
{27269}{27336}It's only your father waiting for you.
{27518}{27588}Hear!
{27733}{27794}When the Fates spin my life's thread|to an end ...
{27823}{27947}... and my throne stands empty ...
{27956}{28080}When my daughters lay aside|the veil of mourning,
{28146}{28215}skirmishes and squabbles for the Crown
{28226}{28292}may threaten the unity of the land.
{28327}{28401}But be not downhearted, my subjects!
{28403}{28487}You King and Sovereign has found|a solution.
{28551}{28637}Today I shall designate
{28651}{28703}as Queen the daughter
{28705}{28829}who loves me, her King and|Father best.
{28862}{28911}This is my will!
{29046}{29110}Come forward, Drahomír ...
{29142}{29196}and tell me how much you love me.
{29217}{29287}I love you -|like gold.
{29317}{29441}Gold -|a rare element!
{29485}{29587}Why not?|Very good, Drahomír.
{29602}{29676}And you, Zpěvanka,|how much do you love me?
{29685}{29774}Daddy, Your Majesty ...
{29787}{29824}I love you like gold, too.
{29835}{29874}Now wait, we've had that!
{29876}{29954}Like the gold in my throat -|this gold!
{31109}{31203}A pity you Mother isn't here|what a joy it would have been for her.
{31222}{31294}I see and hear that you love me truly.
{31323}{31366}Now only Maruka is left.
{31375}{31426}Say, how much do you love me?
{31451}{31559}I love you like ...
{31565}{31664}I love you ... like only|a daughter can love her father.
{31689}{31791}But that's only your duty,|isn't it?
{31815}{31861}Anybody can come up with that!
{31863}{31915}Take an example from your sisters.
{31921}{31990}Now once more:|You live me like - what?
{32051}{32087}I'll help you.
{32091}{32215}Besides gold there are other|rare things ...
{32335}{32420}I love you like salt!
{32471}{32521}Like what?|- Like salt.
{32523}{32609}Salt.|Salt?
{32663}{32744}Yes, salt, because we can't do|without it.
{32794}{32918}That's something everybody|has enough of.
{32980}{33061}D'you mean to say that you've had|enough of me?
{33063}{33100}Daddy ...
{33109}{33193}My own child is tired of me!|My own blood and she's had enough of me!
{33229}{33304}Thank God your Mother didn't live|to see this day!
{33309}{33351}Daddy, you don't know|what I meant.
{33353}{33399}You don't know, but you know|everything.
{33415}{33467}Teaching her grandmother|to suck eggs!
{33469}{33530}Daddy, do be reasonable!
{33533}{33577}And saucy you are, too!
{33580}{33639}Sa I'm not reasonable.
{33643}{33680}Isn't it too funny?
{33683}{33757}No! It's quite the contrary!
{33788}{33839}So I'm funny an I? Make you laugh?
{33844}{33903}Go from my house, unhappy one!
{33909}{33945}Out you go!
{34047}{34108}Out!
{34633}{34684}Go home, doggie!
{34947}{35007}Your Majesty, where are you?|I am here!
{35035}{35095}I've been looking for you|every where!
{35111}{35147}They're here!|- Who?
{35150}{35226}Came a different way!
{35228}{35284}Who?|- The Princes!
{35309}{35366}Princes?|That's a nice kettle of fish!
{35368}{35405}How many?|- Three.
{35407}{35455}Three!|And Princesses?
{35457}{35505}Two.|- Two. And one throne.
{35507}{35571}That's six altogether.|Altogether - how's that?
{35575}{35652}Three, two and one are six!|- Yes six. No!
{35654}{35707}Only one throne|but Princesses ...
{35709}{35789}... two.|At the moment two. But Maruka is sure ...
{35806}{35883}Maruka, poor thing, you drove|her out.
{35885}{35922}I beg your pardon?|- Of course you did.
{35925}{35969}Actually I did.
{35975}{36017}But she'll come back, I know ...
{36022}{36067}she can't be without me.|She'll regret it!
{36069}{36136}I know her!|By nightfall she'll be here.
{36138}{36186}By nightfall there'll be seven.|What are you saying, seven?
{36188}{36250}Well, yes.|- Yes. Three Princes and one throne.
{36252}{36306}Leave the throne out of it!|- I can't.
{36309}{36357}It's the throne that counts.|You don't have to!
{36359}{36410}No, you're mixing me up
{36413}{36481}counting pears and apples together.
{36483}{36507}Than what counts?
{36509}{36551}That three Princes are not|three Princesses ...
{36553}{36628}but only two.|- Yes, I mean - no.
{36645}{36688}Stop that maths exercise!
{36690}{36751}Stop mixing me up,|when I've got to decide.
{36753}{36824}Yes, but the Princes are waiting.
{36827}{36876}I don't want to see them ...
{36894}{36959}not now.
{36972}{37041}Tell them to rest and
{37044}{37139}change for dinner.
{37152}{37219}Then it will be dark|and Maruka will be here.
{37240}{37277}And now hop it!
{37361}{37401}Hop it!
{37403}{37439}Hop what?
{37441}{37468}Skedaddle!
{37470}{37546}I see. Skedaddle.
{37553}{37611}Very witty!
{37615}{37674}So I'm skedaddling, skedaddling ske ...
{37715}{37752}What am I to say to them?
{37754}{37814}Sing to them, if you like,
{37816}{37858}but keep them back.
{38334}{38425}In the King's name,
{38427}{38551}I welcome you ...
{38591}{38664}I, And-so-on, that's me,
{38675}{38738}And-so-on.
{38755}{38879}I, myself, the King's other self,
{38936}{39060}I, myself, the King's other self,
{39104}{39186}And-so-on.
{39252}{39312}I change my function at|his injunction,
{39314}{39374}From Groom-in-Waiting|to Chief Physicians
{39376}{39439}Scribe, barber,|Lord High Chamberlain,
{39522}{39646}As Companion to the Crown,|I drink with him from night to morn,
{39670}{39768}I weep with him and sing with him,
{39772}{39881}I weep with him and sing with him,
{39889}{39992}I, And-so-on, from night|to morn,
{40000}{40124}I'm sitting with him by a jug.
{40176}{40279}We have consultations and|disputations,
{40285}{40409}If he hits me,|then he apologizes,
{40437}{40485}The long and the short of it is,|I am His Majesty's ...
{40487}{40534}The long and the short of it is,|I am His Majesty's ...
{40536}{40637}Chief Counsellor,
{40639}{40714}And-so-on, And-so-on,|And-so-on, And-so-on,
{40716}{40834}And so on, my great prestige.
{40844}{40968}And so on,|And so on my name.
{41028}{41092}I cannot introduce myself|so finely, but ...
{41094}{41149}Not necessary! I know who you are.
{41152}{41193}You are the Handsome Prince, son of ...
{41195}{41243}King Alabaster the Sixteenth.
{41245}{41328}Right.|You are the Brave Prince, son of ...
{41354}{41395}King Děloslav the Eighth.
{41397}{41463}Right.|And you are the Wise Prince ...
{41465}{41521}Son of my Father.|I see.
{41552}{41672}I shall accompany you to your chambers,|you must be tired after your journey.
{42013}{42051}What are you spying for here,|Gardener?
{42053}{42090}I'm taking care of you.
{42092}{42154}You never could climb trees.
{42156}{42193}But now I'm big.
{42272}{42310}And as awkward as ever!
{42415}{42455}Take care of Drahomír.
{42488}{42529}Why do you call it that?
{42536}{42647}Because it's well-grown, like you,|has a sweet perfume, like you ...
{42650}{42724}But pricks.|- Like you.
{42737}{42778}Give it to me.
{42907}{43001}Keep it.|I've a prettier one, a golden one.
{43003}{43040}Golden roses have no scent.
{43046}{43086}But it is lovelier to look at.
{43119}{43203}A rose without scent ...|is like a beauty without a heart.
{44214}{44288}Our bogs are not for you,|Princess.
{44291}{44328}Put me down.
{44342}{44394}As you wish.|- Ouch.
{44447}{44511}You won't get far not knowing the area!
{44514}{44569}Where are you making for?|- There!
{44591}{44631}To the wood there?
{44634}{44699}But it's a deep wood.|- So what!
{44710}{44764}Aren't you afraid?|- No.
{44797}{44850}Why are you so short with me?
{44856}{44944}I'm sad, and|no more questions.
{45789}{45834}We're on dry land again.
{45942}{45993}Good bye, fisherman!
{46008}{46064}Stay!|It will soon be dark ...
{46066}{46114}and my hut is near.
{46116}{46159}Not now.
{46163}{46219}One day I shall return.
{46232}{46282}Good bye, fisherman.
{49791}{49851}Come away in, lassie.
{49914}{49994}Come in,|there's nobody here.
{50044}{50082}Don't be afraid!
{50111}{50166}You must be hungry.
{50169}{50222}Make some garlic soup.
{50279}{50379}The firewood's dry ...
{50384}{50461}if you know how to light it.
{50567}{50666}I see you do, Maruka.
{50701}{50805}Sit down now,|the soup will be ready in a little.
{50816}{50895}It's not going to be this easy|every day!
{50901}{50977}Only today, because|you've done so much running about.
{50996}{51038}Sit down.
{51351}{51421}Lovely smell!
{51423}{51492}I must taste it.
{51519}{51560}Good evening.
{51589}{51671}Oh, it's you, Grannie?
{51678}{51771}Yes, before I get all|the little ones to sleep.
{51778}{51884}The shoemaker's Anička,|won't fall asleep!
{51912}{51963}You were a little afraid, weren't you?
{51970}{52047}Yes, but not unpleasantly.
{52096}{52190}How do you do it?
{52193}{52275}Who knows everything has|nothing to learn.
{52280}{52382}Besides it was an exception today.
{52393}{52444}What would we have hands for?
{52454}{52534}I'll do it myself.|You cut the bread.
{52869}{52951}So salt is more precious than gold?
{52953}{52977}Isn't it true?
{52979}{53075}Before we discover,|we'll have our supper.
{53097}{53190}Your majesty,|enjoy your royal meal!
{53193}{53243}Eels, oysters...
{53252}{53302}What are you saying?|Is it dark outside?
{53304}{53344}Pitch dark!
{53346}{53417}I wouldn't say so!|- Well, not dark, but
{53420}{53498}there's nothing to be seen.
{53642}{53724}Tell me, Handsome Prince,|is it dark outside?
{53726}{53806}Darkness interests only the ugly -
{53808}{53890}because it covers up their ugliness.
{53912}{53955}Darkness is not my case.
{53957}{54017}Wise Prince, what think you?|Is it dark?
{54019}{54061}It depends on what you mean by dark.
{54083}{54141}It's not dark as pitch ...
{54144}{54246}if it were, you could export it.
{54250}{54349}Some monarchs pay a good price|for pitch darkness.
{54352}{54409}Well, is it dark or not?
{54411}{54489}Command me and I shall make darkness.
{54539}{54584}We'd better have our meal.
{54640}{54764}Eels, oysters, lobsters, lampreys,
{54784}{54908}salmon, trout, caviar.
{54941}{55065}Wild duck and blackcock grilled
{55080}{55204}with peach flavouring and basted|with wine.
{55226}{55290}Enough!|A herring.
{55302}{55377}A herring|for everybody!
{55921}{56045}Tasty, isn't it?
{56077}{56115}Excellent, isn't it?
{56118}{56228}Tasty -|a real delicacy!
{56268}{56328}And the lovely smell!|And have you tried the head?
{56330}{56413}Try the head -|crisp as a lettuce!
{56423}{56509}Well, do you like it?|You don't like it?
{56517}{56558}And why?
{56567}{56636}You don't know?|I'll tell you:
{56639}{56694}Because it's salt.
{56734}{56783}Yes, salt.
{56842}{56879}Not even the dog wants it.
{56881}{57005}A dumb creature -|and knows how common salt is!
{57033}{57087}What am I saying! Taste! Tasteless!
{57090}{57189}Only my own blood,|my own daughter.
{57406}{57442}It's dark!
{58339}{58399}So late and the girl's not home yet.
{58443}{58497}Leaves her father's house|just like that ...
{58553}{58661}Maybe she's in the garden -|hiding!
{58881}{58924}What kind of inventions these are!
{58931}{58981}Tinder box ...,|useless!
{59044}{59091}I'll show her up!
{59094}{59168}I'll show up the whole kingdom!
{59173}{59264}Maruka!|Maruka!
{59285}{59321}Maruka!
{59376}{59412}Daddy!
{59842}{59880}Grannie!
{59973}{60075}Grannie!|Grannie!
{60077}{60175}You dreamt your Dad was calling you -
{60177}{60261}and you wanted to go back, didn't you?
{60264}{60330}I did, Grannie.|Well, do as you like,
{60337}{60461}if you think the time is ripe?
{60476}{60569}The time is ripe?|I miss him so.
{60576}{60667}All because of the salt!|And who was right?
{60679}{60715}I was.
{60717}{60794}But I long for him so -
{60796}{60857}and he for me, too, I'm sure.|- Maybe.
{60860}{60929}Give him time and|he'll find out
{60932}{61034}that Truth can't be shouted down|or driven out.
{61043}{61138}Have patience -
{61144}{61209}Truth's worth suffering for.
{61211}{61281}If only he knew I was safe!
{61283}{61334}It couldn't be managed, Grannie!
{61352}{61392}You're in luck.
{61397}{61508}Here are the two herbs I need.
{61656}{61768}Smell this one and you'll be invisible.
{61771}{61835}Smell again and you'll appear.
{61842}{61879}Try it.
{61882}{61993}You sniffed too little.
{62001}{62107}Never do anything by halves!|Not even miracles!
{62112}{62161}Breathe in harder!
{62185}{62221}What now, Grannie?
{62223}{62326}Wish you were at the Castle|and the other herb will take you there.
{62328}{62387}I wished, bud I'm still here.
{62390}{62524}I forgot to pick it - how stupid!
{62542}{62595}Smell again.
{62702}{62801}We'll go to the wood for it.
{62811}{62935}I want to sleep,|I want to sleep.
{62979}{63028}I want to sleep!
{63031}{63088}What do I want?|To sleep I want.
{63090}{63141}Sleep I what?|Want!
{63143}{63214}Who wants to sleep?|Not me!
{63216}{63259}I can't get to sleep.
{63261}{63299}But you are asleep.
{63301}{63337}Not at all!
{63375}{63446}Maruka, do I wake or dream?
{63448}{63486}Dreaming, of course.
{63488}{63568}Could I do that except in a dream?
{64048}{64161}So you're only a dream?|You're a beautiful dream!
{64177}{64251}I couldn't get to sleep for ages.|They didn't make my bed properly!
{64253}{64321}Nobody makes my bed like you.
{64323}{64377}Mummy have me some hard drill in it!
{64379}{64415}Oh yes, mummy!
{64425}{64490}I'm sorry we never had a fleet.
{64492}{64559}Your Mother was a born admiral.
{64565}{64634}You'll never get to sleep like that!
{64637}{64702}Amn't I sleeping?|- Yes, but uneasily.
{64704}{64762}I'm sleeping quite easily.|See how easily I'm sleeping.
{64764}{64863}I'm dreaming about my dearest daughter.
{64888}{64982}But when I wake up,|I'll be worried again.
{64986}{65049}But in the morning I'll have new|worries, what's up with you?
{65051}{65093}Don't worry.
{65098}{65182}I'm safe and you're my dearest Dad.
{65202}{65293}And you are my pigheaded little girl,
{65295}{65397}who has come back and|Dad has forgiven her.
{65405}{65481}Forgiven her what?|- That nonsense about the salt.
{65484}{65538}You've nothing to forgive me.
{65544}{65609}If you're going to talk back,|be gone!
{65613}{65671}Say the word and I shall!
{65676}{65740}No, no, wait a minute!
{65771}{65869}So salt is still more precious|than gold?
{65875}{65912}And isn't it?|- No.
{65914}{65974}Everybody can get on without salt.|- I'd like to see it!
{65976}{66014}And we will se it!
{66018}{66209}I'll destroy all the salt -|to the last pinch!
{66211}{66247}And how will you do it?
{66250}{66295}You should know it,|if you're so clever!
{66298}{66419}Give orders for all salt to be brought|here and we'll throw it into water.
{66423}{66467}Now away to beddibyes!
{66476}{66547}Dreams don't sleep,|and I'm your dream.
{66556}{66606}Yes, you are my dream.
{66619}{66692}My dream is my dream ...
{66701}{66779}and must obey like clockwork.
{66786}{66838}And no trifling.
{66850}{66907}I'm not dreaming - you are dreaming.
{66916}{66985}No, you are dreaming - I'm not dreaming.
{66997}{67059}Who's dreaming?
{67073}{67139}What are you pushing yourself|into my dream for?
{67141}{67222}I only wanted to ask|who you're abusing.
{67224}{67276}Who ... Whom ... Why ... are you complaining?
{67295}{67413}Why do you wish me to dream about you,|when I'm dreaming about Maruka?
{67453}{67519}She was here and is gone -
{67523}{67560}all your fault!
{67562}{67611}Maruka!|Where is she?
{67647}{67687}Where is she?|Maruka!
{67730}{67779}Where are you, Maruka?
{67803}{67839}Maruka!|She's gone.
{67841}{67872}She's gone.|Maruka!
{67875}{67911}Maruka!
{68075}{68155}But if she's gone,|which one are you gone on?
{68162}{68220}Which one am I gone on?
{68244}{68314}Of course Maruka's the one|I'm gone on!
{68441}{68541}Who's doing that?
{68673}{68741}What's wrong with you?|Do you feel sick?
{68745}{68825}Oh no, somebody's tickling me!|Somebody's tickling me.
{68943}{68980}Out, you clown!
{68994}{69051}I'm a clown?|- You're a clown.
{69054}{69142}Quarrelling with a chair,|your cap rising on your head,
{69144}{69208}my candle snuffed out,|Somebody tickling me,
{69210}{69259}and I'm a clown.
{69288}{69374}I'm offended.
{69403}{69439}I'm leaving!
{69531}{69640}And I can't even ask|who'll be Queen?
{69643}{69680}Not the Pigheaded one!
{69682}{69744}Let the Princes themselves decide.
{69746}{69792}And come and put out my candle.
{69835}{69893}Well, what's up with you?|Hear me?
{69925}{69982}Well, are you coming?|- I'm coming!
{70101}{70137}And out you go!
{70151}{70240}The stupidest dream I've ever had!
{70453}{70507}I'll wake up out of it.
{70509}{70574}I want to wake up,|I want to wake up!
{70587}{70653}I want to wake up,|I want to wake up!
{70671}{70795}What do I want?|To wake up.
{70878}{70957}Good night, Daddy.|- Good night.
{71576}{71661}A lovely day, isn't it?|- Perfect.
{71701}{71770}And how have we slept?|- Too soft a couch.
{71791}{71845}I prefer a battlefield.
{71878}{71965}And the din of battle doesn't|disturb you?
{71976}{72071}After the battle,|the victorious battle!
{72126}{72197}From my room I see three lovely|apple-trees
{72211}{72335}above a crystal-clear well.
{72350}{72453}Well.|A' propos, cook!
{72464}{72539}Is the water in the well|living or dead?
{72542}{72616}I don't know.|I don't drink water.
{72618}{72690}Living water is excellent|for the complexion.
{72692}{72758}I'm just thinking...|Cook!
{72778}{72849}Do these apple-trees bear|golden fruit?
{72875}{72962}I'd like to graft golden apples|on out trees at home.
{72984}{73039}Even if they bore little,|it would be without work.
{73051}{73096}Do you like to work?
{73098}{73176}I mustn't. Work makes people ugly.
{73184}{73242}I'm spoiling for a fight.
{73260}{73303}Hey, idler, listen!
{73305}{73418}Isn't there some gloomy ravine nearby|where wild dragons have their lair?
{73423}{73511}Dragons?|Wild rabbits maybe!
{73514}{73608}Dragons, that's my line.
{73623}{73674}Six heads at a stroke!
{73711}{73749}Have you some hot water?
{73751}{73804}Yes, but the kitchen is still closed.
{73809}{73891}Where the devil are you?
{73898}{73935}If you excuse me...
{73939}{73987}Quick to the wooing!
{73989}{74036}The Princesses are in the garden,|by chance -
{74038}{74100}and you - by chance - are to meet them.
{74102}{74226}Address them, caress them,|woo them -
{74255}{74324}and the one you like best is yours!
{74326}{74368}And what about this?|So.
{74370}{74432}You can eat your fill|at the wedding feast.
{74573}{74612}And now we are free of that!
{74702}{74749}Isn't it too little for two?
{74757}{74817}We're not going to give them|everything.
{74819}{74895}Princes! Drones!
{75109}{75149}Shall we go?
{75226}{75302}... and having cut through the hedge -
{75323}{75432}he entered the Castle where|all was asleep -
{75485}{75574}the Sleeping Beauty, too, of course.
{75586}{75651}And the Handsome Prince kissed her ...
{75653}{75709}and the Princess woke up.
{75720}{75762}We know that one.
{75787}{75874}You know that, but you don't know|who the handsome Prince was!
{75886}{75927}It was me!
{75930}{76019}And have you heard of Snow White?|The one who served the dwarfs.
{76047}{76171}How she slept in a glass coffin|and a Prince came and kissed her.
{76227}{76266}That was you, too!
{76273}{76331}Yes - so you know that?|- And then they got married.
{76333}{76432}And the same with the Sleeping Beauty.|The way it always ends after all ...
{76436}{76558}They got married and lived|happily ever after.
{76569}{76618}That's only in the fairy-tale.
{76620}{76705}I didn't marry her.|I never wanted to get married -
{76709}{76827}till I met you!
{76833}{76893}Love has put my heart in a turmoil.
{76900}{76986}Listen!|Do you hear it beating?
{77038}{77075}What are you doing here?|Learning to shoot.
{77077}{77113}Why?|If a bear came, I'd shoot it.
{77115}{77168}What would a bear be doing here?
{77170}{77217}Seeking honey.|But we haven't any bees.
{77219}{77284}They might swarm here.|Have you seen the swarm?
{77286}{77324}No, I haven't.
{77330}{77392}Well, go and look for it!|Right.
{77427}{77484}Fools must be fooled!
{77487}{77540}Don't I know it!
{77542}{77624}Fooling fools is my business!
{77634}{77733}It's like the Prince who rescued|the Princess from the clutches of
{77735}{77817}a twenty-headed dragon.|- It was you, wasn't it?
{77819}{77843}Not likely.
{77845}{77875}It was a fool.
{77877}{77963}I knew the Princess:|she wasn't worth it.
{77965}{78084}But if it had been you -|touch wood -
{78095}{78159}the dragon might have had forty or
{78166}{78238}hundred heads!
{78240}{78309}Save himself who can, run for it!
{78311}{78356}I've missed it!|- Whom?
{78407}{78459}Save himself who can, run for it!
{78507}{78554}Save us!|- Save us!
{78598}{78683}Yes, of course. Just wait|till I get my mail.
{78943}{79018}What a surprise!|Well I never, it isn't a bear after all!
{79060}{79112}Something worse - a piper!
{79117}{79172}You might be ashamed spoiling|our chances!
{79175}{79212}D'you want us to be old maids?
{79214}{79272}And you want to marry such|popinjays?
{79613}{79699}What did I say to her then?|- If I only knew!
{79725}{79812}Wait, wait, it...|Once again!
{79827}{79932}She made the bed and said she was safe.
{79934}{80011}Don't begin again,|or it will take you like that night!
{80015}{80075}The bath will help you.
{80154}{80213}We quarrelled about salt,
{80216}{80261}and I said,
{80295}{80343}if only I knew,|what I said to her!
{80345}{80404}You told me I was a clown -
{80410}{80467}but I've forgiven you for that.
{80469}{80519}You'd nothing to forgive me.
{80529}{80595}That's it! She said I'd nothing|to forgive her.
{80597}{80638}It's getting cold!
{80640}{80718}But I wanted to show that I was right,
{80721}{80817}but how - that's what I can't remember.
{80819}{80892}But you will remember,|you will remember, you will!
{81038}{81112}A wonderful bath!|Most refreshing!
{81114}{81172}What's that?|- Bath salts.
{81186}{81233}I'll dissolve them in water ...
{81235}{81271}Dissolve them in water!
{81273}{81349}That's what I said and that's|what I'll do!
{81387}{81428}I know you will do that!
{81432}{81459}Salt!
{81461}{81538}Bring all the salt to me!|To the Castle!
{81546}{81621}Salt!
{81629}{81753}I command all my subjects,|without delay,
{81785}{81909}to hand over their last|grain of salt.
{81946}{82024}All salt!
{82030}{82154}Not a grain less,|not a grain less, to the Castle!
{82188}{82280}By order of King We the First!
{82943}{83058}Next, please!
{83173}{83210}Next, please!
{83494}{83531}Next, please!
{83612}{83648}Next, please!
{83796}{83871}That's all?|- No, but I'm not giving any more.
{83901}{83989}You dare to oppose the King's command?
{83991}{84041}Command?
{84043}{84080}It's madness!
{84082}{84118}Shut your gab, woman!
{84125}{84191}Not before you and
{84193}{84288}your King hear something.|He knows why he keeps out of sight.
{84319}{84361}He's ashamed - that's it.
{84363}{84429}He was always a bit daft,|but we said -
{84431}{84486}no matter if he has a good heart.
{84489}{84563}But yesterday he drove out Maruka -|and today he's taking our salt.
{84569}{84624}Without any real reason!|Salt!
{84629}{84738}Not even the cattle can do without it -|woodland animals will go miles for it.
{84743}{84786}If the wiseacre does not know it,
{84788}{84854}let him ask my little Majdalenka,|she will tell him!
{84856}{84966}What shall we salt with, you botcher?
{84976}{85027}Me? Botcher?
{85029}{85116}You brazen tongue.|I'll throw you into prison.
{85125}{85176}Me?|- You ...
{85404}{85469}Hell's bells, that's a woman for you!
{85471}{85543}She's right, too.|What will folk salt with?
{85545}{85622}With nothing.|And so shall you.
{85625}{85705}It won't be fit to eat.|- Flummery, mummery!
{85758}{85794}Next, please!
{86048}{86085}What's up?
{86128}{86194}You couldn't come along|with the rest?
{86196}{86251}Who are you?|- The Herb Woman.
{86254}{86292}The Herb Woman.
{86454}{86508}Are you at home here?
{86519}{86569}Yes, I'm at home everywhere.
{86575}{86632}Yes, I'm at home everywhere.|Yes, I'm at home everywhere.
{86634}{86719}I'll pour it ...
{86793}{86896}out for you.
{86935}{86979}A nice old Grannie -
{87005}{87088}I seem to know you.
{87110}{87195}But that's quite a long time ago...
{87354}{87424}Tell you what, keep your salt.
{87452}{87546}If the King should need it,|he can always have it.
{87633}{87699}Where have I seen that old woman before?
{87891}{87938}Everything completed!|Everything done!
{87940}{87993}It's not.|But all the salt...
{87997}{88093}I'm not done with it yet.
{88164}{88245}Every grain of that worthless mineral|throw into water and drown
{88248}{88292}like a kitten!|lmmediately!
{88829}{88930}Maruka!|Maruka!
{89179}{89303}Moon, tell me, where is Maruka?
{89406}{89530}When the water breathes deep|from the bottom,
{89601}{89725}and a tree trails its branch|in the foam,
{89778}{89902}while a dragonfly restlessly flitting
{89948}{90054}turns a stalk into an emerald stone.
{90313}{90390}No, my song has not enough passion,
{90436}{90510}but each other's eyes we shall plumb,
{90554}{90678}In the silence I hear your heart beating
{90733}{90857}and you hear mine beat like a drum.
{90969}{91037}That's the end of the song?
{91044}{91166}No. One more verse|about the deepest silence.
{91195}{91241}Sing it then.
{91271}{91379}Only two can sing that.|- I know the melody. Teach me the words.
{91386}{91461}It has neither melody nor words.
{91494}{91533}How is it sung then?
{91612}{91649}Like this.
{91904}{91994}Maruka!|Maruka!
{92155}{92231}Maruka, where are you?|Maruka!
{92239}{92302}She'll come back to you.
{92328}{92428}You're the kindest Grannie!|I was afraid you'd be angry with me.
{92430}{92497}Why? I know your fisherman,
{92500}{92569}a good lad.
{92572}{92666}But now take a good look!
{92824}{92883}To prove that I am right ...|- You always are!
{92887}{92992}I've ordered a banquet undefiled|pork banquet,
{93004}{93079}by a grain of salt - without which
{93085}{93204}food is said to be unpalatable.
{93273}{93472}Well, I'm ceremonially opening|the first salt-free pork feast ever.
{93483}{93524}Bon appetit!
{93539}{93576}Music!
{95089}{95197}Eat your fill and drink with a will!
{95222}{95314}I don't know about you,|but I've enjoyed it.
{95328}{95364}So have we.
{95396}{95471}Still, it might have been better.
{95473}{95525}Not without salt it can't.
{95527}{95584}Oh, yes.|We have a variety of tastes.
{95586}{95662}What's sweet|mustn't be salt.
{95700}{95785}Tomorrow prepare a sweet feast.
{97364}{97399}Enough!|Pardon?
{97401}{97437}Enough!
{97715}{97793}What's the idea?|- We have a variety of tastes.
{97795}{97852}What's sour|mustn't be salt.
{97854}{97931}How dare you talking to me like that?|- Give me salt and your appetite
{97933}{97986}will come back.|- Salt, salt!
{97988}{98057}To cook with salt is no art ...|... but without it!
{98059}{98107}Can't be done.|- It can.
{98109}{98161}No, it can't.|- I'll prove it can.
{98163}{98200}I'll do the cooking.
{98202}{98245}And I'll look on.|- You won't,
{98247}{98292}because I'll throw you into prison.
{98294}{98341}You made the prison|into wine-cellar.
{98343}{98406}We'll shut him up there.|Looks like a barrel anyhow.
{98429}{98509}Pan..., pancake..., pancakes ...|Here it is!
{98529}{98604}Pleasing to the palate of king and|cottar are golden pancakes
{98606}{98670}light as a feather.|- Well, that's it. So, read it!
{98694}{98787}Prepare a dough of yeast, eggs, sugar,|flour, warm milk,
{98789}{98874}lemon peel and ...
{98883}{98919}Read it!
{98921}{98989}Lemon peel and ...
{98991}{99051}And what?|- And salt!
{99061}{99143}I told you salt was needed!|- You half-baked doughnut!
{99155}{99217}We'll put spices instead.
{99258}{99300}Give it to me, we'll start immediately!
{99322}{99401}Break one or two eggs ...
{99441}{99482}What are you doing?
{99488}{99537}One OR two eggs.
{99545}{99651}One OR two eggs -|that's three eggs.
{99654}{99716}That's true.|So, peck one egg open.
{99778}{99835}They must be hard-boiled.
{99876}{99957}No, they're not!|We must try a different method ...
{99971}{100025}Pass one or two eggs.|- I'll take three at once.
{100027}{100063}Put them into the mortar
{100086}{100124}and let's get on with it!
{100145}{100194}What about the shells?
{100210}{100246}All eggs have shells
{100248}{100309}to keep them together.
{100313}{100384}At least the pancakes will be|nice and crunchy.
{100386}{100442}Add fragments of glass to it instead!
{100444}{100481}Punish him!
{100548}{100624}Bunglers!
{100670}{100737}There's not much of it.|- There's not!
{100750}{100828}What size of pancakes had you in mind?
{100850}{100949}For the whole Castle ...|... about half an acre.
{100960}{100999}That's a tall order!
{101005}{101041}That first?
{101045}{101082}Flour!
{101104}{101164}Remarkable how heavy it is.
{101166}{101234}If one tackles something|with enthusiasm -
{101236}{101287}it must succeed!|- It must!
{101376}{101445}Just look, my lad!|- Now he isn't looking when he might
{101454}{101490}learn something.
{101492}{101558}He's sitting there green with envy.
{101568}{101618}Let him suffer there!
{101679}{101803}Leave the shadows|that delude you in the skies.
{101840}{101964}And take what mother's care|affords here!
{102243}{102299}It will be fine and crunchy!
{102301}{102360}And now milk.|- Is it warm?
{102362}{102449}Of course.
{102528}{102577}Did you throw in some yeast?|- What?
{102579}{102624}Did you throw in some yeast?
{102626}{102662}Good gracious, I forgot!|- Throw it in there,
{102664}{102717}and I'll throw it in here.|Adequately!
{102753}{102854}Adequately, adequately,|adequately, adequately!
{102858}{102899}That's it.|And now?
{102908}{102966}... and now salt.|- Not salt -
{102968}{103005}spices!
{103008}{103071}For half an acre.|- Right!
{103073}{103129}Caraway seeds?|- How much?
{103134}{103245}According to taste.|- Adequately!
{103256}{103297}Bay-leaf. Why not?
{103300}{103344}Saffron, to give it colour.
{103362}{103400}Adequately, adequately ...
{103402}{103458}Cayenne to give it pep.
{103465}{103553}Mustard to give it sharpness.
{103559}{103625}And nutmeg to taste!
{103627}{103686}What about camomile?|- Shove some in.
{103692}{103729}And sweet marjoram.
{103747}{103838}Thyme, too.|- And ginger!
{103853}{103899}What's the box for?
{103901}{103937}For good measure.
{103981}{104017}What's that?
{104021}{104093}I don't know. Oh, that there?|It's rising.
{104162}{104226}Isn't it rising too much?|- No proportionately.
{104229}{104267}Look! What's it doing?
{104269}{104349}Do something! Add it there!|- Close the door!
{104411}{104482}Close the door, open the door ...|It's going out.
{104484}{104549}Blow on it, blow on it ...|- What should I do?
{104562}{104686}Into the arms the sweet|song of woods,
{104750}{104854}Into the arms the sweet, sweet flavour
{104906}{104943}We'll rise here to death!
{104945}{104997}Help!|- Help!
{105125}{105168}Help!|- What's happened?
{105173}{105237}I order you to come|and help at once!
{105239}{105306}Me too!|- No ordering.
{105310}{105377}Beg me to help you.|- How dare you ...
{105379}{105446}Wait, you have to beg!|Beg!
{105448}{105508}All right - I beg you!|- Too little.
{105510}{105559}You must entreat me.
{105565}{105635}All right - I entreat you.|- That's right!
{105637}{105699}That's a different story!
{105763}{105811}Here you are.|- Well, give it to me and pull!
{105813}{105855}Follow me, follow me!
{105954}{106069}Follow me and don't fear, don't fear!
{106122}{106211}What are we going to do now?|- Keep the door shut and keep it out!
{106240}{106333}Oh, look, I don't want to panic,|but we are lost!
{106362}{106441}We're not lost!|We'll stuff it and hold it!
{106445}{106499}And you, hold me, and push!
{106508}{106657}In the hardest moments only the Ruler|himself always knows what to do!
{106868}{106955}One shouldn't grow old before|one grows wise.
{107020}{107086}Somebody else thought that one out.|- But it fits the case.
{107090}{107178}Your case, because now I know|what I didn't before.
{107180}{107222}See if I know, too.
{107240}{107349}That for special work there|must be specialists.
{107370}{107410}No, I didn't know that.
{107431}{107499}Then they might have been|quite special ...
{107521}{107604}Pancakes.|And will be again.
{107606}{107654}No, they won't.|- You will laugh.
{107657}{107695}And they will be!
{107697}{107740}No, they won't and
{107747}{107854}I'm tired and a bit ashamed.
{107875}{107960}And I feel sad... and I feel like crying.
{107970}{108064}I'll act the clown and make you laugh.
{108081}{108132}An elephant stood in the river Nile
{108140}{108187}with his trunk under water ...
{108189}{108237}a crocodile came and seized his trunk.
{108253}{108291}D'you know what the elephant said?
{108328}{108410}That's a feeble kind of joke.
{108461}{108512}Hem, how much I laughed, man!
{108538}{108628}I'll be a cock.
{108691}{108728}I'll be a bigger cock.
{109077}{109134}I'm glad you think that funny.
{109136}{109205}You'll think so, too!|Come, quick!
{109300}{109351}Take the gold.
{109525}{109574}Why are we doing this?
{109576}{109699}We'll see whether salt's|more precious than gold!
{109702}{109746}She has salt.
{109748}{109772}Who?
{109774}{109841}The buxom little widow that smacked you.
{109843}{109940}We'll give her all the gold|and jewels ...
{109943}{110013}and she'll give use her salt!|I'll salt my bread.
{110025}{110087}... and I'll prove myself right.
{110089}{110133}Load it there!
{110496}{110557}Well, here she lives.|Go and speak to her.
{110559}{110622}I did once.|You try this time.
{110629}{110709}Me?|- Yes, knock on the door.
{110763}{110867}That's easy, that's easy!|You must give three proper banks.
{110919}{110968}What's the row?
{110975}{111029}Oh, what guests!
{111035}{111071}What are you looking for here?
{111073}{111139}I..., I..., I'm not, I'm not|looking for, but...
{111166}{111256}I've something very useful for you -
{111258}{111356}namely, a real, royal,|hall-marked treasure.
{111364}{111438}Such a treasure always pays|in a household.
{111446}{111496}You sleep on a straw mattress?
{111518}{111642}For a little ring like this you can get|three cartloads of eiderdown.
{111695}{111734}Do you go dancing?
{111737}{111837}Put on these emerald earrings -|and your neighbours will turn green!
{111849}{111905}If you don't like your cottage -
{111916}{111995}sell a ruby and buy a farm.
{112008}{112096}You can have the lot -|lock, stock and barrel ...
{112098}{112201}What for?
{112204}{112290}For a bag of salt.|- For a bag of salt?
{112292}{112374}Then I'll salt my bread with diamonds?
{112381}{112424}Or with earrings?
{112432}{112505}Or I'll give the sheep|emeralds to lick?
{112508}{112557}Bugbear! Bugbear!
{112621}{112721}A bugbear in his head.
{112725}{112807}He might be ashamed to|call himself King.
{112810}{112878}You should be ashamed!
{112880}{112924}An old crank with this salt business.
{112928}{112991}What have you done with our salt?|What?
{113002}{113078}If you offered me your whole kingdom,|I won't give you a grain!
{113080}{113133}I'll keep it for good people!
{113485}{113524}What's wrong sister?
{113526}{113571}I feel faint.
{113581}{113632}That's with going hungry.
{113648}{113761}Better starve than eat without salt.
{113766}{113810}Little sister, don't fall!
{113816}{113864}Oooh, what to do?
{113891}{114015}Help us, help us, help us!
{114168}{114292}Help us, help us, help us!
{114749}{114798}Thank you, gardener.
{114828}{114987}I have a headache, my throat|is contracting and my heart pains sharp.
{115341}{115390}Feeling better?
{115425}{115474}Not sorry to be without your jewels?
{115498}{115588}I like to be liked.|- I like you without them.
{115602}{115662}Besides, I've better one.
{115966}{116090}Help us, help us, help us!
{116177}{116232}What's going on?|Why are you calling for help?
{116234}{116310}How come you can talk?|- My Mother taught me.
{116313}{116409}And why didn't you talk before?|- Was there any good talking to you?
{116414}{116524}Good or no good, now you must help.
{116537}{116578}She needs none.
{116602}{116726}But now I'm feeling faint ...
{117848}{117915}My ear.
{117964}{118010}Now the nose!
{118085}{118127}Can you hear it?
{118166}{118222}All Princesses used to lie at my feet.
{118225}{118283}Maybe, I'm getting old
{118295}{118341}or something ...
{118347}{118396}We're taking ourselves off,
{118398}{118484}bag and baggage and Goodbye,|Hungry Kingdom!
{118487}{118531}Going, too?|- Why should I stay, after all?
{118533}{118608}Right,|even courtiers are leaving.
{118614}{118651}A dog's life!
{118653}{118700}Don't you know where that land is -
{118702}{118801}the one flowing with milk and honey?
{118804}{118869}Perhaps across seven rivers.
{118871}{118928}There's a short cut past|the Gingerbread Cottage.
{118930}{118974}Thank you.|- They're going to lose their way there!
{118976}{119077}They won't find anything ...|I've searched every inch of
{119079}{119160}this kingdom -|but everywhere you've got to work.
{119294}{119378}Where are you off to, gentlemen?
{119386}{119448}Should we help?
{119458}{119523}He doesn't mean them,|he means us.
{119602}{119664}Permit us to help you,
{119666}{119723}it's too much for you!
{121022}{121059}What is it?
{121061}{121136}We are wandering in circles.
{121139}{121183}We can't go on.|- We must.
{121193}{121249}All we must do ...
{121251}{121371}is divide the booty here and now.
{121374}{121415}That's right!
{121417}{121473}If we've got to toil -|then each with his own.
{121486}{121574}I can't manage it myself.
{121580}{121655}Help me to get this out of the wood -
{121657}{121844}and I'll give you something for it.|Isn't it share and share alike?
{121933}{121978}Of course, share alike.
{121988}{122068}We two, half and half.
{122071}{122147}And what about me?|- There isn't a third half.
{122155}{122225}And so for you two there won't|be anything.
{122239}{122285}Slowly!
{122287}{122402}That novelty will drill a hole|in your mail.
{122421}{122483}We'll drill a hole in you
{122500}{122538}and everything's ours.
{122546}{122629}I'll do the drilling and|it'll be mine.
{122631}{122673}How come?
{122682}{122764}One shot makes a hole in only one.
{122770}{122866}And another shot makes|a hole in the other.
{122908}{122964}That cannot be denied.
{122968}{123092}Now we needn't waste time|dividing it.
{123333}{123407}Oh, the treasure is going!
{123995}{124094}Look,|what we failed to do today -
{124099}{124140}we can do elsewhere tomorrow.
{124158}{124224}But first we must get out of the wood.
{124604}{124725}The wrong road!|This leads past the gallows.
{124863}{124987}The devil take the gold|and the courtiers -
{125030}{125146}I want just one thing, Maruka,|the truth to dawn on me.
{125164}{125220}Hang it all! If only I knew|what to do at last,
{125233}{125335}only if my eyes would open to see|the truth, before it turns against me.
{125428}{125468}That I've never looked for it?
{125476}{125512}Haven't I installed a telescope -
{125514}{125582}to see far and wide|what everybody's doing?
{125614}{125712}I look into their plates.
{125762}{125804}But a telescope is probably not enough.
{125834}{125958}But I suppose one should go into their|homes and see, hear and understand.
{126046}{126153}I shouldn't be afraid|to go among people?
{126180}{126220}I'm not.
{126263}{126332}I'll go now - into the storm.
{126557}{126609}Come on!|- Wait till it stops raining.
{126611}{126674}If it were to rain hail and brimstone|I won't. - Where will you go?
{126676}{126749}Where the bread is salted and|there's a good king.
{126751}{126827}The one who rules here|is neither good nor a King
{126829}{126911}A king that drives out|his own daughter!
{126913}{126987}Yesterday he took the people's salt,|tomorrow he'll be shaving their heads.
{126989}{127027}And it's joyless here.|- And salt less!
{127035}{127072}Come on, come on!
{127101}{127135}We'll salt our radishes,
{127137}{127185}have a beer ...|- And salt rolls ...
{127187}{127240}and salt herring!
{127262}{127386}It's all right for them.
{127409}{127458}But what about me?
{127467}{127554}I've driven out my daughter,|yesterday I took the people's salt -
{127556}{127606}and tomorrow ...|What am I saying?!
{127631}{127712}Who will help me?
{127729}{127820}I shall.|But I need Maruka.
{127924}{128025}Maruka!|Maruka!
{128114}{128199}You were calling me, Grannie?|- What's that good smell?
{128203}{128236}Fish soup.
{128238}{128294}He's back and terribly hungry.
{128299}{128363}Well,|you'll be back in a moment.
{128380}{128441}But now you must go to your Daddy.
{128443}{128503}Aren't you glad?|- I am.
{128517}{128582}You'd rather make the soup,|is that it?
{128604}{128683}What's up?|I hope that nobody's hurt you?
{128708}{128748}I hurt my Daddy.
{128758}{128844}I always thought I loved only Dad.
{128846}{128925}And now there is room|for the fisherman?
{128936}{128984}That's not why you should be sad.
{129008}{129097}A good heart has room for all|people of good will.
{129153}{129197}It's like with this salt-box.
{129211}{129309}It contains as much salt|as is love in your Dad's heart.
{129323}{129384}Only for his own wants
{129398}{129485}it's not enough.|But if for all,
{129500}{129553}it's bottomless.
{129716}{129816}Maruka!|Oh, I'm asleep again ...
{129818}{129862}and you're my dream.
{129864}{129942}Today your dream -|tomorrow reality.
{129948}{129983}Really genuine?
{129985}{130033}Take care you don't upset the salt.
{130036}{130099}You have salt?|- No more?
{130113}{130193}Isn't it enough?|- It's the people I'm thinking of -
{130195}{130229}for them it's too little.
{130244}{130311}Perhaps it will do.|Let's try it.
{130559}{130636}It's a bottomless salt-box.
{130739}{130777}There's a whole pint of salt in it!
{130818}{130880}Not just a pint,|there's a whole tub of salt in it!
{130911}{130973}A whole heap of salt!|A whole hill of salt!
{130986}{131069}Alps of salt!|Salt for the whole kingdom.
{131071}{131139}Salt for the whole world!|We'll salt our bread, all of us.
{131151}{131221}What d'you say,
{131223}{131274}grand isn't it this salt?
{131276}{131369}It's all thanks to Maruka.|I always said you could depend on her.
{131371}{131414}And I was always good to her,
{131425}{131500}wasn't I Maruka?|Where is she?
{131510}{131605}Maruka?|Maruka! Maruka!
{131615}{131660}I don't care about the salt,|I want Maruka.
{131662}{131725}Maruka! Maruka!...
{132458}{132505}Hello, woman!
{132730}{132794}Hello, woman!
{132857}{132941}Can you hear?
{132947}{133042}Haven't you seen my daughter?
{133077}{133130}You want water?
{133141}{133179}No. Haven't you seen my girl?
{133207}{133285}You head's in a whirl?
{133287}{133411}No, haven't you seen that girl of mine?
{133466}{133590}A glass of wine?
{133622}{133674}No!
{133730}{133844}I have a daughter - young,
{133897}{133960}beautiful, pigheaded ...|I drove my daughter out -
{133962}{134068}broken-hearted - me|I'm seeking her everywhere.
{134070}{134184}If you lost her, find her.
{134186}{134253}So I shall.
{134270}{134353}And it was your King|you were speaking to!
{134767}{134891}Laugh at human misfortune -
{134920}{134968}you silly flowers!
{135032}{135085}I'll show you who's master here.
{135115}{135183}It's still King We the First!
{136689}{136744}What's happened?
{136783}{136854}I'm sinking into the bog.|Help!
{136882}{136974}I'll fossilize - turn into coal -|heat a stove!
{136984}{137014}Do something, folk,
{137017}{137072}wise Mother Nature!
{137076}{137127}Why are you crying here?
{137141}{137206}Deaf woman,
{137215}{137311}one day there will be a tablet:|"Here perished a King"
{137313}{137353}who ruled badly -
{137367}{137409}fed the false,
{137428}{137466}drove out the sincere -
{137470}{137528}called himself King We the First -
{137543}{137620}"and didn't know he was the last."
{137663}{137724}I'm rising!|Now I feel better!
{137745}{137849}I'm rising!
{137860}{137926}You've found firm ground|under your feet.
{137931}{137988}So I won't perish!
{138007}{138080}Long may I live!|Everything can still be put right!
{138083}{138161}Run to the fisher's cottage.|- To the fisher's cottage?
{138165}{138222}For Maruka!|- For Maruka!
{138952}{138995}Daddy!
{139143}{139254}I've got a chill - a whacking big one!
{139277}{139341}The steam is choking me!|But you make good hot grog!
{139347}{139392}I taught her that.
{139402}{139444}You be quiet.|You're not one of the family yet.
{139447}{139497}But you might have written|a line to you Dad.
{139509}{139603}Not because I'm a King.|But father should know everything.
{139645}{139709}Still you haven't made a bad choice.
{139717}{139765}The Crown will suit him quite well.
{139777}{139851}I prefer to keep to my pond.
{139863}{139936}But if you like,|make me Fish Warden.
{139938}{139973}What is he talking?
{139975}{140032}A Queen can't have a fish warden|as consort.
{140036}{140082}I don't wish to be Queen.
{140089}{140138}Who's going to rule?
{140148}{140195}You've made a mess of things -
{140198}{140249}now you must put them right.
{140258}{140315}You're in your prime.
{140357}{140436}Do you think so? In this case|I would manage one more cup.
{140465}{140521}In my prime!
{140631}{140688}If I might say|what I think, then...
{140695}{140742}Then what?|- You should marry again.
{140754}{140835}That's true.|But where would I find ...
{140898}{140936}A bride?
{140938}{141005}She mustn't be one with a monogram|and a crown.
{141029}{141090}Of course she mustn't!
{141106}{141196}She needn't! What should she have|a monogram and a crown for?
{141204}{141284}Wine for the Highest Chief|Fish Warden!
{144860}{144906}What?|- Do you believe now that salt
{144908}{144955}is more precious than gold?
{144957}{145001}I do.
{145017}{145075}And do you know what is more|precious than salt?
{145077}{145126}Everybody knows that -|love, of course!
{145131}{145238}And Love is the Salt of Life!
