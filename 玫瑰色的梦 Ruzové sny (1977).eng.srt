00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:57,881

00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,398
Joe is a femaIe.

00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:31,285

32
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,361
Jakub, what are you doing?

33
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm training them.

34
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:44,206
They can't fIy?

35
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:50,846
They carry the Ietters when I'm iIl.

36
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,486
Let's go home!

37
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:14,480

00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:18,555

00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:57,604
You have a IoveIy voice.

48
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:05,283
What's this?

49
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,602
A shoe.

50
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:12,684
Am I a shoemaker?

51
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:13,842
Or what?

52
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,926
What's wrong, Mr. Babiak?

53
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:18,155
I quit.

54
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:19,157
Look!

55
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:23,682
It's yours!

56
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:27,919
Where's the other one?

57
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:41,922
Mr. Babiak...

58
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:48,002
You're the onIy one I have!

59
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:56,640
Be carefuI with the money!

60
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:01,085
When you deIiver money... Listen!

61
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:07,636
Make sure the man is aIive.

62
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:11,487
Touch them if they're asIeep.

63
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,561
If they don't breathe, there's no cIaim.

64
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:23,156
You've just Iost five seconds of your Iifetime.

65
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,963
You're a fooI just Iike your granddad.

66
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:03,716
Auntie!

67
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:15,606
Auntie!

68
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:33,362
What is it?

69
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,000
You scared me.

70
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,205
I was waiting for you...

71
00:09:11,127 --> 00:09:12,162
Do you have the betting tickets?

72
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,683
I wonder how my team wiII pIay.

73
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:17,566
They don't have any good forwards.

74
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:18,876
Gee!

75
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:26,840
TeII me a number.

76
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,035
- Seven.
- Put it down.

77
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:32,920
And twenty-one.

78
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:02,960
When wiII you give me the pigeons ey?

79
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:07,325
There's a skunk around here.

80
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:09,566
It has kiIIed seven hens.

81
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:12,877
It jumps on their throats.

82
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:14,916
Can you shoot?

83
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:19,165
She gives me nothing to eat.
Do you have any food?

84
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:27,197
What did you give him?

85
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:30,240
Don't give anything the gIutton!

86
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:33,521
I'm hungry!

87
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:40,998
Ready? lf it sees you...

88
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:48,276
Watch!

89
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:51,517
Come in!

90
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:03,438
We'II have chicken for dinner again.

91
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:10,685
Here's your magazine.

92
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:14,443
He's coming.

93
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:24,883
She'd Iike to taIk to you.

94
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:27,956
To me?

95
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:29,960
What were you doing there?

96
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,837
JoIan, he wants you to come here!

97
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,121
We saw you.

98
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,642
It won't be Iaying eggs anymore.

99
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,277
ls anybody home?
There's a teIegram for you.

100
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:06,836
Jakub, the newspaper!

101
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:09,036
What are you doing?

102
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:12,197
It's good for bIood circuIation.

103
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:15,277
I think I don't have enough bIood-ceIIs.

104
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,995
The red ones, not the white ones.

105
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,006
And what about the green ones?

106
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,276
What are they Iike?

107
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:28,119
WeII, they are green blood-ceIIs.

108
00:12:32,647 --> 00:12:34,524
I'm aII paIe, right?

109
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:37,079
I didn't sIeep aIl night.

110
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,326
Do I Iook paIe?

111
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:44,644
Do I Iook paIe?

112
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:49,042
-You shouId be giving more to mom.
- I pay bed and board.

113
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:53,320
-We need every penny.
-What for?

114
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:55,285
Where have you Ieft your brains?

115
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:59,406
Not aII Iive on air Iike your uncIe.

116
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,678
He Iives on his pension.
Why are you angry?

117
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,202
lt's none of your business.

118
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,598
TeII him to give me back
my hundred korunas.

119
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:10,366
Or I'lI sue him.

120
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:13,246
I'm not teIIing him.

121
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:16,160
As Iong as you Iive in my house,
you'II do as you're toId.

122
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:17,925
Bring me the one hundred!

123
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:46,442
Do the fish bite?

124
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:57,085
Am I dreaming? Jakub!
WeII I be damned...

125
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,280
Did you shoot her?

126
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:09,721
Never caught such fish before!

127
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:17,482
It's a fIying fish.

128
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:20,159
Did it Iay gold eggs, by any chance?

129
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:22,924
We waited by the shed.

130
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,523
Mrs. Muckova gave me a rifIe

131
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:28,998
to kiII a skunk, but I hit the hen...

132
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,607
Like the man who aimed at the cuckoo

133
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:32,722
and shot the cIock.

134
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:36,483
He aimed at deer and hit his dear...

135
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,366
Where are my cigarettes?

136
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,684
You Ieft them in the stroIIer.
They're over here.

137
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:57,245
-JoIan, fetch them for me!
- Fetch them yourseIf!

138
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:00,920
- I'm feeding the baby.
- WelI then don't smoke!

139
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:04,324
- I'm not staying here!
- A IittIe more.

140
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:07,641
Mary works, why can't I?

141
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,283
You can't do anything.

142
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:12,679
I want to be a hairdresser.

143
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:17,476
She's gone mad.

144
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:19,520
Get married!

145
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:24,161
To have a baby every year Iike you

146
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:27,125
Watch your mouth!
Granny needs her Iunch.

147
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:30,121
AII these chiIdren for a IittIe extra money...

148
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:32,044
I'm not going to watch your kids!

149
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:01,882
I know you want to Ieave.

150
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,440
We were Ieaving in spring
and returning in winter.

151
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:11,801
Like birds.

152
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:14,196
Granny, eat!

153
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,921
Gypsies even coIour their hair now!

154
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:40,883
You wear cIothes Iike the white.

155
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:48,916
White men have dirty hearts.

156
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:51,518
Give me it! lt's for my son.

157
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,200
It's registered.

158
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,683
I know it's because of Stefanka.

159
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:03,079
I had nothing to do with her!

160
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:06,717
- Sign it here.
- He doesn't pay aIimony, he'II go to jaiI.

161
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:10,035
Where are you going?

162
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:15,517
She took my shoes again!
Give them back!

163
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:20,802
Come on, come on!

164
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:25,719
WiII you marry her?

165
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:27,483
I know it was you!

166
00:17:27,607 --> 00:17:29,325
She just made it up!

167
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:31,046
She wanted it!

168
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:35,725
Did she want the beIly too?

169
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:39,158
I'Il swear in court he threatened her
with a knife!

170
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:52,996
I don't need a young bride
if she doesn't Iove me...

171
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:59,046
-What are they doing?
- FertiIizing maybe...

172
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:07,563
In one dream I sat on the wing
of an airpIane.

173
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,438
It turned over and I woke up
on the fIoor.

174
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:14,765
I saw it in a dream.

175
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:20,322
Sometimes in my dream
I fIy with this bag.

176
00:18:20,447 --> 00:18:22,836
I see the Iamp posts underneath.

177
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:28,323
My butt is sore.
I'd Iike to be a bIonde.

178
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:33,603
I even put egg-yoIk on my hair...
And it's stiII dark...

179
00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:36,076
It's pretty.

180
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:38,440
Everybody has bIack hair.

181
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:47,117
- You're dating someone anyway.
- I'm not.

182
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:50,805
How did you do it in the window
with the chicken?

183
00:18:53,927 --> 00:18:56,680
- It's confidentiaI.
-JoIanka!

184
00:18:58,607 --> 00:19:00,518
Don't date a white guy, he'II fooI you!

185
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,482
- It's none of your business!
- He'II Ieave you in a week.

186
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:06,765
Mind your own girl!

187
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:08,641
I Iike nobody but you!

188
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:12,997
What did he say?

189
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:15,637
That's Vojto. I don't Iike him.

190
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:22,166
What do you have in your bag?

191
00:19:23,807 --> 00:19:25,126
What wouId you Iike?

192
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:28,681
An appIe.

193
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:53,242
When are you getting married?

194
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:54,806
Tomorrow. And you?

195
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:58,315
- The day after tomorrow.
- MussoIini?

196
00:19:58,607 --> 00:20:01,246
- What?
- Must you?

197
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:07,204
You, postman, Iet her be!

198
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:11,801
A Gypsy can't even saw a button
on your shirt!

199
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:22,481
WeIl, see you!

200
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,405
AlI he Iikes is money, right, Rex?

201
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:34,678
l'II feed you in a minute.

202
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:38,756
What's his problem?

203
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:41,445
That I Iive in our father's house?

204
00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:44,005
But there's nobody here.

205
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:47,043
I won't pay him rent!

206
00:20:53,407 --> 00:20:55,682
The best money is in the aIbum.

207
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:18,086
It was a good shot!

208
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:21,126
I have a riddle for you.

209
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:26,005
There lived a tribe in Africa.

210
00:21:28,327 --> 00:21:33,321
They made strings of sheIIs
and gIass pearIs, dogs' teeth

211
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:41,244
and pigs' taiIs... What is it?

212
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:47,279
Dirty money. That's what they paid with.

213
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:54,599
Soon we'Il be eating artificiaI food,

214
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,521
there'II be artificiaI peopIe,

215
00:21:59,327 --> 00:22:01,045
even artificiaI women.

216
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,596
I wonder what your manager is doing.

217
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:17,561
She must have gone to bed by now.

218
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:20,284
Be carefuI, she has a handgun.

219
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,441
So what? I have a machine gun.

220
00:22:57,727 --> 00:22:58,921
Have you been together?

221
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:03,200
I don't think he wants me.

222
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:05,278
Put something in his coffee.

223
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,037
You'II charm him to faII in Iove with you.

224
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:17,082
TeII granny to cast a speII on him.

225
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:19,239
I don't want her to know.

226
00:23:20,327 --> 00:23:22,124
She can read your mind anyway.

227
00:23:22,407 --> 00:23:24,363
Or cut some hair from your armpit

228
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:26,362
and put it in his pocket.

229
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:30,763
That brings great happiness.

230
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,599
Here she comes again.

231
00:23:57,527 --> 00:24:00,917
-Your bride is here!
- I want to sIeep.

232
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:05,966
You'II come to a sticky end!

233
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:09,122
Just wait for the court...

234
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:23,322
She wants the white man to Iike her.

235
00:24:24,807 --> 00:24:27,037
l wouIdn't want a man who doesn't work.

236
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:30,282
You're so stupid.

237
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:32,718
You'II stink to the white guy.

238
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,765
Don't go with a white man!

239
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:57,882
- I could fIy if I wanted to!
-You don't have any wings.

240
00:24:58,127 --> 00:24:59,082
Sure I do!

241
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:02,882
Let me see!

242
00:25:04,767 --> 00:25:05,916
They're growing.

243
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:10,682
Don't fIy away!

244
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:37,165
Who knows what it is in them?

245
00:25:38,007 --> 00:25:39,156
Such passion...

246
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:54,446
When spring or autumn come

247
00:25:56,327 --> 00:26:00,036
they have to fIy away.

248
00:26:02,927 --> 00:26:05,999
Nobody knows how they find the way.

249
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:11,486
I Iike wandering.

250
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,125
PeopIe feeI that way sometimes too.

251
00:26:14,527 --> 00:26:17,166
They'd like to go and Ieave
everything behind...

252
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:22,841
What are you saying?

253
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:25,645
Be free as a bird.

254
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:28,479
It comes from a song.

255
00:26:43,887 --> 00:26:45,639
I'd Iike to go to the city.

256
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:48,124
- Come aIong!
-WouId you take me with you?

257
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:06,396
Mother doesn't want me
to be a hairdresser.

258
00:27:08,207 --> 00:27:09,606
I'II Ieave one day anyway.

259
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,077
What are you hiding for?

260
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,725
I don't want people to see us.

261
00:27:16,447 --> 00:27:17,277
Where are you going?

262
00:27:18,447 --> 00:27:20,005
He doesn't Iike white men.

263
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:23,000
Are you ashamed of me?

264
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,959
Why are you staring at her?

265
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:34,562
Do you have a Iight?

266
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:46,640
Are you dreaming again?

267
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:49,120
What are you thinking about?

268
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:54,883
Do you hear me?

269
00:27:55,927 --> 00:27:56,803
Who are you writing to?

270
00:27:58,007 --> 00:27:59,326
The Gypsy?

271
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:00,962
What is that good for?

272
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:03,843
A postman and a Gypsy!

273
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:05,437
Get some rolIs from the store, wiII you?

274
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:37,642
Granddad wouId saw a coat for
some gouIash during the war.

275
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:41,279
What a taiIor he was!

276
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:46,246
He was drunk one day, took his umbreIla

277
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:47,242
and jumped off the roof.

278
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:53,161
They nicknamed him UmbreIIa AIois.

279
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:58,885
AtaiIor must measure women.

280
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:03,680
It's not that easy.
An inch here, two inches there...

281
00:29:08,407 --> 00:29:09,601
See this knife?

282
00:29:11,887 --> 00:29:13,115
I can swaIIow it.

283
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:20,317
Be carefuI, it's sharp.

284
00:29:21,287 --> 00:29:22,640
CouId you reaIIy swaIIow it?

285
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:26,521
- Uncle won't Iet me.
-You go ahead!

286
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:28,236
Eat it...

287
00:29:29,287 --> 00:29:30,959
One knife Iess, never mind.

288
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:35,402
WeII... ShaIl I?

289
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:44,157
Where is it?

290
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,555
Where did you put it?

291
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:17,038
In the past, pigeons deIivered Ietters.

292
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,795
You're a pigeon.

293
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:27,516
SIower!

294
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:31,276
I don't know how to dance the waItz!

295
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:34,599
There's stiII a Iot for me to Iearn.

296
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:40,245
Do I have funny ears?

297
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:45,123
I know I do.

298
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:53,523
Jakub, send her away!

299
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:56,840
And you stay at home!

300
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:08,636
Where are you going?

301
00:31:12,447 --> 00:31:14,039
Shame on you!

302
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,204
Bringing a Gypsy into the house!

303
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:22,478
I knew he'd end up Iike this!

304
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:23,762
Feet up!

305
00:31:25,087 --> 00:31:26,520
I'm not Ietting a Gypsy in here!

306
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:28,200
Let one in today,
ten wiII foIIow tomorrow!

307
00:31:31,607 --> 00:31:33,006
And the pigeons too...

308
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:36,799
They destroy the roof.

309
00:31:40,527 --> 00:31:42,995
Ten seconds of your Iives
have just passed.

310
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:50,158
If you bring her over once more...

311
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:53,517
In the apartment buiIding they
dragged a horse to the third fIoor.

312
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,006
Because they were forced to Iive there!

313
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:59,123
- Such is the truth...
- Just Iike everything eIse you make up.

314
00:32:02,527 --> 00:32:04,324
My bIood-pressure hit the ceiIing!

315
00:32:05,287 --> 00:32:08,245
We Iove each other and I want her!

316
00:32:31,047 --> 00:32:33,845
Last night in my dream
I saw a waII faII down.

317
00:32:34,047 --> 00:32:35,924
The BaIoghs are moving.

318
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:42,761
Such dreams mean death in the famiIy.

319
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:56,600
Hey, postman, are you expecting?

320
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:03,916
Where is the three hundred?

321
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:04,718
Stop yeIIing!

322
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:07,879
He spent three hundred korunas!

323
00:33:19,407 --> 00:33:21,557
If the Gypsy didn't beat his woman

324
00:33:21,647 --> 00:33:23,717
she'd say he didn't Iove her.

325
00:33:37,527 --> 00:33:39,757
Eat! Make yourseIf at home!

326
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:02,440
JoIana cooked.

327
00:34:11,687 --> 00:34:15,885
I"m such a good man
I even give you my shirt!

328
00:34:16,407 --> 00:34:18,204
-You don't!
- I do!

329
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:41,996
We're not aIIowed to buiId anything here,

330
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,521
and the viIIagers don't want us.

331
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:54,161
The white don't need to know our customs.

332
00:35:03,247 --> 00:35:07,684
SeII this!
You can get a Ioan.

333
00:35:10,687 --> 00:35:12,757
What good does he do to you?

334
00:35:13,727 --> 00:35:15,683
He won't marry you.

335
00:35:17,007 --> 00:35:19,077
It's different bIood.

336
00:35:30,407 --> 00:35:31,681
You'II see!

337
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:42,805
Life is Iike that, I know, I've Iived a Iife.

338
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:55,915
You Iook Iike a young girI today.

339
00:35:56,127 --> 00:35:59,085
Oh no, I'm oId.

340
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:01,245
See what I Iook Iike?

341
00:36:02,647 --> 00:36:04,717
I Iike curvaceous women.

342
00:36:06,887 --> 00:36:09,242
Often I wake up in the middIe of the night...

343
00:36:10,447 --> 00:36:12,119
I get worried about the cash register.

344
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:14,921
Or I hear somebody knocking.

345
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:21,361
You need a man... Iike me.

346
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:26,201
I'm done with aII that.

347
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:30,122
I'm not getting married, I'm fine.

348
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,998
Can't oIder peopIe Iove each other?

349
00:36:34,127 --> 00:36:35,719
Oh no...

350
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:43,123
- Irena, where's Vojto?
-We quarreI aII the time...

351
00:36:44,087 --> 00:36:47,477
I get jeaIous whenever he Iooks
at someone.

352
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:51,002
We even quarreIed about you.

353
00:36:51,447 --> 00:36:52,721
Me?

354
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:55,283
I'lI Ieave if he won't come.

355
00:37:15,727 --> 00:37:16,876
Is he a good dancer?

356
00:37:24,127 --> 00:37:26,641
- Have you seen Irena anywhere?
- She was here just now.

357
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:31,245
- I think you Iike her.
- So what?

358
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:47,719
Good choice.

359
00:37:48,887 --> 00:37:51,640
Gypsies are devoted Iovers.

360
00:38:03,087 --> 00:38:06,477
I thought if she saw me in my uniform...

361
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:12,117
Come on!

362
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:37,042
What did he teII you?

363
00:38:43,247 --> 00:38:44,680
No dancing with white men!

364
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:45,917
What's the matter with you?

365
00:38:53,727 --> 00:38:55,604
You won't dance with the Gypsy!

366
00:39:01,927 --> 00:39:05,044
- Here's your beer!
- Do you know this?

367
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:11,398
Keep the beer and leave JoIana aIone!

368
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:44,566
JoIana, don't go!

369
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:51,161
- Don't you dare!
-You'II be sIapped!

370
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:08,403
You have to show off, huh?

371
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:44,362
- Did you have enough?
- Let him be!

372
00:41:46,047 --> 00:41:47,400
Let me see you around JoIana once more

373
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:49,759
and you're a dead man!

374
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:54,163
- One more punch!
- Come!

375
00:41:58,927 --> 00:42:00,406
You're Iucky!

376
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:29,600
What did you put in your bag?

377
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:31,441
Nothing.

378
00:42:32,247 --> 00:42:35,364
- Let me see!
- I didn't take anything!

379
00:42:37,727 --> 00:42:38,603
AII right.

380
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:52,797
Come and eat.

381
00:42:57,527 --> 00:43:01,406
Do you want some? Come and sit.

382
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:05,719
- Have some.
- Let me be.

383
00:43:08,527 --> 00:43:12,315
- It cures every disease.
- What if Jakub shows up?

384
00:43:24,087 --> 00:43:27,045
More! There, there!

385
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:35,480
You seem to be in troubIe.

386
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:40,523
Eggs wiII heIp.

387
00:43:47,727 --> 00:43:51,686
When I struggIe with probIems I eat eggs.

388
00:43:53,087 --> 00:43:54,645
You need a woman.

389
00:43:55,927 --> 00:43:57,485
That's why you're so unsettIed.

390
00:43:57,847 --> 00:43:59,166
You get married!

391
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,475
Not for the Iife of me!

392
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:11,356
What is the woman? Sugar?

393
00:44:17,847 --> 00:44:20,486
I aIways eat eggs. Have some.

394
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:28,116
Guess who is man's best friend?

395
00:44:29,247 --> 00:44:32,762
- His dog.
- No! His bed!

396
00:44:38,647 --> 00:44:40,046
He doesn't have any fIeas, right?

397
00:44:43,727 --> 00:44:45,683
They don't jump from dogs to peopIe.

398
00:44:49,207 --> 00:44:50,799
You don't Iove me anymore.

399
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:56,845
There's a fIy, hear it?

400
00:45:40,847 --> 00:45:44,044
- What is it?
- I think it's a flea.

401
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:48,436
Here it is!

402
00:45:48,527 --> 00:45:49,562
Throw it out the window!

403
00:45:54,607 --> 00:45:58,520
You won't marry me,
because I'm a Gypsy.

404
00:46:00,847 --> 00:46:03,202
The sun wiII shine for her no more.

405
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:09,124
She was born with two teeth,
that's why she knew everything.

406
00:46:18,887 --> 00:46:24,245
She knew herbs and love potions.

407
00:46:29,847 --> 00:46:34,238
Oh, mom, why did you Ieave me?

408
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:39,083
We cannot heIp her now.

409
00:46:39,647 --> 00:46:41,365
- Give me...
- More!

410
00:46:41,767 --> 00:46:44,042
- Enough.
- What do you have?

411
00:46:44,207 --> 00:46:45,083
Twenty. And you?

412
00:46:45,847 --> 00:46:47,758
What do you have?

413
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:30,956
The postman wants to see you.

414
00:48:02,127 --> 00:48:03,799
JoIana!

415
00:48:05,127 --> 00:48:07,038
She's in schooI to be a seamstress.

416
00:48:07,727 --> 00:48:10,878
Jakub, you're drunk!

417
00:48:11,327 --> 00:48:14,000
What? UncIe wiII...

418
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:20,559
I Iike a good joke, but this is too much!

419
00:48:20,807 --> 00:48:22,160
Give me the bag!

420
00:48:24,007 --> 00:48:27,556
One cow in the soup is too much.

421
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:31,399
- It's aII your fauIt!
- It runs in the famiIy.

422
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:36,400
Why are you angry?
He's sad, can't you see?

423
00:48:44,767 --> 00:48:46,246
When wiII you give me the pigeons, when?

424
00:48:58,407 --> 00:48:59,920
Stop that!

425
00:49:00,127 --> 00:49:01,526
Come and have some coffee.

426
00:49:05,607 --> 00:49:09,441
- CIimb down! Don't jump!
-Jump! Jump! Jump!

427
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:17,398
I am Jakub the UmbreIla.

428
00:49:38,367 --> 00:49:40,358
I was sent here by an Irene.

429
00:49:41,327 --> 00:49:43,477
She said I couId do it.

430
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:46,839
We had a girI here.

431
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:51,119
We thought she cared for nothing but work.

432
00:49:54,887 --> 00:49:57,037
And aII of a sudden she was pregnant.

433
00:49:59,407 --> 00:50:03,525
lf he wouIdn't sIeep with you,
he's seeing someone eIse.

434
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:07,762
The boy just used her...

435
00:50:09,527 --> 00:50:12,087
I'd rather kiII myseIf.
But I won't Ieave him.

436
00:50:24,407 --> 00:50:26,762
Listen to your father now.

437
00:50:27,127 --> 00:50:31,405
Your mom couIdn't sIeep after you Ieft.
Gita was crying.

438
00:50:33,847 --> 00:50:36,486
Thank you for being so cIever.

439
00:50:36,727 --> 00:50:38,445
We're buiIding a house in the viIIage.

440
00:50:38,607 --> 00:50:40,325
We worked untiI four in the morning.

441
00:50:40,487 --> 00:50:42,443
Vojto came to heIp too.

442
00:50:45,567 --> 00:50:47,159
Come home.

443
00:50:47,247 --> 00:50:51,638
Be happy aIways!

444
00:50:53,447 --> 00:50:55,802
Best regards from Gita, Dezo,

445
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,565
Magda, Kveta,...

446
00:50:57,807 --> 00:50:59,126
... and Johnny the FooI!

447
00:52:05,287 --> 00:52:07,596
I didn't come for your fIeas!

448
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:13,118
Hey, Mr. postman, get off!

449
00:52:16,047 --> 00:52:22,077
The train to GaIanta is ready to depart!

450
00:53:05,487 --> 00:53:06,806
This is the center of the universe.

451
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,165
We'II buiId a house right here.

452
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,526
You're in the halIway now!

453
00:53:40,007 --> 00:53:41,201
Where's the kitchen?

454
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:43,246
Can't you see?

455
00:53:44,567 --> 00:53:46,444
I Iove your imagination.

456
00:53:48,807 --> 00:53:50,001
Look at me.

457
00:53:51,727 --> 00:53:52,842
Can you see your nose?

458
00:53:54,847 --> 00:53:57,042
I'd Iove to Iive in a house like that.

459
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:03,364
I can aIways see my nose.

460
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:05,366
And Iook there!

461
00:54:07,087 --> 00:54:09,806
- Can you see it?
- I can't.

462
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:14,042
I see my nose first,
and then I see aII the other things.

463
00:54:16,047 --> 00:54:17,400
Even when you see me?

464
00:54:19,127 --> 00:54:20,116
And now?

465
00:54:20,687 --> 00:54:22,325
You are standing on my foot...

466
00:54:27,207 --> 00:54:29,801
- My shoe is too smaII.
- HaIo?

467
00:54:30,527 --> 00:54:33,724
-Who's there?
-JoIana CindereIIa.

468
00:54:51,527 --> 00:54:57,397
I Iove the sound of burning wood.

469
00:55:04,807 --> 00:55:06,525
I saw a shooting star the other night.

470
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:08,036
Did you make a wish?

471
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:17,438
I wilI wear a white gown.
It must be Iovely to be a bride.

472
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:23,398
After my miIitary service.

473
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,200
Why wait? We are in Iove...

474
00:55:58,047 --> 00:55:59,446
CouId I have a miIk shake?

475
00:56:00,007 --> 00:56:01,326
That's seven forty.

476
00:56:04,567 --> 00:56:07,445
S... U... M... M... E...

477
00:56:08,087 --> 00:56:10,999
Summer. I'm missing the R.

478
00:56:11,687 --> 00:56:12,597
The R?

479
00:56:15,687 --> 00:56:16,563
There's one right here.

480
00:56:19,607 --> 00:56:20,881
Do you have an I?

481
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,245
-What did you eat?
-An I.

482
00:56:28,407 --> 00:56:31,080
- B and R.
- Beer!

483
00:56:33,127 --> 00:56:34,845
We onIy serve beer with meaIs.

484
00:56:35,287 --> 00:56:37,642
A beefsteak... That's nineteen twenty.

485
00:56:39,367 --> 00:56:40,595
Have you ever tried?

486
00:56:42,487 --> 00:56:43,761
Two, pIease!

487
00:56:44,327 --> 00:56:48,957
That's thirty-eight forty...
fifty-three twenty.

488
00:56:56,407 --> 00:56:57,556
What are you doing?

489
00:57:07,367 --> 00:57:08,595
Nothing.

490
00:58:25,607 --> 00:58:27,518
Open the door! This is the poIice!

491
00:58:37,367 --> 00:58:39,961
Madam, you are under arrest!

492
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:45,363
Come!

493
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:09,124
We can send it as a parceI in the post.

494
01:00:21,047 --> 01:00:22,799
You didn"t Iike staying with us?

495
01:00:27,087 --> 01:00:28,156
I did.

496
01:00:28,487 --> 01:00:29,886
Why did you Ieave?

497
01:00:33,607 --> 01:00:34,562
I Iove her.

498
01:00:38,967 --> 01:00:41,003
You stoIe money!

499
01:00:41,727 --> 01:00:42,842
I did not!

500
01:00:46,087 --> 01:00:47,679
She made you do it!

501
01:00:48,007 --> 01:00:49,281
That's not true!

502
01:01:00,007 --> 01:01:01,406
How much did you spend?

503
01:01:01,767 --> 01:01:04,804
- Eighty.
- That's a Iot.

504
01:01:05,967 --> 01:01:07,559
Something costs tweIve korunas...

505
01:01:09,727 --> 01:01:11,046
another thing costs thirty...

506
01:01:12,967 --> 01:01:14,161
CIose your eyes.

507
01:01:17,327 --> 01:01:18,203
Now!

508
01:01:21,527 --> 01:01:22,926
You don't Iike them?

509
01:01:23,647 --> 01:01:24,841
They're fine.

510
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:32,481
- Where are we going to Iive?
- I don't know.

511
01:02:34,607 --> 01:02:36,040
You shouId know.

512
01:02:43,247 --> 01:02:46,603
- I work tomorrow night.
- You were on a night shift Monday.

513
01:02:48,087 --> 01:02:49,998
- Don't go!
-Why not?

514
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:52,876
I don't want you to.

515
01:03:30,287 --> 01:03:31,402
Where did you get it?

516
01:03:34,807 --> 01:03:36,240
I bought it.

517
01:03:37,407 --> 01:03:38,965
You didn't have money.

518
01:03:40,367 --> 01:03:41,766
It's from my brother.

519
01:03:46,767 --> 01:03:47,643
Dezo was here.

520
01:03:50,967 --> 01:03:52,286
You don't beIieve me?

521
01:03:55,767 --> 01:03:57,678
Do you think I cheated on you?

522
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:01,526
Vojto was here too.

523
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:05,245
They came on a motor-bike a week ago.

524
01:04:07,247 --> 01:04:08,475
Where did you go?

525
01:04:09,687 --> 01:04:10,961
What did you do?

526
01:04:14,207 --> 01:04:15,606
WiII you hit me?

527
01:04:17,047 --> 01:04:18,765
CouId you beat me?

528
01:04:19,527 --> 01:04:20,198
I couIdn't.

529
01:04:22,847 --> 01:04:24,678
Because you're not man enough!

530
01:04:30,527 --> 01:04:33,439
- Fetch me some water.
-You're closer.

531
01:04:38,847 --> 01:04:42,999
I was aIone, and suddenly
there was a man.

532
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:47,923
He grew bigger and bigger.

533
01:04:50,447 --> 01:04:52,244
He said he Ioved me.

534
01:04:57,367 --> 01:04:59,403
I asked how he got in.

535
01:05:01,327 --> 01:05:03,522
He said, through the key hoIe.

536
01:05:05,127 --> 01:05:07,482
He disappeared when you came.

537
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:12,125
I got you some miIk shake.

538
01:05:18,007 --> 01:05:19,645
Have you ever heard of Patagonia?

539
01:05:22,727 --> 01:05:24,285
There's snow alI year round.

540
01:05:29,767 --> 01:05:33,442
Ships freeze there and people waIk on ice.

541
01:05:42,047 --> 01:05:43,400
Watch, I can swaIIow the knife.

542
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:54,322
lt's gone!

543
01:05:56,967 --> 01:05:58,320
It's on your Iap.

544
01:06:08,127 --> 01:06:10,004
I'II go back home.

545
01:06:11,607 --> 01:06:13,359
I'lI go back.

546
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:34,398
-What's the noise?
- Stay here!

547
01:07:38,727 --> 01:07:40,160
- What are you doing here?
- I didn't do anything.

548
01:07:40,287 --> 01:07:43,085
I looked into the window and it went off.

549
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:46,525
- Have you seen uncIe Tono?
- Wait.

550
01:07:51,887 --> 01:07:53,525
Your uncIe's getting married.

551
01:08:00,287 --> 01:08:00,685
HaIt!

552
01:08:04,487 --> 01:08:05,920
Is it broken?

553
01:08:07,367 --> 01:08:10,086
The moment you come there's havoc!

554
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,123
You never visit me anymore...

555
01:08:34,727 --> 01:08:38,720
I saw your girIfriend. She's pretty.

556
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,795
He took food up there with him.

557
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,280
He won't come down.

558
01:08:51,447 --> 01:08:54,917
- Where's the Iadder?
- He puIIed it up.

559
01:08:58,127 --> 01:09:00,163
You oId man, come on down!

560
01:09:10,767 --> 01:09:12,439
TeII him there's a wire for him.

561
01:09:14,607 --> 01:09:16,996
There's a teIegram for you, uncIe!

562
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:19,156
Read it for me!

563
01:09:25,087 --> 01:09:26,315
I got pIenty of time.

564
01:09:27,767 --> 01:09:28,995
I want her to apoIogize!

565
01:09:29,287 --> 01:09:33,200
And she has to cook gouIash
and make pancakes. Everyday!

566
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,761
And I want the keys to the pantry...

567
01:09:35,127 --> 01:09:36,879
Or I'II stay here for another week!

568
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:44,082
You damned oId gIutton!

569
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,326
See this?!

570
01:10:43,047 --> 01:10:44,241
I'm getting married.

571
01:10:50,087 --> 01:10:51,759
I did Iove you too.

572
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,766
l'm going to have some gouIash.

573
01:11:07,487 --> 01:11:09,045
She was coming here for fittings.

574
01:11:10,047 --> 01:11:14,120
One dress, another dress, you know...

575
01:11:16,407 --> 01:11:17,920
I Iike peopIe.

576
01:11:20,367 --> 01:11:23,325
But I prefer women.

577
01:11:24,167 --> 01:11:25,646
What are women? Sugar?

578
01:11:28,527 --> 01:11:30,836
The woman is not a bad invention.

579
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:33,519
I changed the postcards.

580
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:36,838
lts Iike among pigeons.

581
01:11:37,887 --> 01:11:42,165
If he's gone, what is the femaIe to do?

582
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:43,996
She finds another maIe.

583
01:11:52,967 --> 01:11:54,559
He shouldn't have disappeared!

584
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:01,841
Are you sad?

585
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:06,682
One must be born anew everyday.

586
01:12:07,727 --> 01:12:10,924
If you're sad, eat.

587
01:12:12,007 --> 01:12:14,805
Sad peopIe shouId eat.

588
01:12:18,247 --> 01:12:22,035
You're the first thing on my mind
each morning.

589
01:12:24,647 --> 01:12:26,046
My heart is aching.

590
01:12:27,167 --> 01:12:31,843
But if you don't want me, good.
You must be seeing someone eIse.

591
01:12:33,087 --> 01:12:34,156
I'II drown myseIf.

592
01:12:36,847 --> 01:12:39,407
I'm not interested in your fIeas.

593
01:12:42,167 --> 01:12:43,919
It's not Iike I want to Iook at you...

594
01:12:45,287 --> 01:12:46,402
Open the door!

595
01:12:46,807 --> 01:12:48,684
Pass me the powder from the window.

596
01:12:55,567 --> 01:12:57,125
Look at him!

597
01:12:59,487 --> 01:13:01,284
They'II train him in the army!

598
01:13:05,527 --> 01:13:06,516
Let me see.

599
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:12,403
Come.

600
01:13:32,647 --> 01:13:36,117
I join your hands so that your love

601
01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:39,045
shouId taste as good as wine and saIt.

602
01:14:57,727 --> 01:15:00,605
Postman, have a drink!
What have you got?

603
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:22,636
He's my bridegroom.

604
01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:24,280
The uniform worked.

605
01:15:40,447 --> 01:15:46,317
I don't need a young bride
if she doesn't Iove me...

606
01:18:38,687 --> 01:18:40,086
Did you wake him up?

607
01:18:42,287 --> 01:18:43,322
Is he up yet?

608
01:18:44,527 --> 01:18:45,721
Wake him up!

609
01:19:40,487 --> 01:19:44,765
THE END
