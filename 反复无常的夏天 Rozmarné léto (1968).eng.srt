1
01:38:02,682 --> 08:28:02,510
THIS CHURCH WAS AT ONE TIME THE OBJECT
OF MUCH ABUSE HAVING BEEN BUILT BY

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,955


3
01:37:02,680 --> 08:28:02,510
A CO XCOMB CHEEKY ENOUGH TO ALTER
THE GROUND PLAN CONTRARY TO THE RULE.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,955


5
01:50:02,670 --> 08:28:02,515
WE WERE ACQU AINTED WITH THAT MASTER
BUILDER AND WE LIKED HIM WELL,

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,955


7
01:54:02,664 --> 09:04:02,510
EVEN INF HE WAS SOME WHAT DISSOLUTE.

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,309


10
03:52:02,547 --> 09:04:02,510
THE CAPRICIOUS SUMMER

11
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,316


12
02:38:02,619 --> 09:04:02,510
This is an unfortunate summer indeed.

13
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,155


14
02:51:02,608 --> 08:28:02,516
Shouldn t the month of June at least
permit us to attend

15
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,152


16
03:41:02,556 --> 09:04:02,510
to our health and cleanness?

17
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,919


18
03:34:02,565 --> 08:28:02,510
Hey, mister!
Get down from the broomatick

19
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,639


20
04:45:02,493 --> 09:04:02,516
I see you are riding.

21
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,918


22
02:55:02,604 --> 08:28:02,516
Where did you learn such manners?
- Pray do not cell me indecent.

23
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,749


24
02:47:02,612 --> 08:28:02,510
I removed my trousers
because the skin too wants to brathe.

25
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,110


26
04:16:02,526 --> 08:28:02,516
I was taught and I follow
the rules of hygiene.

27
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,113


28
04:01:02,536 --> 09:04:02,516
For the benefit of my body.

29
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,711


30
03:08:02,592 --> 09:04:02,516
Being enthusiastic for the present.

31
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,313


32
03:12:02,587 --> 09:04:02,516
You are neglecting things eternal.

33
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,915


34
03:33:02,566 --> 08:28:02,516
The book I laid down
is near enough to be remindful

35
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,955


36
04:16:02,522 --> 08:28:02,516
of what duration means.
It is 2000 years old!

37
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,159


38
03:13:02,586 --> 09:04:02,516
Pay attention to my words, major.

39
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,752


40
03:10:02,588 --> 08:28:02,510
The major has not read your book
an will never read it.

41
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,751


42
04:13:02,525 --> 09:04:02,510
Even if it were older still.

43
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,395


44
03:42:02,557 --> 08:28:02,510
Should he believe the bray
of old asses sounded better?

45
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,677


46
03:45:02,552 --> 08:28:02,516
He has come to fish
and you scare the fish away.

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,319


48
06:13:02,404 --> 09:04:02,510
Oh no.

49
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,960


50
02:41:02,617 --> 09:04:02,510
I have come to like these discussions.

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,434


52
02:37:02,621 --> 08:28:02,510
Although I do not find them very noble,
I admit them.

53
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,509


54
03:56:02,542 --> 09:04:02,516
As a faint reflex of passion.

55
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,960


56
03:34:02,565 --> 08:28:02,516
What can be more magnificent
than an ever blue sky

57
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,555


58
03:11:02,588 --> 09:04:02,516
and an ever burning red passion?

59
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,712


60
03:19:02,580 --> 09:04:02,516
I am doubtful about the blue sky.

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,195


62
03:25:02,572 --> 09:04:02,516
This June is not up to the mark.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,357


64
03:35:02,564 --> 08:28:02,516
Why are you holding back?
As if do not moan hours long?

65
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,190


66
04:04:02,535 --> 08:28:02,516
Being poor I cannot afford
to expres my indignation.

67
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,756


68
03:56:02,543 --> 09:04:02,515
Yet, I feel inclined to curse.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,949


70
03:09:02,591 --> 08:28:02,516
But for your propensity to wrangle
I could be of some help

71
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,437


72
03:48:02,552 --> 08:28:02,516
but you always want to have
the last say.

73
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,951


74
04:04:02,536 --> 08:28:02,510
Better to have the last say
than the last blow...

75
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,958


76
04:25:02,513 --> 09:04:02,516
Oh, you are never idle!

77
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,434


78
02:42:02,617 --> 08:28:02,510
We are discoursing on abstract things
with the canon.

79
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,435


80
03:23:02,577 --> 09:04:02,516
I thing you are talking nonsense

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,752


82
02:36:02,622 --> 09:04:02,516
and shouting as if money was at stake.

83
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,870


84
04:09:02,527 --> 08:28:02,516
I have had to listen
to my husband s prating

85
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,714


86
02:41:02,617 --> 09:04:02,510
ever since I married him at seventeen.

87
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,916


88
02:59:02,600 --> 08:28:02,516
For you should know
I was too young when I got married.

89
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,235


90
03:08:02,591 --> 09:04:02,510
I could have chosen better fellows

91
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,756


92
02:40:02,619 --> 08:27:02,516
if Antonín had not thrashed my suitors
got hold of my keys

93
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,072


94
02:58:02,601 --> 08:28:02,516
and plagued me
until marriage became unavoidable.

95
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,755


96
03:42:02,556 --> 08:28:02,510
How can I, major, under such
circumstances

97
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,751


98
02:29:02,628 --> 08:28:02,516
heed your kings
the canon s books and my own health?

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,037


100
02:33:02,627 --> 08:27:02,510
It's true, Antonín was very much in love
and of excellent health.

101
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,275


102
04:16:02,524 --> 08:28:02,516
I bet he gave the fellows
a good hidding.

103
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,273


104
03:05:02,595 --> 08:28:02,516
My husband is an unparalelled ass
come sir, let me ferry you.

105
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,038


106
03:28:02,569 --> 09:04:02,514
Those two won t hear a word...

107
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,789


108
03:22:02,574 --> 08:28:02,516
I am ready to bet
they are talking about fire-arms.

109
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,837


110
03:16:02,584 --> 08:27:02,516
You never met the organist, abbé
who used to pinch my hip...

111
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,195


112
03:17:02,580 --> 09:04:02,516
singing merrily at the same time.

113
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,951


114
02:52:02,606 --> 08:28:02,515
I am sure you are not lagging behind
him - in inventiveness,

115
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,669


116
04:37:02,501 --> 08:28:02,516
being much travelled
and highly educated.

117
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,876


118
03:15:02,582 --> 08:28:02,516
The swimming master, you and I
are old enough not to be tempted

119
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,149


120
03:07:02,590 --> 09:04:02,516
to jump over a neighbour s fence.

121
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,954


122
04:27:02,511 --> 08:28:02,510
The canon is a pervert
beware of him.

123
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,518


124
03:03:02,594 --> 09:04:02,516
Oh, this has nothing to do with me.

125
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,359


126
04:14:02,524 --> 09:04:02,516
You are uncanny, major.

127
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,951


128
03:46:02,553 --> 08:28:02,516
Always astraddle, perspiring
casting lightening-glances

129
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,760


130
03:27:02,573 --> 08:28:02,516
you remind me of a sergeant
I used to know rather intimately

131
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,713


132
04:52:02,485 --> 08:28:02,510
when I was young.
Lend me a hand!

133
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,348


134
02:12:02,645 --> 09:04:02,516
That sergeant was as quarrelsome as you.

135
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,593


136
03:21:02,578 --> 08:28:02,510
I offered him everything suitable
to curb his vehemence.

137
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,354


138
04:12:02,526 --> 08:28:02,516
Still, he twisted buttons
in his impatient fingers...

139
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,431


140
03:48:02,550 --> 09:04:02,510
and drank bottle after bottle.

141
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,632


142
03:04:02,592 --> 08:28:02,516
He was in the army-service corps
wearing red breaches, not like you

143
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,155


144
04:48:02,490 --> 09:04:02,516
an old artilleryman.

145
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,909


146
03:17:02,583 --> 08:28:02,510
Regiments wearing red breaches
were recruited form farm hands.

147
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,079


148
03:18:02,580 --> 08:28:02,516
Oh, indeed?
I have never heard such opinion.

149
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,676


150
03:30:02,566 --> 08:28:02,516
Those fellows,
were the darlings of our street.

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,515


152
02:26:02,633 --> 08:28:02,516
Your husband to whom you are indepted
for having taken you out

153
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,955


154
02:55:02,604 --> 08:28:02,516
of a hideous suburb
was neither a wagoner nor a gunner

155
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,719


156
05:31:02,448 --> 09:04:02,516
but a sapper.

157
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,155


158
05:14:02,464 --> 09:04:02,514
Don t I know it!

159
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,712


160
03:36:02,561 --> 08:28:02,516
Hint at anything else
and the master will baste you.

161
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,356


162
03:35:02,563 --> 08:28:02,516
Only fools neglect the present
living in the past.

163
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,356


164
04:41:02,498 --> 09:04:02,510
Let us eat nad drink!

165
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,556


166
03:29:02,570 --> 08:28:02,516
Give me fat cheese, venison
birds, lambs, all that is brought

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,355


168
03:18:02,579 --> 09:04:02,516
forth alive or hetched from eggs.

169
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,954


170
03:58:02,540 --> 09:04:02,516
Give me fish and the slugs

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,753


172
03:31:02,567 --> 09:04:02,510
favoured in civilized countrics.

173
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,513


174
03:44:02,553 --> 08:28:02,516
Give me food
the Earth has revolved again

175
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,915


176
04:46:02,492 --> 09:04:02,510
and it is time to eat.

177
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,555


178
03:45:02,553 --> 08:28:02,516
Have you become a windbag
or a glutton, major?

179
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,918


180
03:59:02,538 --> 08:28:02,516
Showing off with you teeth
or your tongue?

181
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,075


182
03:12:02,585 --> 09:04:02,516
Too much talk makes me uneasy.

183
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,271


184
04:24:02,514 --> 08:28:02,516
Uneasy?
We have hardly begun!

185
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,393


186
04:08:02,531 --> 08:28:02,516
You follow a bad regimen
with too much thinking.

187
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,990


188
03:10:02,586 --> 08:28:02,516
Even while eating
which is another form of gluttony.

189
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,358


190
02:48:02,612 --> 09:04:02,516
Do you want to start another quarrel?

191
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,596


192
03:15:02,582 --> 09:04:02,516
Only because of your bad habits.

193
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,793


194
03:28:02,573 --> 08:28:02,516
If I stuck up to my cars in water
you would pull me out.

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,516


196
03:32:02,567 --> 08:28:02,510
Are you not drowning in errors
more fatal than water?

197
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,359


198
04:32:02,508 --> 09:04:02,516
Where is the vinegar?

199
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,550


200
05:51:02,427 --> 09:04:02,510
And salt...

201
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,233


202
03:31:02,568 --> 08:28:02,510
Remember how we used to put
salt on our toast?

203
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,630


204
06:24:02,394 --> 09:04:02,510
Alas!

205
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,955


206
03:18:02,580 --> 09:04:02,516
I remember the Italian campaign.

207
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,072


208
03:02:02,597 --> 09:04:02,516
Why was the first Piave battle lost?

209
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,232


210
03:05:02,593 --> 08:28:02,510
The army was short of mugs.
So that we drank wine from hands.

211
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,037


212
02:53:02,605 --> 08:28:02,516
The soldiers had to punch the casks
with their bayonets

213
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,029


214
03:20:02,577 --> 08:28:02,510
and several regiments
were drowned in wine in cellars.

215
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,036


216
03:10:02,587 --> 08:28:02,510
Much wine was wasted that way
wine which would otherwise have

217
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,030


218
03:25:02,572 --> 09:04:02,516
stimulated thir waning courage.

219
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,351


220
04:00:02,539 --> 08:28:02,516
Show your courage, major
by lifting a quintal.

221
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,476


222
03:03:02,593 --> 08:28:02,516
I could recite some verses
which are immortal though dealing

223
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,558


224
04:06:02,535 --> 08:28:02,516
neither with slaughter nor
weight-lifting.

225
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,433


226
03:29:02,569 --> 09:04:02,516
Do not repeat bookish twaddle!

227
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,114


228
02:59:02,600 --> 08:28:02,516
Silence!
I shall answer youwith this weapon.

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,434


230
03:55:02,543 --> 09:03:02,510
The abbé will die from fear!

231
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,237


232
04:17:02,520 --> 08:28:02,516
All right, I have means
to take you down a peg.

233
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,913


234
05:02:02,477 --> 09:04:02,516
Valour burnt high

235
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,638


236
03:22:02,575 --> 09:04:02,516
Though the arms grew weaker...

237
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,915


238
03:11:02,587 --> 09:04:02,516
To blazes with your book of odes!

239
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,839


240
03:55:02,543 --> 08:28:02,516
And by sword and spear
Men died on the ramparts...

241
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,475


242
04:30:02,508 --> 08:28:02,516
The finger gnawing at
an unintelligible line...

243
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,870


244
02:45:02,612 --> 09:04:02,515
Still, those who died were the victors.

245
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,871


246
04:13:02,526 --> 08:28:02,510
Go hang, you interpreter
of shortwinded lines

247
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,951


248
03:58:02,541 --> 09:04:02,516
limping according to rules!

249
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,072


250
02:56:02,603 --> 09:04:02,516
Their life alone took the cunning foe

251
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,518


252
02:58:02,601 --> 08:28:02,516
And they were crowned with eternal
glory.

253
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,560


254
04:39:02,500 --> 09:04:02,516
Enter unhesitatingly!

255
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,752


256
04:08:02,530 --> 08:27:02,510
The abbé and the major
found the water warmish.

257
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,872


258
03:22:02,575 --> 08:28:02,510
Should you be short of anything
shout and I shall be in time...

259
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,553


260
04:12:02,528 --> 08:28:02,516
My husband may be silly
but he knows his rights

261
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,153


262
04:11:02,527 --> 09:04:02,516
and how to protect them.

263
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,074


264
03:31:02,568 --> 08:28:02,516
If he did not, he would be more
than simply... Antonín.

265
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,755


266
02:38:02,621 --> 09:03:02,515
Yes, Antonín - because I am Katherine.

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,037


268
03:35:02,565 --> 08:28:02,516
You have acquired some logic
which is disarming.

269
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,916


270
03:26:02,574 --> 08:28:02,510
I am going to leave
because some of these females

271
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,390


272
04:46:02,492 --> 08:28:02,516
always try to drown
in sight of us.

273
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,916


274
03:05:02,592 --> 08:28:02,516
Be smart in case of need
and cauticus if they are not of age.

275
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,592


276
03:38:02,559 --> 08:28:02,516
Being a stalwart man of fifty
you are welcome here, major.

277
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,354


278
04:02:02,537 --> 08:28:02,516
Do you want these women
to go away and leave

279
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,792


280
03:09:02,590 --> 09:04:02,516
my swimming-bath unfrequented?

281
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,036


282
04:45:02,493 --> 09:04:02,510
This would ruin me!

283
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,036


284
04:15:02,525 --> 08:28:02,510
You seem to be too sure
of our tolerance.

285
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,276


286
02:40:02,618 --> 09:04:02,516
All commanders are naturally tolerant!

287
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,553


288
03:40:02,557 --> 08:28:02,516
I am Ernie, the conjurer
and, being sensitive to cold...

289
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,435


290
03:33:02,565 --> 08:28:02,516
The clear sky spells a hot day.
Undress, gentlemen!

291
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,909


292
03:21:02,577 --> 08:28:02,516
Is it you, sir
who are in everybody s mouth?

293
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,472


294
03:26:02,572 --> 08:28:02,510
The fire-eater said to have lived
in Paris

295
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,118


296
03:30:02,568 --> 09:04:02,510
who has arrived from Holland?

297
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,113


298
04:57:02,481 --> 09:04:02,516
I was everywhere.

299
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,117


300
04:52:02,486 --> 09:04:02,516
Like all magicians!

301
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,673


302
04:19:02,518 --> 09:04:02,516
Chaps munching glass.

303
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,750


304
03:04:02,594 --> 09:04:02,516
Producing wigs from their sleeves.

305
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,752


306
04:14:02,525 --> 08:28:02,516
Self confident in spite of
a misshapen chest.

307
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,360


308
03:11:02,589 --> 08:28:02,510
He seems dressed for some other
occasion.

309
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,519


310
04:57:02,481 --> 09:04:02,516
Too extravagant...

311
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,236


312
03:58:02,541 --> 09:04:02,516
He is showing all his limbs

313
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,956


314
05:03:02,476 --> 09:04:02,516
in his pink tights.

315
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,470


316
03:42:02,557 --> 09:04:02,516
Pink is the colour of piglings.

317
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,113


318
03:59:02,540 --> 08:28:02,516
If pink is the colour of pigs
the scientists grey

319
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,356


320
04:44:02,495 --> 09:04:02,510
is the colour of rats.

321
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,673


322
03:43:02,555 --> 09:04:02,516
This is a capricious summer.

323
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,436


324
03:51:02,547 --> 08:28:02,516
It was raining yesterday
and it may be raining today.

325
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,640


326
03:35:02,564 --> 09:04:02,516
Is Dutch weather equally bad?

327
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,433


328
05:29:02,450 --> 09:04:02,510
A little better.

329
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,190


330
03:16:02,584 --> 09:04:02,516
But the sundays are meantly wet.

331
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,758


332
03:44:02,555 --> 08:28:02,516
I am practised in clever feats
which, though physical

333
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,355


334
04:52:02,486 --> 09:04:02,510
are mental as well.

335
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,752


336
03:06:02,592 --> 08:28:02,516
I make things vanish from sight
imperceptibly, by a sleight of hand

337
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,474


338
03:29:02,569 --> 08:28:02,516
the cutcome of much thinkings
and long deliberation.

339
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,389


340
03:44:02,556 --> 09:04:02,516
Will you tell me the time, sir?

341
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,600


342
02:14:02,645 --> 08:28:02,516
I feel something like a chill
between the two hemispheres of my brain.

343
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,359


344
03:21:02,578 --> 09:04:02,516
I hear a ringing as of Easte-bells

345
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,189


346
03:37:02,561 --> 08:28:02,516
and it is the ticking of a watch
within my skull.

347
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,073


348
03:09:02,590 --> 09:04:02,516
This watch was inside your head?

349
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,709


350
02:55:02,603 --> 09:04:02,510
Your artistic skill must be rewarded.

351
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,957


352
03:52:02,545 --> 08:28:02,510
Oh, I never expected to find
so much discernment

353
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,752


354
03:47:02,552 --> 09:04:02,516
in an out-of-the way country.

355
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,277


356
02:59:02,601 --> 08:28:02,516
My public ussually shows
less appreciation, showering on me

357
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,875


358
04:55:02,483 --> 09:04:02,516
uneatable objects.

359
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,918


360
04:47:02,491 --> 09:04:02,516
People are so rude!

361
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,038


362
03:34:02,565 --> 09:04:02,516
But give me my watches back!

363
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,994


364
03:08:02,590 --> 09:04:02,515
I ask no more than to be rude, too.

365
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,392


366
04:25:02,513 --> 08:28:02,510
Time flies and I cannot
hold it back.

367
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,075


368
04:30:02,509 --> 08:28:02,516
Allow me to invite you
to my performance.

369
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,319


370
04:20:02,519 --> 09:04:02,516
Mysteries! Amusement!

371
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,913


372
04:05:02,533 --> 09:04:02,516
A heartrending spectacle!

373
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,072


374
04:08:02,529 --> 08:28:02,510
Reduced entrance-fee
for children and soldiers!

375
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,711


376
04:00:02,539 --> 09:04:02,510
Mr. Ernie is a smart fellow.

377
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,150


378
04:29:02,510 --> 08:28:02,516
Did you see him blush
when the major made

379
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,950


380
04:29:02,509 --> 09:04:02,516
that churlish gesture?

381
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,592


382
04:25:02,514 --> 09:04:02,515
A smart fellow, indeed.

383
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,956


384
03:21:02,576 --> 08:28:02,516
He ate and drank his fill
without paying the entrance-fee.

385
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,318


386
03:19:02,580 --> 08:28:02,516
If that devil of yours were near
he would use his pitchfork on us

387
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,436


388
03:51:02,547 --> 08:28:02,516
A because we fancy women
and are hurrying

389
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,068


390
04:33:02,503 --> 09:04:02,516
to a magical pastime.

391
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,156


392
03:57:02,542 --> 09:03:02,515
You are mistaken, Antonín.

393
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,357


394
03:34:02,564 --> 08:28:02,516
I own no devil
and the devil has no pitchfork.

395
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,032


396
03:24:02,575 --> 08:28:02,516
Pretty girls are deucedly scarce
but they do exist.

397
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,509


398
03:19:02,580 --> 08:28:02,516
Each of them has her instrument
and all of them are present.

399
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,710


400
03:32:02,566 --> 08:28:02,510
That rascally Ernie has roused
the town

401
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,279


402
03:21:02,576 --> 09:04:02,516
with his tricks and his bragging.

403
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,672


404
04:28:02,512 --> 08:28:02,516
What else has brought
so many people here?

405
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,189


406
04:00:02,538 --> 09:04:02,510
I am not used to emotion...

407
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,753


408
04:11:02,529 --> 09:04:02,516
Isn t she pretty, though?

409
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,833


410
03:54:02,546 --> 09:04:02,516
Hasn t she got everything?

411
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,872


412
04:20:02,516 --> 08:27:02,516
Antonín, let us ask her
to remove that... array!

413
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,713


414
04:10:02,527 --> 09:04:02,510
These are fruitless trees.

415
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,710


416
03:48:02,551 --> 09:04:02,510
But nature can be corrected.

417
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,556


418
03:12:02,588 --> 09:04:02,516
Are you ready to pay, gentlemen?

419
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,077


420
04:08:02,532 --> 08:28:02,516
Whispering is a bad habit
objected to by moralists.

421
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,754


422
03:17:02,582 --> 08:28:02,516
Ever since it was sondemned
by the catechism, people abstain

423
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,951


424
04:45:02,492 --> 08:28:02,516
from it
except in churches.

425
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,636


426
04:24:02,514 --> 08:28:02,516
Enough!
The lady is in a hurry...

427
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,358


428
02:56:02,602 --> 08:27:02,516
I wager, dear abbé, I can do it
as expertly without any preparation.

429
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,598


430
04:08:02,531 --> 09:04:02,516
Do not overdo things, sir!

431
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,117


432
03:17:02,582 --> 09:04:02,516
I bet he is not following his nose.

433
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,710


434
03:53:02,545 --> 08:28:02,516
It always shows a deviation
to the right or left.

435
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,276


436
04:18:02,521 --> 09:04:02,516
You are talking rubbish.

437
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,916


438
02:31:02,629 --> 09:04:02,516
Did those somersaults seem imperfect?

439
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,189


440
02:37:02,621 --> 08:28:02,516
If you seek perfection in somersaults...
I've got nothing to say

441
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,276


442
04:49:02,490 --> 08:28:02,510
This is a dark night
and a lot of rascals

443
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,349


444
03:35:02,562 --> 08:28:02,510
want to steal your bath towels
and other articles.

445
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,239


446
03:54:02,545 --> 08:28:02,516
Go to sleep, dear Katherine
I shall be keeping watch.

447
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,798


448
03:50:02,548 --> 08:28:02,516
The couch in the cloakroom
will serve for a vigilant rest.

449
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,037


450
03:52:02,546 --> 09:04:02,516
I'll sleep with one eye open.

451
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,796


452
02:51:02,606 --> 09:04:02,516
Open the door, you depraved lecher!

453
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,351


454
04:20:02,517 --> 08:28:02,516
This accursed vocation
has earned me nothing

455
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,039


456
04:32:02,506 --> 09:04:02,516
but insults and injury.

457
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,597


458
03:15:02,582 --> 08:28:02,516
I could have chosen
forom a tidy bunch of young men

459
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,789


460
03:57:02,541 --> 09:04:02,516
and look what I picked out:

461
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,075


462
03:52:02,548 --> 08:28:02,516
A blockhead and a wencher
chasing after quills

463
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,071


464
03:37:02,559 --> 09:04:02,510
with his home full of feathers!

465
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,234


466
03:40:02,559 --> 09:04:02,516
You are drinking, gentlemen?

467
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,433


468
05:10:02,469 --> 09:04:02,516
Is it you, major?

469
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,357


470
04:46:02,493 --> 09:04:02,516
And you, reverend?

471
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,358


472
05:20:02,459 --> 09:04:02,516
Hurry up, now!

473
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,711


474
02:48:02,609 --> 08:28:02,516
Get this poor girl
some warm milk and dry umderwear!

475
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,071


476
03:23:02,576 --> 09:04:02,516
Lam afraid she has got drowned.

477
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,471


478
04:14:02,524 --> 09:04:02,516
I dived for the poor child

479
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,237


480
03:48:02,550 --> 08:28:02,510
a girl hardly 20 years old
or she would have drowned.

481
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,115


482
03:43:02,554 --> 08:28:02,516
I hear it was Anna, the girl
form the conjurer s caravan.

483
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,591


484
03:59:02,541 --> 08:28:02,516
How come you've drag her
through willow trees here.

485
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,475


486
04:37:02,502 --> 08:28:02,516
And that she had
to jump into the river

487
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,394


488
02:36:02,621 --> 09:04:02,510
to save herself from a shameless rake.

489
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,870


490
03:15:02,583 --> 09:04:02,516
It is nice to have a jilly girl friend.

491
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,037


492
05:58:02,420 --> 09:04:02,510
I know it.

493
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,234


494
03:18:02,580 --> 09:04:02,516
The pink little ears, the red lips...

495
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,153


496
04:06:02,533 --> 08:28:02,516
I say, I know it
but the time's passing by.

497
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,952


498
03:37:02,562 --> 09:04:02,516
All that is too easily forgotten.

499
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,676


500
03:20:02,582 --> 08:28:02,516
Being stupid, women have never
aceomplished anything great

501
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,630


502
02:49:02,608 --> 09:04:02,516
and are ignorant of spiritual delights.

503
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,595


504
03:07:02,592 --> 08:28:02,516
Besides causing degeneration
by interbreeding with the offspring

505
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,315


506
03:54:02,543 --> 08:28:02,516
of noblemen, and begetting
readers of deposit books.

507
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,837


508
03:24:02,573 --> 09:04:02,516
Tonight I found a girl in his bed.

509
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,512


510
05:04:02,475 --> 09:04:02,514
Wasn t she wet?

511
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,633


512
04:01:02,535 --> 08:28:02,516
I heard the clink of glass
the purl of water, but alas!

513
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,509


514
04:44:02,495 --> 08:28:02,510
Oh, gosh, father
now it's clear to me.

515
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,310


516
03:23:02,575 --> 08:28:02,510
They deceived me by drenching
her underwear!

517
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,319


518
05:08:02,471 --> 09:03:02,510
Look at Antonín!

519
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,232


520
04:56:02,484 --> 08:28:02,516
Could such an oaf
win a pretty girl?

521
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,749


522
04:01:02,538 --> 09:04:02,516
Are you sure it was Anna?

523
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,512


524
04:40:02,497 --> 09:04:02,516
Canon Roch is right.

525
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,513


526
03:03:02,596 --> 09:04:02,516
It was some hag carrying firewood.

527
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,354


528
04:07:02,530 --> 08:28:02,516
Though lascivious once
your husband is old now.

529
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,319


530
04:04:02,534 --> 09:04:02,510
I know best how old he is.

531
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,153


532
02:29:02,629 --> 08:28:02,510
This wench did not come from the wook
she came from the caravan.

533
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,917


534
04:11:02,528 --> 09:04:02,515
Yes, Canon, it was Anna!

535
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,558


536
04:56:02,482 --> 09:04:02,516
No inactivity here!

537
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,791


538
04:54:02,485 --> 09:04:02,516
No inactivity at all!

539
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,999


540
04:29:02,508 --> 08:28:02,516
This bird reminds me
of your own chickens.

541
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,671


542
02:49:02,609 --> 08:28:02,516
These are the lamentable confusions
of the ripe age.

543
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,909


544
03:27:02,571 --> 08:28:02,516
Love arising from the transition
of periods.

545
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,949


546
03:01:02,598 --> 08:28:02,516
I can see my obese
but respectable wife killing chicken

547
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,952


548
04:25:02,512 --> 08:28:02,514
to carry them blushing
to Ernie s caravan.

549
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,433


550
04:14:02,526 --> 09:04:02,516
I am ready to forgive her

551
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,949


552
03:17:02,581 --> 08:28:02,516
but I want to be sure
her new passion is a lasting one.

553
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,749


554
04:25:02,513 --> 08:28:02,514
Regone lovers, depart
and for heaven s sake

555
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,711


556
05:09:02,470 --> 09:04:02,510
let it be for ever!

557
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,395


558
02:49:02,611 --> 09:04:02,516
How nice is to count days up to three

559
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,074


560
04:16:02,524 --> 08:28:02,510
How beautiful to wander
from town to town!

561
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,590


562
03:05:02,595 --> 09:04:02,516
How beautiful to conjure up flames

563
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,915


564
03:40:02,556 --> 09:04:02,516
to handle nice round objects!

565
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,831


566
03:44:02,554 --> 09:04:02,516
How beautiful... the a lamps!

567
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,633


568
05:00:02,478 --> 08:28:02,516
The magic hat!
And a steep rope.

569
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,875


570
04:34:02,503 --> 09:04:02,515
Oh, it's so wonderful!

571
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,437


572
02:59:02,600 --> 08:28:02,516
Why are we having such fine nights
and such inclement days?

573
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,675


574
03:26:02,574 --> 09:04:02,516
Because you are a great sinner.

575
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,516


576
03:56:02,541 --> 09:04:02,516
Counsider it a punishment.

577
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,189


578
03:51:02,549 --> 08:28:02,516
Rubbish!
We used to be sinning more

579
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,113


580
03:37:02,560 --> 08:28:02,516
and yet the sun was shining...
I don't think this is the point.

581
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,309


582
03:34:02,565 --> 08:28:02,510
The mutual attraction of sexes
is older than rocks

583
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,800


584
03:16:02,582 --> 09:04:02,516
and I can t see a deluge coming!

585
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,269


586
03:08:02,591 --> 08:28:02,516
Do you never feel the urge
to concur with that creative power

587
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,351


588
02:49:02,610 --> 09:04:02,516
in defiance of your Carthusian rules?

589
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,596


590
03:51:02,547 --> 08:27:02,516
Dear Mr. Antonín, thank you
for coming to my aid.

591
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,471


592
04:45:02,493 --> 09:04:02,510
You are so delicate.

593
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,436


594
04:12:02,528 --> 09:04:02,516
Didn t you catch a cold?

595
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,349


596
04:01:02,537 --> 08:28:02,515
I had a cup of tea
and Mrs. Důrová, aou wife

597
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,431


598
04:30:02,506 --> 09:04:02,516
took good care of me.

599
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,154


600
03:48:02,550 --> 09:04:02,516
My wife indulges in idle talk.

601
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,189


602
03:30:02,568 --> 08:28:02,516
Let her stay in a Ernie s Ark
and don t ever go back to him.

603
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,669


604
03:11:02,590 --> 08:28:02,516
Ernie may be a mediocre conjurer
but he is a good foster-father.

605
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,156


606
04:55:02,484 --> 09:04:02,516
Look at his magic!

607
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,951


608
03:08:02,590 --> 08:28:02,516
Katherine playing the barrel-organ
Anna collecting the money

609
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,231


610
03:48:02,550 --> 09:04:02,516
both of them living with him.

611
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,353


612
03:04:02,593 --> 09:04:02,516
This sorcerer has the devil s help!

613
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,518


614
02:37:02,621 --> 09:04:02,516
I've often been afraid you are not sane.

615
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,154


616
04:06:02,533 --> 08:28:02,516
I see I was justified
in my fear for your sanity.

617
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,038


618
03:54:02,543 --> 08:28:02,516
Treating it as a joke
after your wife has left you!

619
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,110


620
02:17:02,643 --> 09:04:02,516
I wonder how Ernie is going to make beds

621
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,631


622
05:08:02,468 --> 09:04:02,510
with two women

623
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,709


624
04:28:02,510 --> 09:04:02,516
and a single bedroom.

625
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,949


626
03:12:02,588 --> 08:28:02,510
I should have given you this book
the first time we met.

627
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,555


628
06:25:02,395 --> 09:04:02,510
Yes?

629
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,792


630
03:58:02,542 --> 08:28:02,510
Yes, dear Anna, it contains
chaste love stories

631
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,158


632
04:30:02,508 --> 09:04:02,516
suitable for your ears.

633
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,399


634
03:42:02,554 --> 08:28:02,516
Excuse me, I am frying fish
the supper might get burned.

635
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,355


636
03:06:02,593 --> 08:28:02,516
Why, the fish are not fresh anyway
and today is not Friday.

637
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,715


638
03:54:02,544 --> 08:28:02,516
All right, I shall let you hold
the saucepan over the fire.

639
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,594


640
04:20:02,519 --> 09:04:02,516
Ernie is a moulting ape.

641
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,471


642
03:55:02,544 --> 09:04:02,514
And he s knock-kneed too!

643
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,308


644
04:17:02,523 --> 09:04:02,516
But he knows the ropes.

645
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,638


646
04:30:02,509 --> 09:04:02,516
Isn t his lass all right!

647
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,199


648
05:38:02,441 --> 09:04:02,510
For the bed!

649
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,591


650
05:56:02,421 --> 09:04:02,515
OK, now!

651
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,756


652
04:06:02,534 --> 08:28:02,516
In the name of the law!
What are you doing here?

653
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,392


654
05:01:02,478 --> 09:04:02,510
I went to see him.

655
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,315


656
02:54:02,604 --> 09:04:02,510
His ear torn and his face all swollen.

657
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,911


658
03:55:02,542 --> 08:28:02,516
He was reading two books
and seemed in good mood.

659
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,277


660
03:42:02,558 --> 08:28:02,516
He ought to show repentance
and castigate himself...

661
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,356


662
03:22:02,577 --> 09:04:02,516
as they did in good monasteries

663
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,319


664
05:03:02,476 --> 09:04:02,514
Isn t he a monk?

665
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,839


666
03:16:02,583 --> 08:28:02,516
No.
Antonin, you should not give him

667
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,712


668
05:03:02,474 --> 09:04:02,510
such bad advice.

669
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,038


670
05:00:02,478 --> 09:04:02,516
He got his desert.

671
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,995


672
03:43:02,557 --> 08:28:02,516
With his ear nearly torn away
needing a few stitches...

673
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,079


674
03:52:02,545 --> 09:04:02,516
Get ready with your needle!

675
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,754


676
02:49:02,612 --> 09:04:02,516
A physician might spread the rumour

677
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,230


678
03:29:02,568 --> 08:28:02,510
that your ear was not damaged
in defence of the Church.

679
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,677


680
02:46:02,611 --> 08:28:02,516
And cos' it is better to keep
our mouth shut about the whole thing

681
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,716


682
04:15:02,524 --> 09:02:02,516
Let Mr. Důra doctor you.

683
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:10,189


684
03:42:02,558 --> 08:28:02,516
He is very skilled with needle
as you know.

685
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,636


686
03:42:02,557 --> 09:02:02,516
Anotnín Důra is a gifted man.

687
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,838


688
03:35:02,565 --> 09:04:02,516
Will you have a glass of wine?

689
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,358


690
04:18:02,521 --> 09:04:02,516
I shall need some spirit.

691
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,149


692
03:50:02,548 --> 08:28:02,516
Or some hot water
for my long neglected tools.

693
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,109


694
03:33:02,567 --> 08:28:02,516
You know I try to avoid trouble
and my nearly nevered ear

695
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,830


696
02:50:02,607 --> 09:04:02,516
cannot make me change my attitude.

697
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:51,549


698
03:36:02,561 --> 08:28:02,510
I returned to Ernie s caravan
and entered into conversation

699
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,071


700
03:31:02,566 --> 09:04:02,516
with Anna who was frying fish.

701
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,958


702
03:33:02,566 --> 09:04:02,516
Did you have supper with her?

703
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,109


704
04:12:02,526 --> 08:28:02,516
I had a morsel of the fish
you caught in the river...

705
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,229


706
02:34:02,625 --> 08:28:02,510
Keep your shameless story to yourself!
I don't want to hear it! I know it!

707
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,514


708
03:54:02,545 --> 09:03:02,515
Be cheerful, abbé, cheerful!

709
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,837


710
03:17:02,581 --> 08:28:02,516
Present you ear with heroic
determination and stop swearing

711
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,399


712
04:37:02,502 --> 09:04:02,516
I might get confused!

713
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,948


714
04:08:02,529 --> 09:04:02,516
Oh, you lecherous poets!

715
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,150


716
03:32:02,565 --> 09:04:02,516
Oh, you confounded literature!

717
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,749


718
04:04:02,534 --> 08:28:02,510
When will artistic writing
turn its back on brothels?

719
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:46,269


720
03:13:02,587 --> 09:04:02,510
And embrace noble civic virtues?

721
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,829


722
04:06:02,533 --> 08:28:02,516
When shall we be reading
about sale and purchase

723
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:01,509


724
03:00:02,599 --> 08:28:02,516
about patrictiam
cattle breeding nad a amelioration?

725
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,831


726
04:34:02,503 --> 08:28:02,516
Or a book of poems
about bodily strength

727
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,709


728
03:08:02,591 --> 09:04:02,516
and agitation for a just class-rule?

729
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,319


730
05:12:02,467 --> 09:04:02,510
When will it be?

731
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,399


732
04:34:02,506 --> 09:04:02,510
In some distant time?

733
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,149


734
02:35:02,623 --> 08:27:02,516
I heard you, abbé
droning verses of no educational value

735
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,395


736
03:37:02,561 --> 08:28:02,516
frothing with the violent blood
and cruelty of specialists

737
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,555


738
03:12:02,584 --> 08:28:02,516
who at the very cost of starvation
always try to introcuce

739
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,519


740
03:54:02,544 --> 09:04:02,516
a new, uninteligible beauty.

741
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,916


742
03:08:02,591 --> 08:28:02,516
The major and I say
it is a nonsensical and vulgar one.

743
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,920


744
02:49:02,609 --> 08:28:02,516
And your manners have become
so dissolute that you get into brawls!

745
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,670


746
04:27:02,511 --> 08:28:02,516
Yes, I got hart and you
sewd up the wound.

747
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,119


748
05:07:02,470 --> 08:28:02,510
It is also true
that i Used to sit

749
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,758


750
03:15:02,582 --> 09:04:02,516
on the river bank, reading books.

751
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,799


752
04:15:02,524 --> 08:28:02,510
Books by Shakespeare
Rabelais and Cervantes.

753
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,870


754
03:04:02,595 --> 08:28:02,516
I would lay down my head for them
as I nearly laid down

755
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,433


756
05:07:02,471 --> 09:04:02,516
my ear for Anna.

757
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,955


758
03:28:02,571 --> 08:28:02,516
The battlefield is the only place
to die nobly.

759
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,199


760
03:08:02,591 --> 09:04:02,516
Poets make bad soldiers, anyhow.

761
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,439


762
05:05:02,473 --> 09:02:02,516
Mr. Důra is right.

763
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,838


764
05:28:02,450 --> 09:04:02,516
What I say is:

765
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,629


766
02:24:02,634 --> 08:28:02,516
Distance can be mensured by wandering
just as affluence by hunger

767
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,317


768
03:56:02,541 --> 09:04:02,516
and play precedes action...

769
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,159


770
03:17:02,583 --> 08:28:02,516
Or, are you not convineed, major
that everything has its origin

771
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:08,189


772
03:15:02,584 --> 08:28:02,516
in the playfulness and courage
of people who have time to spare

773
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,238


774
04:46:02,491 --> 08:28:02,516
to babble like Gods
marshalling things

775
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,958


776
03:53:02,546 --> 09:04:02,516
into an amasing sequence?

777
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,559


778
03:56:02,541 --> 08:27:02,516
I observe, Antonín,
your character is changing

779
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,996


780
04:33:02,504 --> 08:28:02,516
you have just spoken
in favour of potery!

781
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,719


782
05:06:02,472 --> 09:04:02,515
No, no, forsooth!

783
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,195


784
04:02:02,537 --> 09:04:02,516
I never thought of doing it.

785
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:44,549


786
03:38:02,560 --> 08:28:02,516
Dear madam, near Mülhausen
we got into a snowstorm.

787
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,710


788
03:55:02,544 --> 08:28:02,510
The funnel not drawing
it was cold in the caravan...

789
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,832


790
02:56:02,602 --> 09:04:02,510
You know what foul weather means.

791
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,351


792
03:36:02,564 --> 09:04:02,516
But was your caaravan clean?

793
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,910


794
04:29:02,510 --> 08:28:02,516
Only a well kept home
is pleasant to live in.

795
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,593


796
03:24:02,576 --> 08:28:02,515
I intend to make some coverlets
and cushion, Ernie

797
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,159


798
05:22:02,455 --> 09:04:02,510
to embelish it.

799
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,673


800
04:40:02,499 --> 09:04:02,516
Don t forgot the rug.

801
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,673


802
04:30:02,509 --> 08:28:02,516
Anna burnt a hole in it
with a cigarette.

803
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,476


804
04:10:02,529 --> 09:04:02,516
I reproved her yesterday.

805
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,711


806
02:42:02,616 --> 09:04:02,516
She is damaging wilfully our property.

807
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,749


808
03:19:02,580 --> 08:28:02,516
If she does not mend her was
I shall give her an hour s notice.

809
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:36,670


810
03:28:02,570 --> 08:28:02,510
Ernie will not leave his caravan
in this weather...

811
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:43,389


812
02:39:02,619 --> 08:28:02,516
I see you want to stay at home
and that you have hardened you heart.

813
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,191


814
04:32:02,507 --> 08:28:02,516
Is it the very first time
you got the mitten?

815
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,673


816
03:55:02,543 --> 09:04:02,516
Leave sour thougths alone.

817
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,470


818
03:35:02,563 --> 08:28:02,516
Get reconciled with the Canon
who is only and instrument

819
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,039


820
05:21:02,456 --> 09:04:02,516
of providence.

821
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,035


822
03:19:02,580 --> 08:28:02,510
Have you forgotten how we used
to hunt on the river bank

823
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:06,509


824
02:55:02,604 --> 09:04:02,510
for earth worms who love moisture?

825
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,314


826
03:59:02,538 --> 09:04:02,516
The pleasant conversation

827
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,270


828
03:23:02,574 --> 08:28:02,516
the delightful squabbles we had
which always ended well...

829
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,512


830
03:22:02,577 --> 09:03:02,516
Antonín, all that is coming back!

831
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,678


832
03:58:02,541 --> 08:28:02,510
I have said many times
Anna does not fit into such

833
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,239


834
05:23:02,454 --> 09:04:02,516
surroundings.

835
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,878


836
03:44:02,555 --> 09:04:02,516
Look how puzzled she looks!

837
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,111


838
04:22:02,516 --> 09:04:02,516
Her plate nearly empty!

839
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,349


840
03:44:02,555 --> 08:28:02,516
You should marry her, major
I think she is being ill-treated

841
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,873


842
05:11:02,467 --> 09:02:02,516
by Mrs. Důrová.

843
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,709


844
03:37:02,561 --> 09:04:02,515
Miss Anna, leave the caraven.

845
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,996


846
05:37:02,441 --> 09:04:02,510
Come to us!

847
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,032


848
04:10:02,526 --> 08:28:02,514
Take my swimming bath
take the Canon s books.

849
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,792


850
04:27:02,513 --> 09:04:02,516
What about the major?

851
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,759


852
04:29:02,512 --> 08:28:02,516
I shall kill the conjurer
and got to jail.

853
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,999


854
05:49:02,428 --> 09:04:02,510
Get down!

855
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:51,149


856
03:45:02,554 --> 08:28:02,516
Come down, mister!
And do not tempt providence

857
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,438


858
03:37:02,561 --> 08:28:02,516
You re going to hurt yourself!
And you'll get nothing for that

859
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,840


860
03:17:02,580 --> 09:04:02,516
Stop that nonsense, come down!

861
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,153


862
05:11:02,468 --> 09:04:02,516
What did I say?!

863
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,199


864
04:35:02,503 --> 09:04:02,516
The conjurer is dead!

865
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,510


866
04:52:02,486 --> 08:28:02,516
He s simulating!
- The bump he got!

867
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,239


868
03:59:02,540 --> 08:28:02,516
Serves him right.
Why did he climb up there!

869
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:47,349


870
03:25:02,572 --> 08:28:02,516
Let s collect a few crowns
and buy him a hen for his soup.

871
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,635


872
03:28:02,568 --> 08:28:02,514
Don t forget, dear neighbour
we don t hold with collections.

873
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,513


874
04:00:02,537 --> 09:04:02,516
Think what you could buy!

875
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,239


876
04:20:02,518 --> 09:04:02,516
And have a good time...

877
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,239


878
04:50:02,489 --> 09:04:02,516
He is a poor fellow.

879
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:06,316


880
03:03:02,595 --> 08:28:02,516
He deserves spanking
so that the town is peace]ful again!

881
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,473


882
04:55:02,483 --> 09:04:02,516
You cry too much!

883
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,994


884
02:29:02,630 --> 08:28:02,516
My companion hates murdeous tumbles
as much as blubbering.

885
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,037


886
04:05:02,534 --> 08:28:02,516
Now put on Ernie s tights
for another performance.

887
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,951


888
04:50:02,488 --> 09:04:02,516
A crowd is waiting!

889
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,871


890
03:14:02,586 --> 08:28:02,516
Am I, a respectable citizen s wife
to také part publicly

891
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,909


892
03:42:02,558 --> 09:04:02,516
in deception and subterfuge?

893
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:37,269


894
03:49:02,550 --> 08:28:02,516
I am used to a decent house
and I shall have it again

895
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,669


896
02:55:02,603 --> 09:03:02,516
because Antonín is calling me back.

897
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,479


898
04:20:02,519 --> 08:28:02,516
I saw him several times
near the caravan, pole

899
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:49,509


900
03:55:02,545 --> 08:28:02,516
perturbed and ready to tear
the caravan into splinters.

901
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,553


902
05:28:02,451 --> 09:04:02,516
You are right.

903
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,356


904
03:32:02,568 --> 08:28:02,516
You left your hearth for a while
and now you are the martyr...

905
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,312


906
03:58:02,541 --> 08:28:02,516
Go home
before I reach for my stick!

907
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,954


908
03:10:02,587 --> 08:28:02,516
I used to know some verses
fitting the most terrible situations.

909
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:21,629


910
03:34:02,566 --> 08:28:02,510
Unfortunately I only remember
the first line:

911
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,596


912
04:03:02,533 --> 09:03:02,516
""Také to your heels...""

913
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,279


914
04:07:02,533 --> 09:04:02,516
Don t you know the rest?

915
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,232


916
04:49:02,491 --> 08:28:02,516
No.
But the abbé might.

917
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,869


918
04:23:02,515 --> 08:28:02,510
...she was dancing
in the circus Ferdinand

919
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,439


920
04:10:02,527 --> 09:04:02,516
with a pear in her mouth.

921
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,557


922
04:09:02,531 --> 08:28:02,510
People called it eccentric
and I do think

923
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,153


924
04:08:02,531 --> 09:04:02,516
it was far from becoming.

925
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,718


926
03:34:02,565 --> 09:04:02,516
Fresch lips need no ornament.

927
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,673


928
05:52:02,428 --> 09:04:02,516
Oh, major

929
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:28,189


930
02:36:02,624 --> 08:28:02,510
Displaying the mechanism of her joints
and the ontraction-of her muscular

931
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,438


932
03:58:02,541 --> 08:29:02,516
system
Anna is the personification

933
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,034


934
04:11:02,527 --> 08:28:02,510
of all that constitutes
the roots of theatrical art

935
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,595


936
02:59:02,597 --> 08:28:02,516
a glorification of God
who created men in his own image.

937
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,513


938
06:19:02,399 --> 09:04:02,510
Anna!

939
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,996


940
04:25:02,515 --> 09:04:02,516
Where have you been?

941
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,272


942
03:28:02,571 --> 08:28:02,510
I stopped at the swimming-bath
it is in shambles!

943
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,399


944
03:52:02,548 --> 09:04:02,516
What have you been doing?

945
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,110


946
03:01:02,597 --> 09:04:02,516
Oh, you have come for your things.

947
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:04,069


948
03:33:02,565 --> 09:03:02,516
Také them and get out of here!

949
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,997


950
04:16:02,522 --> 09:04:02,516
I decided to forgive you.

951
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,074


952
04:36:02,502 --> 08:28:02,516
You got your desert
for you faithlesspess

953
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,949


954
03:44:02,555 --> 08:28:02,516
living for three days
in an untidy, neglected home

955
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,270


956
04:15:02,523 --> 08:28:02,516
without proper meals
and a good night s rest.

957
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,039


958
04:10:02,528 --> 08:28:02,516
I can no longer be
angry whith you, Anonín.

959
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,716


960
04:46:02,491 --> 09:04:02,510
So much the better.

961
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,633


962
05:05:02,473 --> 08:28:02,516
But my defects
are past remedy.

963
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:33,990


964
04:03:02,534 --> 08:28:02,516
Today I saw a woman
washing linen in the river.

965
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,278


966
03:33:02,565 --> 08:28:02,516
She was not as pretty as Anna
and yet I felt

967
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,954


968
04:54:02,484 --> 08:28:02,510
I had not changed.
Silence!

969
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,593


970
04:30:02,508 --> 08:28:02,516
You may stay
but mind your tongue!

971
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,114


972
04:56:02,481 --> 09:04:02,515
Oh, how beatiful...

973
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,075


974
04:24:02,512 --> 08:28:02,516
Look where you hit
you might hurt my girl.

975
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,839


976
05:52:02,427 --> 08:28:02,516
Your girl?
Your girl?

977
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,633


978
03:57:02,543 --> 09:04:02,516
Have you lost you senses?

979
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,029


980
03:42:02,558 --> 08:28:02,516
No, because Anna stays here
and you go away.

981
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,832


982
03:14:02,583 --> 08:28:02,510
Let us be lenient
with the weekness of our friends.

983
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,678


984
05:36:02,442 --> 09:04:02,510
Let him live!

985
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,239


986
04:43:02,495 --> 09:04:02,516
Don t kill the major!

987
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,593


988
05:03:02,477 --> 09:04:02,516
Are you all right?

989
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:43,789


990
03:58:02,539 --> 08:28:02,516
This morning the magician
beat me up with his wand.

991
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,075


992
04:21:02,518 --> 08:28:02,516
I have still more reason
for complaining.

993
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,760


994
03:38:02,560 --> 09:04:02,510
Katherine has returned home!
