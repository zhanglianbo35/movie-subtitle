1
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:10,836
Look at those bees.

2
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:13,646
They have been making honey
for thousands years

3
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:15,797
to keep their species alive.

4
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:19,243
One bee dies, another takes
its place.

5
00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:23,559
They die because of frost,
diseases and people.

6
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:32,477
But the hive lives on forever.

7
00:00:34,647 --> 00:00:39,641
The Slovak Film Institute
presents

8
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:48,486
THE MILLENNIAL BEE

9
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:56,080
Based on the novel
by Peter Jaros

10
00:00:57,407 --> 00:01:02,356
Story:

11
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:08,325
Starring:

12
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:16,277
I do not remember we have ever
gathered honey in June.

13
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:22,203
We may have two crops
as in the Nile valley.

14
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:27,800
A birthday present for you.
The map of Europe.

15
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:35,282
Wow, Debrecen.
And here, Venice.

16
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:38,965
I still long for journeys abroad.

17
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:40,685
Leave then as soon as possible.

18
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:47,559
The Paris Commune started
a new era, with new countries,

19
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:49,603
old maps will not be valid.

20
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:58,197
On behalf of the firemen's guild
let me wish you all the best.

21
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:04,038
The golden helmet will protect
you from storms and fire.

22
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:08,522
From women's anger too?

23
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:11,563
There is no protection
against that!

24
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:14,719
It is worse than fire and water
together.

25
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:16,320
They are witches.

26
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:18,318
- No, Valent.
- Do not be scared.

27
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:20,682
You do not love me.

28
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:24,476
Once you are a student
you will forget about me!

29
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:28,116
I will not, if you are mine!

30
00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:33,326
Oh my God, bees!

31
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:36,844
I love you all the same!

32
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:39,476
Look what you have done!

33
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:46,279
Dear friends, let me propose
a toast to Martin, our master bricklayer,

34
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:50,998
who has travelled
all over the world.

35
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:52,243
Bees!

36
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:57,401
We wish you all the best.

37
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:02,279
What is that?

38
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:05,643
Calm down, do not move!

39
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:08,522
They are but bees,
they will not hurt you.

40
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:12,486
They will eat us alive!

41
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,683
I shall smoke the bees to death!

42
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:18,084
Who is the asshole
who startled them?

43
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:26,843
Good afternoon, Father.
Run away!

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,074
Advertise your product or brand here

45
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:46,877
You will see what a son
I shall give to Hungary!

46
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,279
Have a drink with me, Gersch!

47
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:54,963
I shall father three Hungarians!
I can make you a Hungarian!

48
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:58,125
I doubt you can,
I am a Jew.

49
00:03:58,207 --> 00:04:02,166
I shall arrange it!

50
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:08,846
What kind of a Hungarian are you?
Your father was a Slovak.

51
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:11,885
But I am a Hungarian!
Give me the bottle!

52
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,878
You have one in Budapest.

53
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:18,518
One pen, one shepherd.

54
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:21,679
And an asshole with a sabre.

55
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:24,804
I shall get the bill
through the Parliament

56
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:27,117
that those who refuse to be
Hungarians

57
00:04:27,207 --> 00:04:29,641
will be castrated!

58
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,561
What kind of a nonsense is that?
You were not a bad pupil.

59
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:36,400
But you are a bad teacher.

60
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:42,357
Hungarian is the official language.

61
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:46,766
Fools make speeches,
wise men love girls.

62
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:52,163
- You do look pretty.
- It is still aching.

63
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:57,081
Why do you not speak
our language?

64
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:02,476
Get out of the way!

65
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,046
Trying to sting a Hungarian
nobleman,

66
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,243
you, the bee of Pichanda?

67
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:14,076
Let her be or I will kill you!

68
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:18,558
I shall have you all arrested!

69
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:20,160
Come on!

70
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:23,319
Watch out!

71
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:27,244
No!

72
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,683
Bees sting, Belan!

73
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:34,476
- I was stung by a bee yesterday.
- Come on, Maria.

74
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:50,761
Kristina, where are you?
Come to dance to the ballroom!

75
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:53,759
That is Matej.
Speak to him at least.

76
00:05:55,087 --> 00:06:00,161
He must not see me now!

77
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,166
Bloody bees!

78
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:09,685
The old wizard will stay
in the pub till the morning.

79
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:12,036
He thinks he is still young!

80
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,043
I am closing.

81
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,442
Mr. Gersch!

82
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,487
I want to convert
to your faith,

83
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:33,158
I will learn Hebrew and study
the Talmud.

84
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:37,361
Jozef, one must not betray
the faith of one's fathers.

85
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:39,438
One should keep it.

86
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:42,360
To hell with your fathers' faith.

87
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:45,883
You worship Yahve,
you Virgin Mary.

88
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:50,518
And I, as people say,
the whale.

89
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:54,316
Call Marta, please.

90
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:02,161
A farewell dance for Jozef.
A sad song.

91
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:06,043
He is joining us.

92
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:09,440
I would like to be a Jew.

93
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:13,236
And I a Christian.

94
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:58,766
Golden rain.

95
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:02,678
Yellow rain.

96
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:08,999
Pink.

97
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:19,280
And now green. Why not frogs?

98
00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:28,325
Frogs, a French delicacy.

99
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:34,724
On June 20, 1896

100
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:38,800
I celebrated my sixty.

101
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:44,003
But I feel strong.

102
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:50,078
I still have the same thoughts

103
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:53,284
as forty years ago.

104
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,598
I even see similar signs.

105
00:08:57,127 --> 00:09:00,119
When I went to work abroad
for the first time

106
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,846
and saw mushrooms sticking
out of snow.

107
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:11,279
I started to pick them up

108
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:16,725
and then I met Zelka.

109
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:21,319
Have you forgotten me, Martin?

110
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:25,846
No, I have not, Zelka.

111
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:30,398
Let us play cards.

112
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,719
I cannot. I must go to Debrecen.

113
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,958
We used to see each other
more often.

114
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,005
You are still pretty.

115
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:44,445
What is that? What is going on?

116
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:46,199
The fish has closed its mouth.

117
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:50,565
- What fish?
- A whale.

118
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:54,322
- Stop lying!
- You lied to me.

119
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:58,286
You married a richer girl.

120
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:01,200
Randomize them.

121
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:11,156
- What is going on?
- Do not worry.

122
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,922
When the fish opens its mouth
we shall run out.

123
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:24,842
Meanwhile, we can drink, eat

124
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:29,364
and play cards.

125
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:38,875
In good humour and Christian
understanding, Zelka and I spent

126
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:41,561
four days inside the whale.

127
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:44,957
I will not let you go!

128
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:47,800
I will come back, do not worry.

129
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:51,118
I will bring you such a scarf
that will attract bees.

130
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:55,803
No, no bees. Birds
and butterflies instead.

131
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,677
I know what is pulling you.

132
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:04,804
You'd better think of the grave

133
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:07,926
and eternal salvation.

134
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:12,042
And what else?

135
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:17,207
Mother, what is the matter?

136
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:19,641
Scissors!

137
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,242
Open your mouth!

138
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:24,363
Hold her head!

139
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:30,079
Here is the bastard.

140
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:33,722
God warned us.

141
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:39,882
He sometimes punishes
even the just ones.

142
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:50,122
Fish... What does that mean?

143
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:54,685
Women, perhaps? That could be.

144
00:11:57,247 --> 00:11:59,715
Welcome, Martin.

145
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:04,597
I was dreaming about you.

146
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:09,915
About the time when we were
very young.

147
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:12,157
Do you remember?

148
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:17,367
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

149
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:20,803
You are still attractive.

150
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:23,037
and I am...

151
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:25,596
You wanton old devil!

152
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:28,155
Are you looking for a lover?

153
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,444
I have been atoning for our sin
all my life,

154
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:36,521
but now you, old goat,
want to tempt me again?

155
00:12:37,287 --> 00:12:41,200
Just let us have a talk.

156
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:45,963
Do not be angry.

157
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:51,283
How about a game of cards?

158
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:53,725
Do you have a pack?

159
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:15,845
On St. Peter and Paul's Day
grass needs mowing

160
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:21,604
so we, the bricklayers,
become farmers for a while again.

161
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:27,444
The men go to meadows
to mow all the days.

162
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:33,561
Forgive me.

163
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:40,326
Women at home go to beds late
and get up early.

164
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:42,682
They bring meal to the mowers.

165
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:46,965
The men are sweaty, tired,
in need of a shave.

166
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:50,642
The women are affectionate then.

167
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:55,084
Kristina, does your mother
keeps an eye on you?

168
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,364
I do it myself!

169
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:04,243
- Stop! Give me a kiss.
- After the wedding.

170
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:07,161
- Give me your hand.
- On the wedding day.

171
00:14:07,687 --> 00:14:12,044
- Then beat me.
- After the wedding.

172
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:15,957
Now. I cannot stand it anymore.

173
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:31,645
My dumplings!

174
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:36,766
Look what you have done!

175
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,719
We can clean them.

176
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:46,599
What turmoil was it in the pub?

177
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:50,726
As if you wanted a war
against the emperor.

178
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,718
Against monkeys, perhaps.

179
00:14:52,807 --> 00:15:00,999
I read that the English claim
two African islands.

180
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:08,157
Pemba and Zanzibar.

181
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,962
They are very small.

182
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:16,765
Perhaps there will be war.

183
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:20,203
Because of the two islands?

184
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:23,803
Africa might be the reason.

185
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:28,080
Africa means wealth.

186
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:32,446
Did you cook this, Kristina?

187
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:37,123
She will learn when she marries.

188
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:43,283
Our wine has always been fine.
Young women, old wine.

189
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:47,399
I hear you are going to study
in Prague, Valent.

190
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:51,241
He would like to be a lawyer.

191
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:57,284
During holidays you could teach
my daughter German.

192
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:03,557
- Do you agree, Martin?
- He can decide himself.

193
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:07,039
I do not teach young ladies.

194
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:12,046
I will pay you.

195
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:31,236
The young Pichanda is here.

196
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:35,236
Welcome, Valent.

197
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:39,359
Leave us alone, Mother.

198
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:46,640
- Are you in love?
- No, I am not.

199
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:49,563
- And you?
- Me either.

200
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:52,639
But I would like to be.

201
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,197
- The textbooks?
- Will these do?

202
00:16:59,407 --> 00:17:01,967
We'd better start.

203
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:05,039
Do you like me?

204
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:09,041
I am paid for German lessons.

205
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:13,518
Sure. But I choose the topic.

206
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:18,082
Love.

207
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,364
Where have you been?

208
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:27,042
I teach German.

209
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:29,357
You teach Hermina?

210
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,438
She wants you, you know?

211
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:33,643
I need every penny.

212
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:36,116
You know I am leaving
next month.

213
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:41,679
Is she prettier than I?
Do you not want me anymore?

214
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:51,679
I do, I love you.

215
00:17:57,687 --> 00:18:00,679
Oh my God, you are
so beautiful...

216
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,917
Forgive me, oh Lord.

217
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:20,359
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Samo.

218
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:22,839
Are you going to help us?

219
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:24,799
We can manage.

220
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:41,241
Are you joining your father?

221
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:43,318
There is plenty to do at home.

222
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:49,118
Go and earn a lot of money.

223
00:18:50,207 --> 00:18:53,563
That is all my wife understands.

224
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:01,602
Gagos, is there going to be the war?

225
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:08,206
Three things are needed for it:
money, dough, and loot.

226
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:11,279
Suppose there is?

227
00:19:13,647 --> 00:19:16,639
I would know about that.

228
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:19,961
Twenty-nine, thirty...

229
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:25,600
Leaving?

230
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:33,683
This will protect you.
Always and anywhere.

231
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:34,923
Gold?

232
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:39,444
To my teacher
from his grateful student.

233
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:52,763
Valent, this is her hair!

234
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,518
She wants to bewitch you!

235
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:05,006
You are the only one I love!

236
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:08,640
I shall not give you it!

237
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:12,081
Oh Lord, forgive me.

238
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:16,117
I shall not give you to anybody!

239
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:23,438
A ball lightning!

240
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:27,718
- Do not pull so fast.
- I do not.

241
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:32,325
Look.

242
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:34,995
Who did that?

243
00:20:36,807 --> 00:20:39,879
That must be investigated!

244
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:50,242
A week before
St. Bartholomew's Day

245
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:54,479
a large glowing ball rolled
through our village.

246
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:59,436
All of us sighed with relief
when it was beyond the village at last.

247
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:03,918
But at the crossroads it hit the mill.

248
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,676
Fire!

249
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:34,161
My poor children!
Where shall we go?

250
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:36,678
Form a chain!

251
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:46,843
The mill burnt down
for the third time.

252
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:50,955
Come to the taproom, Marta.

253
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:55,319
We can make much money now.

254
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:01,315
The miller ended up badly.

255
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:03,841
The government should help him.

256
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:07,158
Everybody needs the mill.

257
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:09,238
Why are you moaning?

258
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:13,605
You have fixed wages,
and a pension on top of it.

259
00:22:13,687 --> 00:22:15,757
If I am not dismissed!

260
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:16,916
It is all nonsense.

261
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:20,682
He is satisfied, can you see?
He has set fire himself.

262
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:23,361
Nonsense!

263
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:25,877
There is one poor man more.

264
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:28,356
I built him a chimney
the other day.

265
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,962
He has not paid yet,
and will never do so.

266
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:36,438
Now that we have the railway
we should build houses here

267
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:40,805
and send them by rail
all over the empire.

268
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:42,206
What for?

269
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:48,082
We could build Vienna and
Budapest here, by the river,

270
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:50,078
and then transport there.

271
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:55,519
We would transport nothing away
if Vienna were here.

272
00:22:56,647 --> 00:23:00,640
I would open a bank
and employ all of you.

273
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:03,525
A bank? You?

274
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:07,159
He will ruin Rothschild.

275
00:23:08,247 --> 00:23:10,886
Oskara, a banker!

276
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:36,840
Oh, Yahve!

277
00:23:42,127 --> 00:23:45,278
We all are God's children.

278
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,202
The miller...

279
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:20,682
- Who knows where they are going.
- Somewhere to Hungary.

280
00:24:20,847 --> 00:24:25,716
On St. Michael's Day, 1896,

281
00:24:25,807 --> 00:24:29,561
I put together a team
of bricklayers,

282
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:32,281
maybe my last one.

283
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:37,202
There was Dropa, the barber
who cuts our hair,

284
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:42,805
then the Left-hander Svanda
whose left arm is stronger

285
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:45,640
and is used instead of
common sense,

286
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:53,318
Gunar, nicknamed the Sage,

287
00:24:53,487 --> 00:24:57,480
Greben, nicknamed the Fish,
as he never speaks,

288
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:02,525
and my son Samo, nicknamed the Bee.

289
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:05,041
Finished. Next, please!

290
00:25:05,127 --> 00:25:08,085
Come on, Jozef! Get him, boys!

291
00:25:09,447 --> 00:25:10,641
I shall kill myself!

292
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:12,206
Do not worry!

293
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:17,486
The young Nader joined us too.
Still in love with the Jewess.

294
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:23,005
The barber's red-headed sister Stazka
joined us as a cook.

295
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:27,365
Good you are going with us.

296
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:29,836
Nobody will touch my sister!

297
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:35,165
Not another word or I shall give you
the trim like Jozef got.

298
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,924
Look, the sun is rising!

299
00:26:15,527 --> 00:26:18,724
Go home, Zanzibar!

300
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:26,085
We did not have to come
here then.

301
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,886
How much do you want then?

302
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:34,963
Thirteen guldens each,
eighteen to the foreman.

303
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:39,922
The truth is somewhere
in between.

304
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:44,876
I propose ten to each worker,
fifteen to the master.

305
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:47,606
And I give you some advance.

306
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:54,206
Good. Give us forty
and we shall pay to our cook.

307
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:04,760
Damn! What an asshole?

308
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:15,557
- Who are they?
- The police will defend you.

309
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,639
We can manage ourselves.

310
00:27:23,487 --> 00:27:27,275
Do not be scared of them.

311
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:33,956
What do you want?

312
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:36,242
You will not build here

313
00:27:36,327 --> 00:27:39,239
until bricklayers' wages
are increased.

314
00:27:39,327 --> 00:27:40,043
We are on strike.

315
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:43,881
It is none of our business.
I need money, I will work!

316
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:46,686
Wait, listen to him!

317
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:50,316
I have not a land as you have.

318
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:53,843
I only have what I earn
with my hands by the wall.

319
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:56,122
I have got four children

320
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,038
but I have not been working
for two weeks, as I believe...

321
00:27:58,127 --> 00:27:59,640
You are workshy!

322
00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:03,242
...the people like him
will yield at last.

323
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:08,043
You are right.

324
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:12,640
We can go to Tisovec,
there is work too.

325
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:15,878
Of course not! You got advance!

326
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:18,686
Here it is!

327
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:23,995
And this is for the beer
we drank yesterday.

328
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:28,842
You are silent but you help.

329
00:28:28,927 --> 00:28:34,524
Men, we shall pay you some beer!

330
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:48,919
If I had Rothschild's millions,

331
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:53,239
I would assemble a bricklayer
driven by steam!

332
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:56,323
Sage!

333
00:28:56,407 --> 00:29:00,241
Why are you laughing?
It would toil instead of us.

334
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:04,477
We all would become bankers.

335
00:29:04,847 --> 00:29:09,238
We would eat, drink and dance
till daybreak.

336
00:29:09,527 --> 00:29:12,837
The Left-hander is
already dancing.

337
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:16,918
I was stung by the bloody bee!

338
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:20,842
Why did you flail?

339
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:25,158
Lunch break!

340
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:28,637
I would like to be a bee.

341
00:29:29,007 --> 00:29:31,885
I would fly and drink beer.

342
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:36,724
Without the passport
as far as Budapest!

343
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:37,956
I would not like that.

344
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:39,639
There would be no man
or a woman.

345
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:41,797
You know how the bees do it.

346
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:45,921
I do not. How do they do it?

347
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:49,922
Once in the whole life.

348
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:56,679
Mind your soup!

349
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:00,997
Have you ever kissed a girl?

350
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:09,276
My sweet fish.

351
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:13,164
I will give you anything.

352
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:16,956
What is going on here?

353
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:21,038
We are drinking milk.

354
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:26,076
Stop smiling or I slap you!

355
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:30,760
I can love whoever I want to!

356
00:30:30,847 --> 00:30:34,556
If you only heard him sing!

357
00:30:34,647 --> 00:30:36,524
I like him!

358
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:38,366
You are stupid!

359
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:43,397
He is mute as a fish.

360
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:47,119
Come on, sing us a song.

361
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:51,640
- Go ahead, sing.
- Sing, Juro.

362
00:30:57,607 --> 00:31:05,321
<i>God /oves the young ones</i>

363
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:13,041
<i>When they k/ss //ke doves.</i>

364
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:19,595
<i>O/d fo/ks have a bad score</i>

365
00:31:19,687 --> 00:31:26,763
<i>/f they do not /ove anymore.</i>

366
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,485
Water!

367
00:31:40,487 --> 00:31:42,159
You are handsome now.

368
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:45,842
The pretty Jewess
will like you again.

369
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:52,322
I would not discourage you
even if he worshipped a whale.

370
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:55,200
What is that about the whale?

371
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:59,121
People say that about bricklayers
who go astray.

372
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:03,280
My and your grandfathers
once roamed as far as Madagascar.

373
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:07,079
By land and by sea.
There were no trains then.

374
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:14,884
What a country! Everybody naked,
and burnt black by the sun.

375
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:19,519
And the women there!
Incredible!

376
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:23,282
Your grandfather married
three of them.

377
00:32:23,327 --> 00:32:24,316
How did they speak?

378
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:28,076
They taught the natives
the Slovak language.

379
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:30,158
Stop turning his head!

380
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:35,241
But it is true!
Our grandfather said it too.

381
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:36,436
What happened next?

382
00:32:36,527 --> 00:32:38,722
There is no place like home.

383
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:42,925
Despite having many kids there
they returned home,

384
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:45,965
to our native place.

385
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,641
If all those black children
arrive here

386
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:50,126
there will be more of us

387
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:51,526
than the Austrians and Hungarians
together.

388
00:32:51,607 --> 00:32:55,395
Who says the Slovaks have
no colonies?

389
00:33:04,127 --> 00:33:06,800
Get up, men!

390
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:12,481
The Hungarian land is ahead!
Get up, lazybones!

391
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:20,599
Somebody has left his tools here.

392
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:24,955
Where is Jozef Nader?

393
00:33:27,127 --> 00:33:29,880
He has longed for his Jewess.

394
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,639
He seems to have taken off.

395
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:34,321
What a bugger!

396
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,932
Who will do his work?

397
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:42,755
Let us move off, we may
catch up with him.

398
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:48,517
Let him be, we have much to do.

399
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:52,919
We had good luck at Miskolc.

400
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:58,279
We were hired by Baron Csernak
who had spent all his life

401
00:33:58,367 --> 00:34:02,758
collecting pictures and statues.

402
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:07,199
In the hall there stood
a statue of Diana

403
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:10,439
which took the men's breath away.

404
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:12,836
Like Virgin Mary.

405
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:16,761
But with no clothes on.

406
00:34:19,327 --> 00:34:22,285
You lecherous scoundrels!

407
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:26,319
Oh, what melons!

408
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:36,601
We made a good deal,
except there was no advance.

409
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:41,204
We got some female helpers instead,

410
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:45,883
swarthy girls from the south,

411
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:53,161
voluptuous, buxom beauties.

412
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:59,076
Would you like to have me, Julca?

413
00:34:59,927 --> 00:35:02,760
- What do you say?
- Do you want him?

414
00:35:04,047 --> 00:35:07,596
You are a good man
but Duri is better.

415
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:11,236
Better.

416
00:35:11,327 --> 00:35:14,319
And what about me?

417
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:24,084
If you want to earn, go on building!
Work cannot be postponed!

418
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,806
What a crew of bricklayers you are!

419
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:30,721
After chasing women all night,

420
00:35:30,807 --> 00:35:34,800
you cannot hold a brick
on the following morning!

421
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:38,357
Hear that, Fish? Sing now!

422
00:35:38,607 --> 00:35:41,963
It was strange that the Baron
had vanished

423
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:45,244
and no one knew
when he would return.

424
00:35:45,327 --> 00:35:49,923
Remember when we erected
the wall near Budapest

425
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:54,840
and the police chased after us?

426
00:35:55,487 --> 00:36:00,083
Hopefully that will not happen again.

427
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:04,360
Do not worry, Sage,
we are no greenhorns.

428
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:28,404
Foreman, I have brought
you money!

429
00:36:33,447 --> 00:36:38,043
Roll out a barrel of wine!

430
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:44,597
I was not sure I could get the money.

431
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:55,158
I had to gamble a day and night
at Mayhofer's and won!

432
00:36:59,127 --> 00:37:02,358
Did you worry I would not come?

433
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:05,644
I both did and did not.

434
00:37:06,887 --> 00:37:09,720
Some statues are very valuable.

435
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:13,277
Is my Diana away?

436
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:16,757
She is back in her place.

437
00:37:22,527 --> 00:37:25,121
I underestimated you, foreman.

438
00:37:25,207 --> 00:37:30,804
Julca, sing for these fellows!
Let them remember us well!

439
00:37:48,847 --> 00:37:50,439
Nobody will believe us.

440
00:37:50,927 --> 00:37:53,919
Not a word about that at home.

441
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:58,523
On the contrary, exaggerate!

442
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:04,199
Nobody will be able to distinguish
between the truth and lies.

443
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:15,320
I did it!

444
00:38:19,207 --> 00:38:22,324
Let us go, bricklayers!

445
00:38:22,887 --> 00:38:25,003
Let us go.

446
00:38:25,087 --> 00:38:29,285
If I were not here,
you would be led astray too.

447
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:36,366
We are at home, jump down!

448
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:48,358
One day you will break
your necks!

449
00:38:48,447 --> 00:38:50,438
I go as the first, Father.

450
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:53,883
Where is the boy pelting along?

451
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:57,755
To try his luck.
To see his beloved.

452
00:38:59,607 --> 00:39:02,201
What can you tell me
about Jozko Nader?

453
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:06,405
He has been sitting at Gersch's
and drinking like a fish.

454
00:39:07,727 --> 00:39:09,718
Your dog is waiting for you!

455
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:12,196
Zanzibar, you are here?!

456
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:15,085
Stop embracing,
our job has ended.

457
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:19,285
You can keep your money,
my daughter is not for sale.

458
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:22,757
I do not want to buy Maria.

459
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:30,242
- But she will be unhappy.
- Do not worry about that!

460
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:34,159
Where have you been so long?

461
00:39:37,927 --> 00:39:42,284
Good-bye then.

462
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:45,325
If you prefer Belanyi...

463
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:03,155
Have a drink with us. I pay it.

464
00:40:08,487 --> 00:40:11,957
Is everything all right, Jozef?

465
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:16,763
I arrived too late.

466
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:20,517
But she will have my child.

467
00:40:21,327 --> 00:40:24,524
- Mine!
- We all are God's children.

468
00:40:24,607 --> 00:40:26,802
Then why did you not let me
have her?

469
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:30,442
What is going on here?

470
00:40:30,527 --> 00:40:34,122
He married her to a merchant.

471
00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:37,199
- I shall kill myself.
- I too.

472
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:41,962
Stop drinking and get
some sleep!

473
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,804
You all but complain.

474
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:05,766
I am the Millennial Bee.

475
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,844
I know everything
about your forefathers,

476
00:41:07,927 --> 00:41:11,078
about you and will know
about your children,

477
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:14,159
about your grandchildren
and great grandchildren.

478
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:19,635
Why do you not marry me?

479
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:23,720
No, I want Maria!

480
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:27,800
I shall take an axe
and kill them all.

481
00:41:28,847 --> 00:41:34,080
Use your head instead.

482
00:41:35,127 --> 00:41:38,915
Remember, you are a builder.

483
00:41:47,407 --> 00:41:49,523
A builder...

484
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,599
He has walled her in.

485
00:41:52,687 --> 00:41:54,086
You brought her up badly!

486
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:56,158
She is innocent!

487
00:41:59,047 --> 00:42:01,038
Kiss me, let them see it.

488
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:03,516
Shall I punch you out?

489
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:07,441
Go tell it to the marines.

490
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:09,366
You have led me on!

491
00:42:09,447 --> 00:42:11,438
It is the heathen Pichanda
who is responsible!

492
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:14,121
Come out, or I'll drown you
like mice.

493
00:42:17,887 --> 00:42:20,276
My mother will never forgive us.

494
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:23,359
Die there!

495
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:27,199
Stop crying, Maria.

496
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:39,844
This is how my son, the Bee,
got his bride.

497
00:42:48,687 --> 00:42:53,078
A month later there were
two weddings in the family.

498
00:42:53,727 --> 00:42:59,996
Kristina married Matej,
and Samo married Maria.

499
00:43:00,727 --> 00:43:03,321
Keep an eye on him.

500
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:07,798
I am an easy-going guy.

501
00:43:14,847 --> 00:43:17,281
- And what about you?
- He gave me a fan.

502
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:23,078
My mother's grandmother
and your grandmother's mother

503
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,442
were cousins.

504
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,719
Well, will you join us
on the railway?

505
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:33,197
No. I prefer to be a bricklayer.

506
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:36,962
On the railway you get
regular pay.

507
00:43:37,527 --> 00:43:41,156
Other people would be glad.
Children will come...

508
00:43:41,247 --> 00:43:44,364
When bricking, I earn as much
as on the railway in a year!

509
00:43:44,447 --> 00:43:48,440
You do look pretty!
Drunk into a stupor!

510
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:53,681
You will not leave anymore.
The stories with the whales...

511
00:44:03,447 --> 00:44:04,516
What do you want?

512
00:44:04,607 --> 00:44:07,679
You should not have married him.

513
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:11,640
After all, one day
you will be mine.

514
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:32,039
If you do not catch me,
I will not want you.

515
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:34,756
Why did you not write me?

516
00:44:34,847 --> 00:44:37,645
Have you got another girl?

517
00:44:42,127 --> 00:44:44,641
Kiss me. Do you not love me anymore?

518
00:44:44,727 --> 00:44:47,116
Leave me alone.

519
00:44:49,527 --> 00:44:54,840
All right then, but hurry up,
I am cold.

520
00:44:57,447 --> 00:44:59,039
Oh my God, you are so beautiful!

521
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:03,602
The crazy Hungarian.

522
00:45:07,327 --> 00:45:09,318
You did not give me Maria.

523
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:11,477
But I will find a woman for me.

524
00:45:12,567 --> 00:45:15,877
Do you think you have won?

525
00:45:16,007 --> 00:45:17,804
What do you want, Belan?

526
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:20,366
Mr. Belanyi for you!

527
00:45:20,447 --> 00:45:25,441
Take it easy! Have a drink!

528
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:32,037
I shall castrate all who fail
to give Hungary sons.

529
00:45:32,127 --> 00:45:34,118
- Me too?
- You too.

530
00:45:34,207 --> 00:45:35,925
- And yourself?
- Myself too.

531
00:45:36,007 --> 00:45:38,999
Go ahead. Show you are a man!

532
00:45:39,087 --> 00:45:42,079
I will. Where is my sabre?

533
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:45,159
You had none.

534
00:45:45,247 --> 00:45:48,239
The Belanyis will die out.

535
00:45:49,367 --> 00:45:52,757
You have stolen my wife
and my sabre!

536
00:46:02,647 --> 00:46:04,080
My thumb!

537
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,525
Pity he missed.

538
00:46:06,607 --> 00:46:08,120
He might have made an ox
out of a bull.

539
00:46:08,207 --> 00:46:10,482
For Heaven's sake,
I am bleeding!

540
00:46:15,407 --> 00:46:16,760
You scoundrels!

541
00:46:16,847 --> 00:46:18,678
Are you tired of life? Go home!

542
00:46:18,767 --> 00:46:21,520
- Who are you?
- Jan Pichanda.

543
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:23,965
Matej, your nephew is here!

544
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,766
Janko, stop crying!

545
00:46:26,847 --> 00:46:28,326
Let me see how many you have.

546
00:46:28,407 --> 00:46:32,685
I am to pick more for you
than you can eat.

547
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:36,680
And where is Samo, your father?

548
00:46:36,767 --> 00:46:38,519
On the railway.

549
00:46:38,607 --> 00:46:42,202
- Some for Aunt Kristina too.
- Yes, for Kristina too.

550
00:46:44,487 --> 00:46:46,762
If we got the eight-hour
working day,

551
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:48,644
you would be at home
with your young wife now.

552
00:46:48,727 --> 00:46:50,479
At least this is what could
open your eyes.

553
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:55,038
Why should I criticize the people
who feed me?

554
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:57,044
Do they?

555
00:46:58,087 --> 00:46:59,281
That is only the beginning.

556
00:46:59,367 --> 00:47:02,564
Then the rise in your wages
and pension will come.

557
00:47:02,647 --> 00:47:05,844
And when you are ill,
you will get money.

558
00:47:05,927 --> 00:47:09,920
- Do you employ anybody?
- Anybody who is one of us!

559
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:12,842
What is it on your head?

560
00:47:13,607 --> 00:47:16,917
Our cows allows only my wife
to be milked,

561
00:47:17,007 --> 00:47:19,362
so when she is out,

562
00:47:20,327 --> 00:47:23,319
I must deceive the cow
in this way.

563
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:26,922
Are you trying to deceive me too?

564
00:47:27,007 --> 00:47:30,795
Here, read it and think of it.

565
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:38,558
We must have a child.

566
00:47:40,767 --> 00:47:42,598
It is so sad without children here.

567
00:47:42,687 --> 00:47:46,441
You know it does not work.
We can adopt one.

568
00:47:47,247 --> 00:47:50,239
No. I want my own child!

569
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,358
Our child!

570
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:53,842
Wait...

571
00:47:53,927 --> 00:47:56,395
Have you seen my Julo?

572
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:24,165
Strawberries in the winter.
Who was?

573
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:47,880
The last day of December 1899 arrived.

574
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:51,846
On the last day of the 19th century.

575
00:48:51,927 --> 00:48:54,646
I parted with my pipe.

576
00:48:54,727 --> 00:48:59,118
No fire or time has touched it so far.

577
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:05,199
It is midnight.
The New Year is here.

578
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:10,160
Father, a new pipe.

579
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:13,764
You may smoke in the new century.

580
00:49:13,847 --> 00:49:16,042
It will certainly survive me.

581
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:19,722
- A happy New Year, Father.
- A happy New Year, son.

582
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,436
A happy New Year, Mother.

583
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:24,843
To you too.

584
00:49:24,927 --> 00:49:27,919
I wish you good luck, Maria.

585
00:49:29,047 --> 00:49:32,039
And you, my dear,
change your ways!

586
00:49:32,127 --> 00:49:33,526
Oh, young men...

587
00:49:33,607 --> 00:49:34,756
They will wake the children up.

588
00:49:34,927 --> 00:49:38,317
A new era! New times!

589
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:43,357
They are in a sound sleep.

590
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:48,760
- This will be their century.
- What will it bring?

591
00:49:48,847 --> 00:49:52,442
It must be better than ours.

592
00:49:58,687 --> 00:50:01,155
The best that has ever been.

593
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:33,517
To the century of fraternity,
equality and liberty!

594
00:50:33,927 --> 00:50:37,044
Valent wants to make us all equal!

595
00:50:37,127 --> 00:50:39,687
Why do you think I study law?

596
00:50:42,567 --> 00:50:45,081
Long live freedom!
Long live socialism!

597
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:51,000
Gentlemen, I drink to love.

598
00:50:53,927 --> 00:50:55,360
Liduska...

599
00:50:55,447 --> 00:50:58,166
I have been looking for you.

600
00:50:58,247 --> 00:50:59,236
A parcel for you.

601
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:02,125
The parcel belongs to all!

602
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:06,205
- Who is it?
- A fool.

603
00:51:06,727 --> 00:51:10,720
Help yourselves,
genuine Slovak cheese!

604
00:51:12,127 --> 00:51:14,197
Why have you brought it here?

605
00:51:14,287 --> 00:51:17,882
I could not stay at home alone.

606
00:51:17,967 --> 00:51:20,959
All right. Shall we dance?

607
00:51:21,407 --> 00:51:22,840
Leave some to us too!

608
00:51:22,927 --> 00:51:26,522
Here is a letter.
Let us read it aloud!

609
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:30,601
In this way, damage bypassed us.

610
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,076
But it did not bypass
the old Ondrej Nader.

611
00:51:33,167 --> 00:51:36,079
"Nader's son, Jozef,
who loved the pretty Jewess,

612
00:51:36,167 --> 00:51:40,160
suddenly disappeared
and was found

613
00:51:40,247 --> 00:51:45,037
hanged in the smokehouse
between sausages.

614
00:51:45,127 --> 00:51:49,803
He was black like a native
Malagasy.

615
00:51:52,847 --> 00:51:53,996
Let us take down a statement.

616
00:51:54,087 --> 00:51:56,476
Will you help me?

617
00:51:58,287 --> 00:52:02,280
Jozko, what have you?

618
00:52:02,567 --> 00:52:04,842
No one else has died

619
00:52:04,927 --> 00:52:07,236
and no young girl
has been raped.

620
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:13,564
Have a good time
and come home soon.

621
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:17,562
Sincerely yours
Father and the whole family.

622
00:52:17,887 --> 00:52:20,526
Best regards from Hanka.

623
00:52:21,087 --> 00:52:23,476
Who is Hanka?

624
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:28,997
My six-year old niece.

625
00:52:29,087 --> 00:52:30,964
But you wrote her. Do not lie.

626
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:35,438
- He who lies...
- He... what?

627
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:42,365
Oh my God, you are
so beautiful...

628
00:52:56,327 --> 00:52:59,285
Gently... gently...

629
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:08,366
Oh my Slovak man.

630
00:53:14,727 --> 00:53:19,084
Come here, my little one.

631
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:32,118
He is hungry.

632
00:53:37,367 --> 00:53:40,086
We are getting old,

633
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:42,556
it is time to think
of our eternal salvation.

634
00:53:42,647 --> 00:53:44,399
We go to confession on Saturday.

635
00:53:48,807 --> 00:53:50,798
Shall we buy him?

636
00:53:50,887 --> 00:53:56,200
Jano has taken the scythe
away from me!

637
00:53:56,887 --> 00:54:02,359
Do not worry,
you will not be sold.

638
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:05,561
Did you hear me, you old
cunning fox?

639
00:54:05,647 --> 00:54:12,644
I do not wish such a pain
even to my worst enemy.

640
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:15,956
I have terrible rheumatics
in my knee.

641
00:54:16,047 --> 00:54:17,878
Hurry up, Martin!

642
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:22,563
Do you not see I cannot bend
my knee?

643
00:54:23,047 --> 00:54:25,083
You are not going then, are you?

644
00:54:25,607 --> 00:54:30,601
I would not be able to kneel
and do not want to embarrass you.

645
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:40,161
You are so proud
that you will come to a bad end.

646
00:54:49,367 --> 00:54:52,962
Come closer.

647
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:59,485
The comrade Karoly is to speak

648
00:54:59,567 --> 00:55:05,563
about the resolutions passed
by the Socialist Congress in Paris.

649
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:25,355
We do not understand Hungarian!

650
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:33,561
The representatives of nine
socialist parties in Paris.

651
00:55:42,487 --> 00:55:45,559
Stop it! This is our common cause!

652
00:55:47,087 --> 00:55:50,284
Biro, go up there and translate.

653
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:54,040
Quiet! He is going to translate!

654
00:55:54,127 --> 00:55:57,722
I speak Slovak. Silence!

655
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:21,281
The proletariats' demands
formulated by Jaurais

656
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:23,835
are based on the following points:

657
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:33,564
an eight-hour working day,

658
00:56:39,887 --> 00:56:44,278
a ban on the child labour,

659
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:48,364
a fixed minimum wage
for workers,

660
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:53,840
because we all depend
on their labour.

661
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:38,557
Welcome, Fathers.

662
00:57:38,767 --> 00:57:42,362
You seem to avoid the church,
so I have come to see you.

663
00:57:42,687 --> 00:57:47,283
We must have a serious talk.

664
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:53,444
Then let us go to the bee-house.
It is a quiet place.

665
00:57:53,927 --> 00:57:58,398
Some pests have been damaging
the crops.

666
00:58:02,047 --> 00:58:05,437
- What is this?
- Nothing for you, Reverends.

667
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:07,199
Oh, Pichanda, Pichanda...

668
00:58:07,287 --> 00:58:10,279
I have never seen you
in the confessional.

669
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:14,565
You care for the crops
but not for your soul.

670
00:58:14,727 --> 00:58:17,525
Have a swig, Fathers.

671
00:58:17,607 --> 00:58:22,601
But let me ask you something

672
00:58:24,207 --> 00:58:27,199
as both of you are here.

673
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:33,160
Christians live here,

674
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:37,237
and Muslims here.

675
00:58:37,767 --> 00:58:43,558
There are Buddhists, and there Hindus.

676
00:58:43,967 --> 00:58:49,360
All believe in their own god.

677
00:58:49,687 --> 00:58:53,760
Which of them is the right one?

678
00:58:53,847 --> 00:58:55,838
There is the only God.

679
00:58:55,927 --> 00:59:01,923
I think the truth is
in the middle

680
00:59:03,167 --> 00:59:05,886
like the sting of the bee.

681
00:59:05,967 --> 00:59:08,640
The truth is in each human.

682
00:59:08,727 --> 00:59:10,604
You and your philosophising!

683
00:59:10,687 --> 00:59:14,043
But your wine is excellent.
And the colour!

684
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:22,759
With this wine here
we can settle my confession.

685
00:59:23,967 --> 00:59:26,356
A game of cards?

686
00:59:26,447 --> 00:59:28,836
Preferans?

687
00:59:29,327 --> 00:59:32,205
For a penny?

688
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:46,362
The old wizard made them drunk.

689
00:59:55,687 --> 00:59:58,679
What have you for me?

690
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:21,235
They are carrying him in.

691
01:00:49,967 --> 01:00:51,923
Matej!

692
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:56,202
- It is me, Julo Mitron.
- What do you want?

693
01:00:56,287 --> 01:00:59,723
- I cannot live without you.
- You have a wife.

694
01:00:59,807 --> 01:01:02,367
I do not want her.

695
01:01:04,767 --> 01:01:07,964
She has given me no children.

696
01:01:08,087 --> 01:01:10,840
I have none either.
Yet I live on.

697
01:01:12,607 --> 01:01:17,203
I have been thinking of you
for ten years.

698
01:01:17,887 --> 01:01:21,880
Waiting for something to happen.

699
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:28,957
When you got married
I almost died.

700
01:01:31,967 --> 01:01:34,162
God forgive me.

701
01:01:34,367 --> 01:01:37,359
When he was killed in the woods,

702
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:41,838
my inner voice said:

703
01:01:41,927 --> 01:01:44,919
You deserved that.

704
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:53,764
You should not have married her.

705
01:01:57,287 --> 01:01:59,278
Go away.

706
01:02:01,967 --> 01:02:04,561
I shall leave Matilda.

707
01:02:10,567 --> 01:02:14,958
Or I shall kill her
or you shall be mine.

708
01:02:20,247 --> 01:02:23,239
Do not cry.

709
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:30,125
Here, for you. Do not forget me.

710
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,485
I will not.

711
01:02:48,607 --> 01:02:51,405
Mother, your son is home!

712
01:02:55,367 --> 01:02:57,005
Welcome, Valent.

713
01:02:57,087 --> 01:02:59,726
Do you like lollipops?

714
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:04,042
There are so many children here!

715
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:06,597
Valent is here!

716
01:03:07,087 --> 01:03:10,682
Samo, you have got a moustache.

717
01:03:11,367 --> 01:03:14,120
And you a bow-tie.

718
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:20,478
Valent, it is nice of you.

719
01:03:20,567 --> 01:03:24,560
Australia... and it is new.

720
01:03:28,367 --> 01:03:30,403
How are the things in Prague?

721
01:03:30,487 --> 01:03:32,478
Pretty lively, Father.

722
01:03:32,567 --> 01:03:34,717
Is there going to be
a revolution?

723
01:03:34,807 --> 01:03:38,686
The world has to be built
before it can be torn down.

724
01:03:38,767 --> 01:03:42,760
We do not want to tear it down,
we are builders.

725
01:03:44,407 --> 01:03:46,318
Sir,

726
01:03:47,207 --> 01:03:51,120
my gracious master invites you.

727
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:54,756
What a handsome gentleman
you are.

728
01:04:08,247 --> 01:04:10,841
Go to the kitchen.

729
01:04:12,127 --> 01:04:17,326
I have capital and experience,

730
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:21,605
you are educated and have
a keen mind.

731
01:04:23,767 --> 01:04:30,366
The factory is extending
production

732
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:35,643
and the old Wikelhofer has
offered me partnership.

733
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:40,365
I would like you to join me
in business.

734
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,642
But I have not got a penny.

735
01:04:42,767 --> 01:04:47,761
I can lend you, I trust you.

736
01:04:48,207 --> 01:04:50,596
When shall I pay you back?

737
01:04:51,567 --> 01:04:57,358
You invest five thousand
and get ten thousand back.

738
01:04:57,567 --> 01:05:03,164
Then you invest ten thousand,
and will get fifty thousand.

739
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:06,162
Then you will pay me back.

740
01:05:06,847 --> 01:05:11,443
Or the things can develop
in such a way

741
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:16,883
that you will never have
to pay me back.

742
01:05:21,087 --> 01:05:23,601
So late?

743
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:26,679
This is the third time
I have been here today.

744
01:05:27,087 --> 01:05:29,476
Sorry, I was busy.

745
01:05:32,567 --> 01:05:34,398
I know, you were
at Haderpan's place.

746
01:05:34,487 --> 01:05:36,079
You will stay at home now,
won't you?

747
01:05:36,167 --> 01:05:38,886
I do not know.

748
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:44,919
Everything is getting
more complicated.

749
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:50,001
I must serve people,
you know, justice.

750
01:05:50,087 --> 01:05:53,079
I am a lawyer.

751
01:05:54,127 --> 01:05:58,325
Are lawyers not allowed to love?

752
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:03,437
- Now? Here?
- Kiss me.

753
01:06:03,967 --> 01:06:07,846
I love you.
You are still beautiful.

754
01:06:07,927 --> 01:06:10,919
Give me a hug.

755
01:06:17,567 --> 01:06:18,602
God forgive me.

756
01:06:57,767 --> 01:06:59,803
Poor children...

757
01:07:00,847 --> 01:07:03,919
- Your mother saw us.
- Never mind.

758
01:07:05,767 --> 01:07:09,555
You are divine,
better than others.

759
01:07:09,887 --> 01:07:12,481
So you do love me after all.

760
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:19,360
You will be a businessman,
after all.

761
01:07:19,727 --> 01:07:22,719
I have not decided yet.

762
01:07:23,687 --> 01:07:29,637
I must discuss with you first.

763
01:07:29,727 --> 01:07:33,322
You do not need our advice.

764
01:07:33,567 --> 01:07:37,082
You have already made
a decision.

765
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:40,955
- They will want you to get married.
- I shall not marry Hermina.

766
01:07:46,367 --> 01:07:50,485
Do you want to make me drunk?
I can stand much.

767
01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:54,558
We shall see.

768
01:07:54,887 --> 01:07:59,085
Do you want to seduce me
with this?

769
01:08:04,367 --> 01:08:07,086
Show me what it hides!

770
01:08:07,967 --> 01:08:09,958
Let go of me!

771
01:08:12,767 --> 01:08:15,156
Sorry.

772
01:08:15,367 --> 01:08:17,278
I know you do not love me.

773
01:08:17,367 --> 01:08:20,962
I have been loving you
for a long time.

774
01:08:28,367 --> 01:08:31,962
I am still a virgin.

775
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:35,559
Oh God, you are so beautiful.

776
01:08:37,567 --> 01:08:39,956
I feel embarrassed
when you are looking at me.

777
01:08:44,767 --> 01:08:49,557
Friends, our efforts,
our skills,

778
01:08:49,647 --> 01:08:52,115
and our money are changing
the world.

779
01:08:52,207 --> 01:08:56,200
If we defend our capital well,
we shall become a great nation.

780
01:08:56,287 --> 01:08:58,755
Toast to my wife, Hermina.

781
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:01,839
I hope she will defend me.

782
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:17,562
May I have this dance?

783
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:21,159
That is nothing for us.

784
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:31,761
Good-bye, freedom!

785
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:34,959
My dear children,
you go together well.

786
01:09:36,207 --> 01:09:38,596
I never dreamt of this.

787
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:43,483
They will get along well, Martin.

788
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:49,957
I have rented a house for them
where they can bill and coo.

789
01:09:50,047 --> 01:09:53,357
Let us hope so.

790
01:09:54,327 --> 01:09:58,320
May a dove fly over your nest,

791
01:09:58,967 --> 01:10:01,322
May you make love full of zest.

792
01:10:01,407 --> 01:10:05,195
Here is a golden crown for bride,

793
01:10:06,287 --> 01:10:10,200
The groom is full of pride.

794
01:10:10,767 --> 01:10:14,680
May a bonnie child arrive one day,
This is what I wish to say.

795
01:10:15,567 --> 01:10:17,205
Sacrilege!

796
01:10:17,287 --> 01:10:21,360
You have pinched the crown
from the church!

797
01:10:21,447 --> 01:10:24,245
From the statue of Virgin Mary!

798
01:10:27,167 --> 01:10:32,366
You will burn in hell!

799
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:36,958
Valent is right, times are rough.

800
01:10:37,287 --> 01:10:42,486
The young blood is needed
to cope with this world.

801
01:10:42,967 --> 01:10:47,563
If I had your money
I would discover another America.

802
01:10:47,647 --> 01:10:52,437
I can lend you.
Go and discover a rich island.

803
01:10:52,847 --> 01:10:56,442
I will buy it then.
How much do you need?

804
01:10:56,687 --> 01:10:59,281
What did you say?

805
01:10:59,567 --> 01:11:03,958
I cannot hear a thing.
It is that buzzing.

806
01:11:04,047 --> 01:11:07,357
When it does not suit him,
he is deaf.

807
01:11:07,967 --> 01:11:11,357
I really cannot hear anything.

808
01:11:30,367 --> 01:11:32,164
The sea.

809
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:38,157
The men keep chasing you,
Kristina.

810
01:11:42,367 --> 01:11:44,358
I can see it.

811
01:11:44,447 --> 01:11:46,165
I live an honest life.

812
01:11:46,247 --> 01:11:52,243
You need a man, a husband.

813
01:11:52,847 --> 01:11:54,838
I am fine alone.

814
01:11:54,967 --> 01:11:59,165
I know a good, pious man.

815
01:11:59,247 --> 01:12:02,045
- Who?
- Dropa, the Barber.

816
01:12:02,967 --> 01:12:05,606
The old Barber?

817
01:12:06,767 --> 01:12:11,761
He lives alone as you do.

818
01:12:12,167 --> 01:12:15,557
A young widow invites sin.

819
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:20,759
I shall find a way for you!

820
01:12:22,967 --> 01:12:26,960
And you, stop pretending to be deaf.
She must get married!

821
01:12:29,367 --> 01:12:35,363
The eve of St. Vincent's Day,
1905, was very cold.

822
01:12:41,007 --> 01:12:45,319
Even while writing my fingers
are numb.

823
01:12:46,687 --> 01:12:50,600
I was listening to the bees
in the hive.

824
01:12:50,727 --> 01:12:52,319
They are still alive.

825
01:12:52,687 --> 01:12:54,200
Incredible!

826
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:56,642
Zanzibar, have you ever seen
anything like this?

827
01:12:56,727 --> 01:12:59,719
Frozen!

828
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:09,166
Why is Slovakia not
on the equator?

829
01:13:15,567 --> 01:13:17,717
Black beasts.

830
01:13:27,887 --> 01:13:30,959
The wine is frozen.

831
01:13:31,047 --> 01:13:33,561
Do not catch a chill, Samo.

832
01:13:33,647 --> 01:13:36,559
Work keeps me warm.

833
01:13:36,647 --> 01:13:41,243
I am frozen to the bones.

834
01:13:44,767 --> 01:13:45,995
What is wrong with the dog?

835
01:13:47,487 --> 01:13:50,479
It has frozen too.

836
01:14:05,687 --> 01:14:08,076
This is hard too.

837
01:14:16,967 --> 01:14:20,755
They never shut the windows.

838
01:14:29,487 --> 01:14:31,796
Wine...

839
01:14:39,167 --> 01:14:41,920
It is warming me up.

840
01:15:08,567 --> 01:15:10,922
What is the old wizard doing?

841
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:14,397
Go upstairs, children.

842
01:15:17,567 --> 01:15:20,445
Grandpa has fallen down!

843
01:15:23,887 --> 01:15:26,481
- Father!
- Oh my God, what happened?

844
01:15:26,567 --> 01:15:29,957
- Blood!
- That is wine.

845
01:15:30,047 --> 01:15:31,560
He has swallowed a piece
of glass.

846
01:15:31,687 --> 01:15:36,807
What happened? He is not breathing!
For Christ's sake!

847
01:15:37,047 --> 01:15:39,436
Come, Mom.

848
01:15:42,367 --> 01:15:47,361
My poor old man!

849
01:15:49,567 --> 01:15:53,276
Zanzibar!

850
01:15:55,967 --> 01:15:58,959
His track ends here.

851
01:15:59,367 --> 01:16:01,676
He could not have disappeared.

852
01:16:04,447 --> 01:16:06,039
Maybe he followed grandpa
up there.

853
01:16:06,127 --> 01:16:08,436
Up there?

854
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:14,159
Where is he laid out?

855
01:16:24,087 --> 01:16:26,237
You were a good chap.

856
01:16:26,327 --> 01:16:32,721
Too bad you have gone so early.

857
01:16:35,447 --> 01:16:39,440
You led us all over Hungary,

858
01:16:41,047 --> 01:16:43,481
as far as to Vienna.

859
01:16:43,567 --> 01:16:47,560
Do you remember when he set out
for Debrecen

860
01:16:47,647 --> 01:16:49,239
and ended up with his girlfriend?

861
01:16:49,327 --> 01:16:52,478
In the bowels of a whale.

862
01:16:52,567 --> 01:16:59,803
Our Martin seems to have grown
now that he is dead.

863
01:17:00,087 --> 01:17:04,285
The coffin is too small.

864
01:17:04,367 --> 01:17:08,360
He has grown in it,
has become larger.

865
01:17:10,447 --> 01:17:13,120
He was as tall as I.

866
01:17:13,567 --> 01:17:18,402
In the army we were
the same size.

867
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:22,156
If I had something to measure...

868
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:29,159
Without the shoes!

869
01:17:30,447 --> 01:17:33,439
Watch if someone is coming.

870
01:17:39,167 --> 01:17:41,727
- What happened?
- It jumped out.

871
01:17:42,007 --> 01:17:45,636
As I said, he has grown taller.

872
01:17:46,447 --> 01:17:50,156
Somebody may grow after he dies.

873
01:17:50,247 --> 01:17:52,636
Life kept pressing him down,

874
01:17:52,727 --> 01:17:58,040
now that he is dead,
he is relaxing and stretching.

875
01:17:58,287 --> 01:18:00,881
Stop chattering!

876
01:18:02,487 --> 01:18:04,876
Go to the door!

877
01:18:07,647 --> 01:18:09,080
Someone is coming! Hurry up!

878
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:11,397
For Heaven's sake,
let us run away!

879
01:18:11,487 --> 01:18:14,479
Through the window!

880
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:16,806
Hold!

881
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:25,199
Have a drink in father's memory.

882
01:18:28,967 --> 01:18:31,162
To his health.

883
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:08,563
- We worried you would not come.
- I am a busy man.

884
01:20:09,527 --> 01:20:12,087
Did he mention me
before he died?

885
01:20:12,167 --> 01:20:13,156
He died alone.

886
01:20:13,247 --> 01:20:16,842
Alone? How could you?

887
01:20:27,287 --> 01:20:31,565
Slow down, we are going downhill!

888
01:20:33,887 --> 01:20:38,403
The coffin is sliding down!

889
01:20:38,607 --> 01:20:41,201
I cannot hold it any longer!

890
01:21:03,087 --> 01:21:04,884
Stop!

891
01:21:14,967 --> 01:21:18,357
Father does not want to go
to the grave.

892
01:21:21,047 --> 01:21:25,757
If the stream was not frozen
it could take him to the sea.

893
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:29,237
Maybe as far as Madagascar.

894
01:21:33,967 --> 01:21:39,360
Mother should keep the house
and a part of the land.

895
01:21:39,687 --> 01:21:43,282
We can share the rest.

896
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:46,044
As you think.

897
01:21:46,127 --> 01:21:51,645
You have four children.
You can rent my part.

898
01:21:51,727 --> 01:21:57,120
You will pay me back
when you have money.

899
01:21:57,887 --> 01:22:00,276
Thanks.

900
01:22:01,287 --> 01:22:04,882
- And you, Kristina?
- I need nothing.

901
01:22:07,167 --> 01:22:10,159
Matej left me enough.

902
01:22:10,567 --> 01:22:14,560
Wait, I will see you home.

903
01:22:15,047 --> 01:22:21,043
I hear Hanka is expect...

904
01:22:21,527 --> 01:22:26,920
Could you give her money
from me?

905
01:22:27,007 --> 01:22:30,602
You have to do it yourself.
Or have you lost courage?

906
01:22:36,967 --> 01:22:38,366
What do you want?

907
01:22:38,447 --> 01:22:41,041
Had I known you were
expecting...

908
01:22:41,127 --> 01:22:44,802
No! No!

909
01:22:45,087 --> 01:22:48,875
I will support you both.

910
01:22:49,767 --> 01:22:52,964
The child will not have
a father.

911
01:22:53,367 --> 01:22:58,361
I will bring it up myself.

912
01:22:59,167 --> 01:23:01,158
Go away!

913
01:23:01,247 --> 01:23:03,442
I hate you!

914
01:23:03,527 --> 01:23:06,280
I only wanted to help.

915
01:23:16,167 --> 01:23:21,560
I had better be dead
and not to have met you.

916
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:07,158
God almighty! What is this?

917
01:24:10,607 --> 01:24:13,917
A fallen star, I guess.

918
01:24:21,887 --> 01:24:23,479
Damn it!

919
01:24:24,847 --> 01:24:27,839
It is hot!

920
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:34,759
It is iron.

921
01:24:44,207 --> 01:24:47,005
Nothing!

922
01:24:49,367 --> 01:24:51,358
It is hard.

923
01:25:00,767 --> 01:25:03,156
Go to bed.

924
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:09,562
I know where you have been.
With Kristina!

925
01:25:10,767 --> 01:25:14,840
I prefer to poison you
not to suffer!

926
01:25:14,927 --> 01:25:16,724
What nonsense is it?

927
01:25:16,807 --> 01:25:19,605
I did not mean it!

928
01:25:20,367 --> 01:25:22,961
Do not be cross.

929
01:25:23,567 --> 01:25:27,560
Julo... I love you.

930
01:25:56,367 --> 01:25:58,756
Where have you been?

931
01:26:01,967 --> 01:26:04,401
They want to marry me off.

932
01:26:04,487 --> 01:26:06,876
You must not get married.

933
01:26:07,367 --> 01:26:12,760
If Matilda and I had children,
I might leave you in peace.

934
01:26:18,167 --> 01:26:21,364
Look, what I brought you.

935
01:26:22,167 --> 01:26:25,159
A heart.

936
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:32,362
I have forged it from a star.

937
01:26:32,447 --> 01:26:35,041
Salty.

938
01:26:41,367 --> 01:26:43,961
Dear Kristina,

939
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:48,320
we are meant for each other.

940
01:26:56,967 --> 01:27:02,360
Julo, my Julo...

941
01:27:24,167 --> 01:27:26,283
This is the last one.

942
01:27:26,367 --> 01:27:29,245
Drink, men, Belanyi pays today.

943
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:32,319
What do you need so many
horseshoes for?

944
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,158
You will never be able to wear
them out

945
01:27:37,247 --> 01:27:39,636
even if you put them
on your own hands and feet.

946
01:27:39,767 --> 01:27:43,157
I shall shoe a regiment.

947
01:27:43,247 --> 01:27:46,922
Yet there will be one left
for your mouth.

948
01:27:47,007 --> 01:27:50,283
Better save two
for Austria-Hungary.

949
01:27:50,367 --> 01:27:52,961
The empire has been hobbling.

950
01:27:53,047 --> 01:27:56,835
Will you, the Hungarian yeoman,
put up with that?

951
01:27:57,967 --> 01:28:00,959
The bell tolls for you, socialists.

952
01:28:01,047 --> 01:28:03,242
We shall not spare any.

953
01:28:05,567 --> 01:28:09,560
I am shaking with fear.

954
01:28:09,647 --> 01:28:15,165
Six hundred sixty horseshoes
make forty-six guldens.

955
01:28:15,247 --> 01:28:18,637
All right.
Put one gulden more.

956
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:20,718
Wait!

957
01:28:20,807 --> 01:28:23,401
Do not worry, blacksmith,

958
01:28:23,487 --> 01:28:26,160
the army will pay
for everything.

959
01:28:26,247 --> 01:28:29,637
That was not the deal!

960
01:28:31,967 --> 01:28:35,562
Is the word of a Hungarian gentleman
not good enough for you?

961
01:28:35,647 --> 01:28:37,126
We cannot eat words.

962
01:28:37,207 --> 01:28:41,359
If you have no money, get off!

963
01:28:42,767 --> 01:28:46,157
Have you gone mad, blacksmith?

964
01:28:46,567 --> 01:28:49,286
Who do you think you are opposing?
Load the goods!

965
01:28:49,367 --> 01:28:51,483
Look out, Palo!

966
01:28:51,567 --> 01:28:54,161
Here is your helmet!

967
01:28:58,367 --> 01:29:02,155
I shall show you who is
the master in this land!

968
01:29:09,767 --> 01:29:12,361
Greedy lot!

969
01:29:14,287 --> 01:29:16,403
You will pay for this!
I shall denounce you!

970
01:29:16,967 --> 01:29:19,959
What will happen if he does so?

971
01:29:22,367 --> 01:29:24,198
He would not live to see
another day.

972
01:29:29,367 --> 01:29:31,562
The police are coming!

973
01:29:31,647 --> 01:29:34,445
Let us run to the brook!

974
01:29:35,567 --> 01:29:37,637
Come back!

975
01:29:37,727 --> 01:29:41,163
Run away, they beat everybody!

976
01:29:41,967 --> 01:29:43,958
Here we are.

977
01:29:44,247 --> 01:29:46,841
Police!

978
01:29:48,567 --> 01:29:51,365
They are approaching the mill!

979
01:29:51,767 --> 01:29:52,483
Hurry up and tell your father!

980
01:29:52,567 --> 01:29:54,956
Let us hurry up home!

981
01:29:55,047 --> 01:29:57,436
The Hungarian bastard!

982
01:29:57,527 --> 01:29:59,040
I am back at night!

983
01:29:59,367 --> 01:30:03,155
Do not look back!

984
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,956
This is my death-bed.

985
01:30:10,967 --> 01:30:12,958
I have not done anything bad!

986
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:15,927
I am innocent!

987
01:30:16,007 --> 01:30:18,885
Policemen!

988
01:30:18,967 --> 01:30:20,241
With sabres!

989
01:30:24,367 --> 01:30:27,359
He has done nothing bad.

990
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:32,238
What is going on here?

991
01:30:35,367 --> 01:30:39,360
You have done nothing bad,
they must set you free.

992
01:30:40,567 --> 01:30:41,966
Let him be!

993
01:30:42,047 --> 01:30:44,038
Daddy!

994
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:48,886
Now you stopped laughing
on the other side of your face.

995
01:30:48,967 --> 01:30:50,559
I will pray for you!

996
01:30:50,647 --> 01:30:53,207
Your buzzing has stopped,
you bee of Pichanda!

997
01:30:54,167 --> 01:31:00,163
You think you can act as if you were
on familiar terms with the emperor!

998
01:31:00,767 --> 01:31:02,723
I do not understand.

999
01:31:02,807 --> 01:31:04,604
Speak Hungarian!

1000
01:31:06,367 --> 01:31:10,360
Are you a Social Democrat?

1001
01:31:10,967 --> 01:31:13,765
Yes, I am. Is it illegal?

1002
01:31:13,847 --> 01:31:16,236
It is not,

1003
01:31:16,367 --> 01:31:21,157
but you have insulted
His Majesty,

1004
01:31:21,247 --> 01:31:24,637
the Austro-Hungarian emperor.

1005
01:31:26,767 --> 01:31:32,319
It counts as conspiring
to incite a riot.

1006
01:31:32,407 --> 01:31:34,602
What riot?

1007
01:31:34,687 --> 01:31:36,643
You bully working people.

1008
01:31:36,727 --> 01:31:40,117
Sit down!

1009
01:31:42,167 --> 01:31:45,159
Shut up! You are impudent!

1010
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:48,956
My eye...

1011
01:31:50,447 --> 01:31:52,836
Who could have thought?

1012
01:31:53,167 --> 01:31:55,761
Bloody Hungarian shorty!

1013
01:31:55,847 --> 01:31:58,361
He would let us hanged
for a couple of horseshoes.

1014
01:31:58,447 --> 01:32:01,598
You must keep to this theory.

1015
01:32:01,687 --> 01:32:04,076
Deny all the rest.

1016
01:32:04,167 --> 01:32:08,160
It was a row over horseshoes,
no political statements.

1017
01:32:08,967 --> 01:32:12,960
Belanyi has no witness.

1018
01:32:15,567 --> 01:32:19,560
Samo, have you gone mad?

1019
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:22,162
Why do you meddle in politics?

1020
01:32:22,247 --> 01:32:24,966
You should have kept your mouth shut
about the socialists.

1021
01:32:25,047 --> 01:32:27,356
- That is my business.
- Your business?

1022
01:32:27,447 --> 01:32:30,439
You forgot I am a lawyer?

1023
01:32:33,567 --> 01:32:37,606
That I have a high position
and reputation?

1024
01:32:38,567 --> 01:32:42,958
What reputation?
Hanka died during miscarriage.

1025
01:32:44,047 --> 01:32:49,246
I did not know that.

1026
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:55,364
Why are you staring at me?

1027
01:32:55,447 --> 01:32:58,644
I offered her help.

1028
01:32:59,567 --> 01:33:02,286
I will do my best.

1029
01:33:08,167 --> 01:33:10,965
Somebody helped him.

1030
01:33:11,047 --> 01:33:14,039
Do you hold well?

1031
01:33:14,127 --> 01:33:15,355
He is heavy.

1032
01:33:15,447 --> 01:33:17,597
Is that Belanyi?

1033
01:33:17,687 --> 01:33:19,678
Yes, that is him.

1034
01:33:20,167 --> 01:33:23,557
Whose well is it?

1035
01:33:23,647 --> 01:33:25,239
Mitron's.

1036
01:33:25,327 --> 01:33:27,318
He is in prison.

1037
01:33:27,407 --> 01:33:28,396
Who could have done it?

1038
01:33:28,487 --> 01:33:29,966
He asks who it did.

1039
01:33:30,047 --> 01:33:34,040
He must have fallen there himself.
He was always drunk.

1040
01:33:45,887 --> 01:33:48,799
Look, a naked woman!

1041
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:52,198
I have seen such.

1042
01:33:52,287 --> 01:33:54,198
When we were bricking.

1043
01:33:54,287 --> 01:33:55,879
Silence! She is coming.

1044
01:33:55,967 --> 01:34:00,165
My husband is not in
and I have no time for you.

1045
01:34:00,367 --> 01:34:02,562
Is he chasing girls?

1046
01:34:02,647 --> 01:34:05,241
Good morning.

1047
01:34:05,327 --> 01:34:07,045
Welcome, Samo.

1048
01:34:07,127 --> 01:34:09,721
How dirty they are.
Are they robbers?

1049
01:34:09,807 --> 01:34:12,401
No, it is your uncle.

1050
01:34:12,487 --> 01:34:16,878
We came to thank Valent.

1051
01:34:18,967 --> 01:34:22,357
He did not take any actions.

1052
01:34:22,447 --> 01:34:27,043
Belanyi drowned himself.

1053
01:34:29,767 --> 01:34:32,759
Well, we will not keep you long.

1054
01:34:35,167 --> 01:34:36,759
Give our regards to him.

1055
01:34:36,847 --> 01:34:41,443
Samo, you can stay.

1056
01:34:43,767 --> 01:34:45,359
Why do you not sit down?

1057
01:34:45,447 --> 01:34:49,645
Thanks, we had been sitting
long enough.

1058
01:34:49,727 --> 01:34:53,720
Let us dandle it.

1059
01:34:58,367 --> 01:35:00,961
Anosta and Pichanda!

1060
01:35:01,047 --> 01:35:05,040
Give your tools back and leave!

1061
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:09,758
- What is wrong this time?
- You do know very well.

1062
01:35:10,847 --> 01:35:16,046
You foment a rebellion,
and Pichanda was in prison.

1063
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:21,121
You still owe me the last pay.

1064
01:35:21,207 --> 01:35:25,405
Ask your socialists to pay you.

1065
01:35:25,527 --> 01:35:28,917
They will grant you a pension too.

1066
01:35:31,967 --> 01:35:34,959
And here is your pension,
bastard!

1067
01:35:35,967 --> 01:35:39,562
Help! Put me down!

1068
01:35:39,647 --> 01:35:42,639
You are assaulting a public official!

1069
01:35:57,767 --> 01:36:00,565
The yoke is loose.

1070
01:36:05,567 --> 01:36:09,480
- Why do we plough?
- To have grain for bread.

1071
01:36:10,567 --> 01:36:14,560
Plough me in,
I shall turn into cakes.

1072
01:36:20,367 --> 01:36:23,916
Bread is one of man's
best inventions.

1073
01:36:26,567 --> 01:36:28,637
Father, look!

1074
01:36:42,447 --> 01:36:44,244
What is it flying over there?

1075
01:36:44,327 --> 01:36:46,761
- Bats!
- In daylight...

1076
01:36:52,167 --> 01:36:54,123
Catch me one, I shall draw it.

1077
01:36:59,167 --> 01:37:03,558
Do not be frightened.
How pretty you are!

1078
01:37:04,167 --> 01:37:07,557
Karol, draw us, not birds.

1079
01:37:08,167 --> 01:37:09,964
Birds are prettier.

1080
01:37:12,167 --> 01:37:15,557
Have you ever seen
something like this?

1081
01:37:15,647 --> 01:37:19,356
The moths have eaten the bees.

1082
01:37:19,447 --> 01:37:22,166
Strange things have been
happening in the world.

1083
01:37:22,247 --> 01:37:25,637
If it does not rain,
we shall have no bread.

1084
01:37:25,847 --> 01:37:27,565
You are right.

1085
01:37:27,687 --> 01:37:30,997
Have a nice day, Mr. Pichanda.

1086
01:37:31,567 --> 01:37:34,764
Do you know about some work
for bricklayers?

1087
01:37:34,847 --> 01:37:39,841
The situation is very bad.
Try in the Hungarian land.

1088
01:37:39,927 --> 01:37:43,124
And is there going to be a war?

1089
01:37:43,647 --> 01:37:45,956
Three things are needed for it:

1090
01:37:46,047 --> 01:37:50,438
money, dough, and loot.

1091
01:37:51,367 --> 01:37:53,961
Suppose there already is?

1092
01:38:07,967 --> 01:38:12,757
On St. Joseph day, our houses
and fields were flooded.

1093
01:38:12,847 --> 01:38:14,644
I took a washtub

1094
01:38:14,727 --> 01:38:18,037
and went for a row with the
children around our house,

1095
01:38:18,127 --> 01:38:22,917
when our Lord let us have
the sea for a while.

1096
01:38:25,567 --> 01:38:29,082
Oh, the sea...
Where is the water now?

1097
01:38:33,367 --> 01:38:36,359
The men want me to join them
to America.

1098
01:38:36,447 --> 01:38:40,838
Greben and the Fish go
to Pittsburgh.

1099
01:38:42,967 --> 01:38:48,758
I could earn lots of money.

1100
01:38:48,967 --> 01:38:54,758
I shall not let you go.
I would die here without you.

1101
01:38:55,967 --> 01:39:00,165
Your God does not give us rain.

1102
01:39:00,967 --> 01:39:03,765
In America, gold falls
from heaven.

1103
01:39:03,847 --> 01:39:06,839
Not now.

1104
01:39:06,927 --> 01:39:10,920
The baby is on the way.

1105
01:39:12,167 --> 01:39:17,366
- It will be a girl.
- A girl.

1106
01:39:24,367 --> 01:39:26,278
We shall name her Maria.

1107
01:39:30,367 --> 01:39:33,564
The sun set the grain on fire!

1108
01:39:43,767 --> 01:39:47,760
Pichanda's grain is on fire!

1109
01:39:47,847 --> 01:39:50,839
It is raining!

1110
01:40:02,967 --> 01:40:05,765
I am all wet.

1111
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:09,361
Close your eyes.

1112
01:40:15,367 --> 01:40:16,766
You stung me with your nose.

1113
01:40:16,847 --> 01:40:18,838
When I grow up
I will buy you a ring.

1114
01:40:18,927 --> 01:40:22,124
- A genuine gold ring?
- Genuine.

1115
01:40:22,207 --> 01:40:23,606
Lovers, lovers!

1116
01:40:23,687 --> 01:40:26,679
Matilda is going to take a bath.

1117
01:40:30,767 --> 01:40:34,396
Water, water!

1118
01:40:35,567 --> 01:40:39,162
Julo, come!

1119
01:40:47,967 --> 01:40:51,960
Come inside, Matilda!

1120
01:40:52,167 --> 01:40:54,317
Stop making a fool of yourself.

1121
01:40:58,567 --> 01:41:00,125
Something white is falling!

1122
01:41:02,327 --> 01:41:03,760
Ice.

1123
01:41:03,847 --> 01:41:06,839
Hail...

1124
01:41:16,567 --> 01:41:19,161
We complained about the drought

1125
01:41:19,567 --> 01:41:24,163
but then heavy hail
destroyed the little crop we had.

1126
01:41:25,767 --> 01:41:28,964
Many men decided to go
to America.

1127
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:32,044
I made another decision.

1128
01:41:32,767 --> 01:41:37,158
I put together a team of bricklayers
like my father used to

1129
01:41:37,247 --> 01:41:41,240
and we set off to the south.

1130
01:41:45,967 --> 01:41:50,165
This is not our train!

1131
01:41:50,247 --> 01:41:52,158
Americans, get off!

1132
01:41:52,247 --> 01:41:54,966
Which is ours?

1133
01:41:55,047 --> 01:41:57,686
Hurry up! It is moving!

1134
01:42:05,367 --> 01:42:07,961
Daddy, come back!

1135
01:42:21,367 --> 01:42:24,279
My feather has blown away.

1136
01:42:24,367 --> 01:42:26,756
Catch it, Eva!

1137
01:42:26,967 --> 01:42:27,956
Here you are!

1138
01:42:28,047 --> 01:42:29,924
Besides the old ones,

1139
01:42:30,007 --> 01:42:31,565
the Left-hander, the Genius
and the Barber,

1140
01:42:31,647 --> 01:42:34,480
we took our sons along,

1141
01:42:34,567 --> 01:42:37,957
the young Svanda, and my eldest
boy Jano.

1142
01:42:38,167 --> 01:42:41,364
Anosta joined us too,
as he was fired.

1143
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:43,165
Do you not perforate
the tickets?

1144
01:42:43,247 --> 01:42:44,646
For such a wage?

1145
01:42:44,727 --> 01:42:47,366
I do not give a damn
about the railway!

1146
01:42:47,567 --> 01:42:51,355
We should have known that!

1147
01:42:51,447 --> 01:42:55,042
You would not have gained anything.
Perhaps, you will go on foot.

1148
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:59,120
- Why?
- We are on strike.

1149
01:43:00,967 --> 01:43:03,959
We will not be paid the fares
back, I suppose.

1150
01:43:04,167 --> 01:43:06,158
I am going to complain.

1151
01:43:06,247 --> 01:43:08,636
In vain.

1152
01:43:09,567 --> 01:43:12,684
We were fired,
but they strike.

1153
01:43:13,567 --> 01:43:15,478
Our time will come.

1154
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:28,756
Let us ask those men.

1155
01:43:35,367 --> 01:43:37,358
Is there any job
for bricklayers?

1156
01:43:37,447 --> 01:43:38,243
Job?

1157
01:43:38,327 --> 01:43:41,160
Look, so many people,
all jobless!

1158
01:43:41,247 --> 01:43:43,807
They are as poor as we are.

1159
01:43:43,887 --> 01:43:48,563
The land belongs to those
who work and cultivate it!

1160
01:43:49,167 --> 01:43:52,125
If the farmers back
the proletariat,

1161
01:43:52,207 --> 01:43:54,960
landless peasants will not be
exploited any more.

1162
01:43:55,047 --> 01:43:58,562
The land will be parcelled out
and given to the poorest!

1163
01:44:00,367 --> 01:44:02,164
Let us join them!

1164
01:44:02,247 --> 01:44:05,364
I came here to make money,
not politics.

1165
01:44:05,447 --> 01:44:08,439
The Left-hander is right.

1166
01:44:08,527 --> 01:44:10,916
We do not belong here!

1167
01:44:11,007 --> 01:44:14,158
You are wrong,
this is our place.

1168
01:44:15,367 --> 01:44:17,562
Palo, stick to me!

1169
01:44:19,567 --> 01:44:20,716
Daddy!

1170
01:44:23,767 --> 01:44:26,156
It is going to be hot here...

1171
01:45:15,647 --> 01:45:17,842
Where is Janko?

1172
01:45:29,167 --> 01:45:31,556
Come! Fast!

1173
01:45:33,167 --> 01:45:35,362
Janko, get down!

1174
01:45:42,127 --> 01:45:44,925
Hide yourself!

1175
01:45:52,967 --> 01:45:55,765
Give me a hand.

1176
01:45:59,367 --> 01:46:02,165
What are you doing?

1177
01:46:02,247 --> 01:46:05,239
Have you all gone mad?

1178
01:47:11,407 --> 01:47:13,079
Dad is back!

1179
01:47:13,167 --> 01:47:16,955
- What is that?
- Try it. Potato sugar.

1180
01:47:17,047 --> 01:47:19,436
Mommy, look, sweets.

1181
01:47:19,967 --> 01:47:22,606
Where is Janko?

1182
01:47:42,087 --> 01:47:45,477
No! No!

1183
01:47:50,567 --> 01:47:53,365
Where did you leave our Janko?

1184
01:47:56,367 --> 01:47:58,562
He will not be lying here
anymore.

1185
01:47:58,647 --> 01:48:00,956
How can one disappear so easily?

1186
01:48:01,047 --> 01:48:05,757
Grandpa's dog vanished too.

1187
01:48:05,847 --> 01:48:09,442
I saw Eva crying.

1188
01:48:09,967 --> 01:48:13,357
- I will marry her.
- No, I will.

1189
01:48:22,767 --> 01:48:25,759
Stop it!

1190
01:48:26,767 --> 01:48:31,363
Where was your God
when Janko was shot?

1191
01:48:35,767 --> 01:48:38,759
It is a decisive meeting.

1192
01:48:39,367 --> 01:48:41,164
A common meeting
with nationalists.

1193
01:48:41,247 --> 01:48:43,761
We shall show them
what socialists can do.

1194
01:48:43,847 --> 01:48:44,836
Leave me alone.

1195
01:48:44,927 --> 01:48:48,920
It is a great day for us.
Hurry up.

1196
01:48:49,167 --> 01:48:51,158
We are going to be late.

1197
01:48:51,247 --> 01:48:53,044
I quit with politics.

1198
01:48:53,127 --> 01:48:56,756
We fight those who killed
your son.

1199
01:48:56,847 --> 01:49:01,363
If we win, nobody will ever
shoot at people!

1200
01:49:02,127 --> 01:49:04,516
Your Janko did not die in vain.

1201
01:49:04,607 --> 01:49:07,405
- He was my son.
- We all are sons.

1202
01:49:07,487 --> 01:49:11,196
- Karol has drawn Eva!
- That is not her!

1203
01:49:11,287 --> 01:49:12,959
Her hair looks like Eva's.

1204
01:49:13,047 --> 01:49:15,845
Come and have a look.

1205
01:49:16,367 --> 01:49:19,040
He has also drawn this.

1206
01:49:20,167 --> 01:49:22,158
Are you going with us?

1207
01:49:22,567 --> 01:49:26,162
Get out!

1208
01:49:28,567 --> 01:49:30,558
You too!

1209
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:35,762
As you wish.

1210
01:49:36,167 --> 01:49:39,159
Naughty boy!

1211
01:49:40,167 --> 01:49:42,158
Just like his grandfather.

1212
01:49:43,167 --> 01:49:47,558
God forgive him.

1213
01:49:54,567 --> 01:49:58,560
If you draw ugly things,

1214
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:01,959
you shall not get to heaven.

1215
01:50:02,047 --> 01:50:04,641
Is Eva ugly?

1216
01:50:05,167 --> 01:50:07,522
- Fetch me some water.
- Painter, shame on you.

1217
01:50:08,687 --> 01:50:10,564
Put my boots off, Samko.

1218
01:50:12,767 --> 01:50:16,760
Where are the grandpa's
pictures?

1219
01:50:19,167 --> 01:50:23,160
Grandma, are you all right?

1220
01:50:23,367 --> 01:50:26,359
She is in heaven.

1221
01:50:42,567 --> 01:50:44,956
They are together now.

1222
01:50:58,767 --> 01:51:01,565
I have financial problems.

1223
01:51:01,647 --> 01:51:05,435
My father-in-law's money
was not enough.

1224
01:51:06,967 --> 01:51:09,765
I invested too boldly.

1225
01:51:09,967 --> 01:51:12,356
I need my money from you.

1226
01:51:13,567 --> 01:51:16,559
Now when mother is dead...

1227
01:51:16,647 --> 01:51:19,559
if you want to keep the house,
you will have to pay me back.

1228
01:51:19,647 --> 01:51:21,638
You are mad.

1229
01:51:21,727 --> 01:51:23,524
When our father died, you said...

1230
01:51:23,607 --> 01:51:25,757
I could give away,
because I was not rich.

1231
01:51:25,847 --> 01:51:29,760
If I fail to put together
all my assets now,

1232
01:51:29,847 --> 01:51:32,236
I am lost. Try to understand me.

1233
01:51:32,967 --> 01:51:34,161
Shall I understand you?

1234
01:51:34,247 --> 01:51:37,239
We have nothing to eat!

1235
01:51:38,167 --> 01:51:40,761
Why did you get mix up
with the socialists?

1236
01:51:40,847 --> 01:51:41,962
You could still work
for the railway.

1237
01:51:42,047 --> 01:51:45,835
- You...!
- Daddy...

1238
01:51:47,967 --> 01:51:50,356
- Are you Karol?
- No, Peter.

1239
01:51:52,967 --> 01:51:55,037
Do you like the watch?

1240
01:51:55,567 --> 01:51:58,957
Keep it, a present
from Uncle Valent.

1241
01:52:00,367 --> 01:52:02,358
Thank you.

1242
01:52:02,447 --> 01:52:04,438
Look, Father.

1243
01:52:05,567 --> 01:52:09,003
No! My watch!

1244
01:52:12,047 --> 01:52:15,357
Stop crying, I will buy you
another one.

1245
01:52:15,447 --> 01:52:17,119
But I want this one!

1246
01:52:17,767 --> 01:52:20,042
I shall repair it.

1247
01:52:23,567 --> 01:52:27,560
- Do not worry.
- I am scared.

1248
01:52:28,167 --> 01:52:32,957
We have grown poor,
and the world is getting worse.

1249
01:52:42,167 --> 01:52:46,763
Father, what would you do now?

1250
01:52:46,967 --> 01:52:54,157
Would you make jokes, or dream
of exotic islands?

1251
01:52:54,247 --> 01:52:59,367
We have nothing left,
no house where to live...

1252
01:53:11,567 --> 01:53:14,320
Zanzibar is back!

1253
01:53:18,967 --> 01:53:22,357
- Grandpa's dog!
- That is not him.

1254
01:53:36,967 --> 01:53:38,958
Where are you?

1255
01:53:39,367 --> 01:53:41,358
No, Samo, no!

1256
01:53:41,447 --> 01:53:45,235
The dog has led me to the mill!

1257
01:53:46,567 --> 01:53:53,564
But the mill burnt down twice
and the millers committed suicides.

1258
01:53:53,767 --> 01:53:56,565
I am not scared.

1259
01:54:06,967 --> 01:54:10,357
We shall be fine here,
you will see.

1260
01:54:30,967 --> 01:54:35,199
Kristina, my little darling,
come here.

1261
01:54:45,567 --> 01:54:48,923
Matilda... welcome.

1262
01:54:52,367 --> 01:54:54,756
Come in.

1263
01:54:59,567 --> 01:55:02,559
We have a potato soup.

1264
01:55:05,007 --> 01:55:08,363
- Why is she crying?
- She is hungry.

1265
01:55:18,367 --> 01:55:21,359
You did not chop wood for me.

1266
01:55:23,567 --> 01:55:26,559
He will.

1267
01:55:33,567 --> 01:55:36,559
He is hungry too.

1268
01:55:45,767 --> 01:55:50,158
Only God us do part.

1269
01:55:50,967 --> 01:55:53,925
Or death.

1270
01:55:54,927 --> 01:55:56,838
Have you ever thought of that?

1271
01:56:06,567 --> 01:56:09,365
- Are you moving?
- To the mill.

1272
01:56:29,567 --> 01:56:33,162
Father, my watch works.

1273
01:56:34,167 --> 01:56:37,159
They have brought in our bees.

1274
01:56:37,247 --> 01:56:40,637
It is really ticking.

1275
01:56:42,167 --> 01:56:45,955
You are very handy.

1276
01:56:49,167 --> 01:56:52,955
- I have repaired it.
- Let me see.

1277
01:56:53,047 --> 01:56:56,039
It is the one from Uncle Valent.

1278
01:56:56,367 --> 01:56:58,164
You will become a master.

1279
01:56:58,247 --> 01:56:59,839
I know a watchmaker,

1280
01:56:59,927 --> 01:57:02,919
a good chap and a Social
Democrat.

1281
01:57:03,567 --> 01:57:05,398
Propaganda again?

1282
01:57:07,767 --> 01:57:10,440
This is where the bees
will be buzzing!

1283
01:57:24,367 --> 01:57:27,757
I want to go to America too!
Take us with you!

1284
01:57:32,967 --> 01:57:36,676
Do you not worry you could
burn down as your predecessor?

1285
01:57:37,367 --> 01:57:40,564
It has happened to me
several times.

1286
01:57:40,647 --> 01:57:43,639
I tell you something.

1287
01:57:43,727 --> 01:57:49,518
I worry about the future
of the Slovaks.

1288
01:57:49,967 --> 01:57:54,358
Some say they are Hungarians,
some Germans...

1289
01:57:54,767 --> 01:57:57,759
Those over there leave
for America.

1290
01:57:58,767 --> 01:58:02,362
What will be with us
ten years later?

1291
01:58:03,767 --> 01:58:06,156
We shall fit under a wagon canvas.

1292
01:58:06,247 --> 01:58:09,762
Do you think there will be
nobody to whom to mill?

1293
01:58:10,367 --> 01:58:12,961
There still will be
enough people.

1294
01:58:13,047 --> 01:58:14,958
You have children at least.

1295
01:58:15,047 --> 01:58:19,245
You are their teacher.
What are they like?

1296
01:58:19,567 --> 01:58:22,764
Peter is clever with his hands.

1297
01:58:22,847 --> 01:58:27,045
And Samko will take over your mill.

1298
01:58:27,567 --> 01:58:29,956
Peter will become a watchmaker.

1299
01:58:30,047 --> 01:58:34,438
And Karol will be
a great painter.

1300
01:58:37,767 --> 01:58:39,962
I almost forgot.

1301
01:58:40,167 --> 01:58:44,957
I have paints and canvas for him.
He must study at the Academy.

1302
01:58:45,047 --> 01:58:46,958
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

1303
01:58:47,047 --> 01:58:49,641
He has a great talent.

1304
01:58:50,767 --> 01:58:55,363
I had dreamt of becoming
a painter

1305
01:58:55,967 --> 01:58:58,561
...but what am I now?

1306
01:58:59,567 --> 01:59:02,957
A bad teacher.

1307
01:59:04,367 --> 01:59:09,361
I am far from having made
my dream come true.

1308
01:59:12,367 --> 01:59:14,164
Work!

1309
01:59:16,167 --> 01:59:18,556
It is starting!

1310
01:59:34,767 --> 01:59:36,758
It is running!

1311
01:59:37,967 --> 01:59:40,356
What a machine, isn't it?

1312
01:59:41,247 --> 01:59:43,522
Put a trough underneath!

1313
01:59:48,247 --> 01:59:51,637
- Wow, it is falling!
- Raise it!

1314
02:00:02,167 --> 02:00:04,556
Eat, good ghosts!

1315
02:00:05,167 --> 02:00:07,556
It is so soft!

1316
02:00:07,967 --> 02:00:11,164
And watch over us well.

1317
02:00:12,767 --> 02:00:14,758
She was so scared, and now...

1318
02:00:14,847 --> 02:00:16,678
I am going to bake bread
right now.

1319
02:00:16,767 --> 02:00:20,362
This is for cakes.

1320
02:00:23,167 --> 02:00:25,761
Children, it is a God's gift.

1321
02:00:25,967 --> 02:00:29,562
You have become a businessman.

1322
02:00:29,647 --> 02:00:35,756
Prepare some chests
for all the money.

1323
02:00:35,847 --> 02:00:38,441
Oh, forget it.

1324
02:00:38,767 --> 02:00:41,361
I, a businessman?

1325
02:00:41,447 --> 02:00:44,041
What is a businessman?

1326
02:00:44,167 --> 02:00:47,159
Uncle Valent is one.

1327
02:00:47,247 --> 02:00:50,239
Shall we be rich too?

1328
02:00:50,367 --> 02:00:52,756
Would you like to be rich?

1329
02:00:52,847 --> 02:00:55,839
You all will be trained
in useful trades.

1330
02:00:56,767 --> 02:01:01,363
Back to school again?
I would rather be rich.

1331
02:01:03,967 --> 02:01:05,958
To better times in the new mill!

1332
02:01:06,047 --> 02:01:08,163
Cheers!

1333
02:01:08,247 --> 02:01:11,239
Kristina, cheers!

1334
02:01:12,767 --> 02:01:14,962
Cheers!

1335
02:01:20,767 --> 02:01:24,316
Hurry up, Marta, serve the drinks!

1336
02:01:35,967 --> 02:01:38,162
Why are you closing your eyes?

1337
02:01:39,967 --> 02:01:41,161
Why are you pricking me?

1338
02:01:41,247 --> 02:01:44,842
- I? I am shaven.
- You do it with your nose.

1339
02:01:47,967 --> 02:01:51,357
Father wrote me to join him
in America.

1340
02:01:52,767 --> 02:01:55,759
Would you like to go with me?

1341
02:01:56,967 --> 02:01:59,561
What will you give me?

1342
02:02:05,767 --> 02:02:09,157
Let us go right now
by a steamer across the ocean.

1343
02:02:10,367 --> 02:02:12,358
- Are you afraid of it?
- No!

1344
02:02:12,447 --> 02:02:14,642
Catch me then!

1345
02:02:15,367 --> 02:02:16,959
But I am supposed to take over the mill.

1346
02:02:17,047 --> 02:02:19,641
Then I shall go
with another boy.

1347
02:02:22,967 --> 02:02:24,605
I would follow you to the ends
of the earth.

1348
02:02:24,687 --> 02:02:27,884
Let us get married.
Do you want me?

1349
02:02:28,967 --> 02:02:31,162
Yes, I do.

1350
02:02:31,367 --> 02:02:33,756
Turn around.

1351
02:02:37,767 --> 02:02:39,758
Do not look!

1352
02:02:41,767 --> 02:02:44,565
I am not looking.

1353
02:02:55,967 --> 02:02:58,959
I will be yours

1354
02:03:02,167 --> 02:03:04,761
till the day I die.

1355
02:03:07,767 --> 02:03:10,361
Kiss me.

1356
02:03:14,767 --> 02:03:16,758
I am dizzy.

1357
02:03:16,847 --> 02:03:19,839
The whole world is spinning around.

1358
02:03:25,767 --> 02:03:30,363
Instead of coming back,
your father takes you from me.

1359
02:03:35,447 --> 02:03:39,042
- Why do you not go?
- Who would stay here?

1360
02:03:39,127 --> 02:03:41,118
Will we ever see you again,
Samko?

1361
02:03:41,207 --> 02:03:44,005
Eva, give my regards
to you father in America.

1362
02:03:44,087 --> 02:03:48,877
Let him not forget
that we are relatives.

1363
02:03:48,967 --> 02:03:54,360
Remind him of his promise
to send me a ticket.

1364
02:03:54,447 --> 02:03:58,440
Then I shall take a ship
for America.

1365
02:03:58,567 --> 02:04:01,559
To become a banker.

1366
02:04:01,967 --> 02:04:05,562
If Grandfather were alive,
he would join us.

1367
02:04:07,967 --> 02:04:09,958
The life seems somehow
sadder now.

1368
02:04:10,047 --> 02:04:13,039
My father used to build
even in his sixty.

1369
02:04:13,167 --> 02:04:15,158
The world was different then.

1370
02:04:15,247 --> 02:04:18,239
We only can be saved fighting
against capital.

1371
02:04:18,327 --> 02:04:22,320
- The proletarians must...
- You and your politics!

1372
02:04:24,367 --> 02:04:28,155
And you had better go to balls
instead of meetings.

1373
02:04:28,247 --> 02:04:31,842
Obey your father, watchmaker.

1374
02:04:37,167 --> 02:04:40,557
Look, what a machine!

1375
02:04:42,167 --> 02:04:45,159
I have already seen such.

1376
02:04:46,167 --> 02:04:48,840
- It is called automobile.
- What does he want here?

1377
02:04:50,567 --> 02:04:52,956
That is your uncle.

1378
02:04:54,367 --> 02:04:57,962
When I win the lottery,
I will buy one too.

1379
02:05:00,167 --> 02:05:01,566
Sister-in-law...

1380
02:05:01,647 --> 02:05:03,638
Why did you not let us know?

1381
02:05:03,727 --> 02:05:05,319
What a nice mill you have!

1382
02:05:05,407 --> 02:05:07,796
Having made you sell the house
I helped you.

1383
02:05:07,887 --> 02:05:11,880
- Kristina... yours?
- As you see.

1384
02:05:12,087 --> 02:05:14,885
You know Hermina.

1385
02:05:17,367 --> 02:05:19,756
But you have not seen
this one yet.

1386
02:05:19,847 --> 02:05:21,883
This is my daughter, Hilda.

1387
02:05:22,967 --> 02:05:25,765
Why don't you come and see us?

1388
02:05:25,847 --> 02:05:28,236
I am too busy.

1389
02:05:30,167 --> 02:05:31,964
Your son is getting married,

1390
02:05:32,047 --> 02:05:36,359
- but I have no present.
- No need.

1391
02:05:36,967 --> 02:05:40,562
Is that Karol's work?

1392
02:05:41,767 --> 02:05:46,363
- How is he doing at the Academy?
- We seldom hear from him.

1393
02:05:47,967 --> 02:05:51,562
You have moved our father's
bee-house.

1394
02:05:55,567 --> 02:05:58,764
Our old bee-house.

1395
02:06:00,767 --> 02:06:04,362
Maps, engravings...

1396
02:06:07,567 --> 02:06:09,478
How small everything seems.

1397
02:06:10,967 --> 02:06:12,958
You are big now.

1398
02:06:17,167 --> 02:06:21,160
I needed the money badly,
but then I invested well.

1399
02:06:23,567 --> 02:06:25,239
Now I can help you.

1400
02:06:26,167 --> 02:06:28,362
I have a special order
from the army,

1401
02:06:28,447 --> 02:06:32,042
my business has been
flourishing.

1402
02:06:33,967 --> 02:06:36,242
My mill too!

1403
02:06:36,567 --> 02:06:39,559
It is nice here.

1404
02:06:39,647 --> 02:06:41,638
Watch out for the bees!

1405
02:06:41,767 --> 02:06:46,966
Like back then when Father
turned sixty.

1406
02:06:47,567 --> 02:06:52,766
Come here to take pictures!
Let us go.

1407
02:06:55,727 --> 02:06:57,604
Do not touch it,
you will dirty it!

1408
02:07:00,367 --> 02:07:03,757
We all will be in the picture.

1409
02:07:04,167 --> 02:07:06,203
Steady!

1410
02:07:07,567 --> 02:07:09,558
Say cheese!

1411
02:07:12,967 --> 02:07:15,356
Let us hide!

1412
02:07:17,967 --> 02:07:20,959
My hat! Catch it!

1413
02:07:40,367 --> 02:07:41,846
Hold the horse!

1414
02:07:45,167 --> 02:07:48,398
Pray, everybody.
The Day of Judgement!

1415
02:07:55,167 --> 02:07:57,965
Miller, are you in?

1416
02:08:00,767 --> 02:08:02,166
What is going on?

1417
02:08:02,247 --> 02:08:04,636
Shut the door!

1418
02:08:05,567 --> 02:08:08,559
It has finally happened.

1419
02:08:08,647 --> 02:08:11,115
Did dogs tear you, Gagos?

1420
02:08:11,207 --> 02:08:16,201
The successor to the throne
has been assassinated in Sarajevo.

1421
02:08:16,287 --> 02:08:19,882
Where did you hear that?

1422
02:08:20,367 --> 02:08:23,962
Believe the old Gagos.

1423
02:08:24,367 --> 02:08:29,236
There is to be a war.

1424
02:08:32,367 --> 02:08:35,359
Do not believe that!
They will only shoot a little.

1425
02:08:35,447 --> 02:08:39,440
They will teach the Serbian
rabble a lesson!

1426
02:08:41,967 --> 02:08:46,404
I hope you will not be laughing
on the other side of your face.

1427
02:08:49,567 --> 02:08:52,957
The war is good business
for them.

1428
02:08:53,047 --> 02:08:56,437
I think that they will involve
the whole world in it.

1429
02:08:57,367 --> 02:09:00,245
The Socialist International
will not allow that.

1430
02:09:01,167 --> 02:09:04,557
You cannot imagine
what our party can do.

1431
02:09:04,647 --> 02:09:08,037
Your party will not give
a damn about us.

1432
02:09:08,127 --> 02:09:11,517
Poor people will be killed,
as always.

1433
02:09:11,607 --> 02:09:15,202
Our boys, then we.

1434
02:09:15,287 --> 02:09:18,962
We, the bricklayers,
can benefit from the war.

1435
02:09:19,287 --> 02:09:24,281
We will be busy with ruined
houses twenty years.

1436
02:09:27,167 --> 02:09:30,557
What if a bullet finds you?

1437
02:09:33,367 --> 02:09:34,959
The death even avoids me.

1438
02:09:57,167 --> 02:09:58,680
Teach the Serbian mob a lesson!

1439
02:09:59,767 --> 02:10:01,758
Long live the war!

1440
02:10:04,767 --> 02:10:06,758
At them, boys!

1441
02:10:07,167 --> 02:10:09,965
Why do you not join the army?

1442
02:10:10,367 --> 02:10:12,562
If I were your age, I would
do so right away.

1443
02:10:12,647 --> 02:10:15,366
It is an honour to fight
for our fatherland.

1444
02:10:15,567 --> 02:10:19,162
I cannot. I am a Russian spy.

1445
02:10:19,767 --> 02:10:22,565
What did you say? Follow me!

1446
02:10:25,767 --> 02:10:26,961
Let him be!

1447
02:10:27,047 --> 02:10:28,036
They are my apprentices.

1448
02:10:28,127 --> 02:10:29,355
What do you want from him?

1449
02:10:29,447 --> 02:10:30,562
Release me!

1450
02:10:30,647 --> 02:10:31,523
Let him be!

1451
02:10:31,607 --> 02:10:34,599
The other one too!

1452
02:10:42,967 --> 02:10:44,958
Soldiers!

1453
02:10:58,367 --> 02:10:59,766
Open the mill!

1454
02:10:59,847 --> 02:11:04,159
From now on you will grind
for the army!

1455
02:11:04,367 --> 02:11:05,959
Open the mill, we bring corn.

1456
02:11:06,047 --> 02:11:08,356
You will grind for
the Austrian-Hungarian Army.

1457
02:11:08,447 --> 02:11:12,042
I have more work
than I can manage.

1458
02:11:13,967 --> 02:11:17,960
I leave several men here,
you have three days to do it.

1459
02:11:18,047 --> 02:11:19,560
What shall I get for that?

1460
02:11:19,647 --> 02:11:22,286
It is your patriotic duty.

1461
02:11:22,367 --> 02:11:28,158
We confirm that you work for us,
and you will stay at home.

1462
02:11:28,247 --> 02:11:30,442
Give orders to your soldiers,
not to me!

1463
02:11:30,527 --> 02:11:32,119
I shall not do that!

1464
02:11:32,207 --> 02:11:33,196
Csolle!

1465
02:11:33,287 --> 02:11:36,006
What do you want? Blame it!

1466
02:11:36,087 --> 02:11:38,078
Let him be!

1467
02:11:38,167 --> 02:11:41,159
Samo, they will kill you!

1468
02:11:41,367 --> 02:11:44,757
They will harm you,
do not go against them!

1469
02:11:48,767 --> 02:11:52,760
We can seize your mill.

1470
02:11:52,847 --> 02:11:55,202
At your service!

1471
02:11:55,967 --> 02:11:58,959
Ten men to assist the miller!

1472
02:11:59,047 --> 02:12:03,040
Lieutenant is a tough man,
be amicable.

1473
02:12:28,167 --> 02:12:31,955
Hold on, boys!

1474
02:12:32,167 --> 02:12:34,965
Use your heads.

1475
02:13:11,567 --> 02:13:12,966
Even a horse would die here.

1476
02:13:13,047 --> 02:13:15,436
Here, have one.

1477
02:13:22,367 --> 02:13:25,359
Vavro, I am deserting.

1478
02:13:25,447 --> 02:13:27,438
It is now or never!

1479
02:13:27,567 --> 02:13:29,364
No!

1480
02:13:29,447 --> 02:13:31,244
Captivity is worse than death.

1481
02:13:31,327 --> 02:13:33,124
- I hope you will not regret!
- The Russians will kill you.

1482
02:13:33,207 --> 02:13:36,995
Better than to be dying here.
I am going too.

1483
02:13:37,567 --> 02:13:39,364
You will be shot dead!

1484
02:13:39,447 --> 02:13:43,838
The whole Vienna can kiss my ass.
Have a nice time here, Vavro.

1485
02:13:44,367 --> 02:13:47,165
Goodbye, Austria.

1486
02:13:53,847 --> 02:13:57,760
Deserters! Shoot!
Stop them!

1487
02:14:07,367 --> 02:14:10,359
We are Slovaks! The Slavs!

1488
02:14:13,767 --> 02:14:16,565
We are alive!

1489
02:14:31,767 --> 02:14:35,760
This is the second night
I dreamt of my dead father.

1490
02:14:36,967 --> 02:14:39,959
He was sitting at table
with our children

1491
02:14:40,367 --> 02:14:43,564
and I was shooting at them.

1492
02:14:44,367 --> 02:14:47,598
It was breaking my heart,
but I was doing it anyway.

1493
02:14:50,967 --> 02:14:53,561
Pray.

1494
02:14:54,367 --> 02:14:56,961
The dead call the alive,

1495
02:14:57,767 --> 02:15:00,804
but we are helpless.

1496
02:15:01,967 --> 02:15:05,357
If I had not the mill,
I would now be killing people.

1497
02:15:05,967 --> 02:15:07,605
Who knows why.

1498
02:15:17,967 --> 02:15:20,561
What a wonderful horse!

1499
02:15:21,167 --> 02:15:24,762
Would you make an equestrian
statue for me?

1500
02:15:25,367 --> 02:15:29,155
- Who will pay?
- The army.

1501
02:15:29,367 --> 02:15:31,961
Here you see our students
working on a classical composition.

1502
02:15:32,047 --> 02:15:35,039
Nice.

1503
02:15:38,167 --> 02:15:40,362
An armchair!

1504
02:15:43,967 --> 02:15:46,925
Painting is a nice job.

1505
02:15:47,007 --> 02:15:51,000
Une chose interessante!

1506
02:15:53,367 --> 02:15:55,801
You are doing a fine job, boys!

1507
02:15:55,887 --> 02:16:02,281
But now, your motherland
does not need

1508
02:16:02,847 --> 02:16:07,682
your gift and hands,

1509
02:16:07,767 --> 02:16:10,839
it needs your brave hearts.

1510
02:16:12,167 --> 02:16:15,955
Inter arma silent musae!

1511
02:16:18,967 --> 02:16:21,845
Remember that well.

1512
02:16:27,967 --> 02:16:30,959
Translate that, student.

1513
02:16:31,047 --> 02:16:34,244
In a time of war...

1514
02:16:34,327 --> 02:16:36,363
the Muses fall silent.

1515
02:16:36,447 --> 02:16:40,759
A Slovak! I like the Slovaks.

1516
02:16:42,567 --> 02:16:44,762
Fight bravely!

1517
02:16:44,847 --> 02:16:49,045
We shall meet
in the battlefield, boys!

1518
02:16:51,367 --> 02:16:52,846
Go on drawing!

1519
02:16:58,967 --> 02:17:00,958
Goodbye!

1520
02:17:03,767 --> 02:17:05,962
Take care of yourself!

1521
02:17:06,967 --> 02:17:09,959
Remember us!

1522
02:17:11,967 --> 02:17:16,961
The worst thing is gas.
It killed my son in the trench.

1523
02:17:35,767 --> 02:17:36,961
Drive!

1524
02:17:37,047 --> 02:17:40,437
The belt pulley!

1525
02:17:41,767 --> 02:17:44,361
Dear Father and Mother,

1526
02:17:44,447 --> 02:17:45,436
I wanted to become an artist,

1527
02:17:45,527 --> 02:17:49,918
but it is not sure
since I must wear a uniform.

1528
02:17:50,007 --> 02:17:56,401
The Left-hander's son is here.
He takes it easy.

1529
02:18:03,967 --> 02:18:07,960
The world has thousands faces,
I draw them whenever I can.

1530
02:18:09,167 --> 02:18:12,762
I would prefer not to sleep at all.

1531
02:18:14,767 --> 02:18:17,964
At night, memories haunt me.

1532
02:18:18,767 --> 02:18:23,966
Your faces, our village
as I saw it when I was small.

1533
02:18:51,367 --> 02:18:54,962
Look into the shed
and under the floor!

1534
02:18:55,047 --> 02:18:57,038
That is all.

1535
02:18:57,127 --> 02:19:01,120
- What do you keep in the shed?
- Your grandmother!

1536
02:19:03,167 --> 02:19:05,158
Look there!

1537
02:19:21,767 --> 02:19:26,716
Even the bees have more sense
than we, they sting at least.

1538
02:19:35,767 --> 02:19:38,156
Dear Samko,

1539
02:19:38,767 --> 02:19:44,956
I tried to find in the map
where the wind had carried you.

1540
02:19:45,167 --> 02:19:51,356
You probably have not heard in America
about the war, that kills people here.

1541
02:19:52,967 --> 02:19:55,765
When you were born,

1542
02:19:55,847 --> 02:19:59,840
we used to cut grass up
in the hills

1543
02:20:00,367 --> 02:20:03,359
and carried you in a sheet,

1544
02:20:03,447 --> 02:20:07,440
since you could not walk yet.

1545
02:20:38,967 --> 02:20:41,959
Oh my God, the postman!
Go away!

1546
02:20:47,567 --> 02:20:51,560
- Our Julo is still alive.
- Thanks heaven.

1547
02:20:55,767 --> 02:20:58,156
That is all right.

1548
02:21:04,367 --> 02:21:06,961
Oh my God!

1549
02:21:07,767 --> 02:21:10,565
They got him!

1550
02:21:26,767 --> 02:21:29,565
You killed her!

1551
02:21:29,647 --> 02:21:32,036
Take it easy.

1552
02:21:33,967 --> 02:21:37,357
We must survive.

1553
02:21:40,367 --> 02:21:43,564
We just have to break the war's neck
the way the Russians did.

1554
02:21:43,647 --> 02:21:48,357
But we are stupid
and let the emperor die in bed.

1555
02:21:49,967 --> 02:21:53,562
If I had dynamite,
I would blow up all military transports.

1556
02:21:53,647 --> 02:21:57,640
- Other trains would come.
- But not through this tunnel!

1557
02:22:01,567 --> 02:22:07,563
Why do you not shoot generals
instead of the poor?

1558
02:22:07,647 --> 02:22:09,239
- Halt!
- What do you want?

1559
02:22:09,327 --> 02:22:11,761
No trespassing!

1560
02:22:11,847 --> 02:22:17,797
- We cannot even walk here.
- He would surely fire.

1561
02:22:17,967 --> 02:22:19,923
What a rat!

1562
02:22:50,207 --> 02:22:52,801
Welcome, Your Excellency.

1563
02:22:54,567 --> 02:22:57,764
I am glad to see you, sir.

1564
02:23:01,767 --> 02:23:07,956
Your leather is the basis
for our war success.

1565
02:23:11,167 --> 02:23:14,557
I am glad you are pleased.

1566
02:23:15,967 --> 02:23:18,561
Where is he?

1567
02:23:24,567 --> 02:23:26,364
Faster!

1568
02:23:28,767 --> 02:23:29,563
Hold this!

1569
02:23:29,647 --> 02:23:33,162
- What is that?
- A few grenades.

1570
02:23:33,567 --> 02:23:37,162
Easy, or it will blow up.

1571
02:23:37,367 --> 02:23:40,359
You are an anarchist.
What do you need them for?

1572
02:23:40,447 --> 02:23:43,041
We shall see.

1573
02:23:43,167 --> 02:23:46,557
Enough to blow up
the railway station.

1574
02:23:47,367 --> 02:23:49,483
I know what to do
with them.

1575
02:23:51,167 --> 02:23:53,965
Whoever is hungry he is invited
to join us.

1576
02:23:54,047 --> 02:23:55,765
There is going to be
a dinner party.

1577
02:23:55,847 --> 02:23:57,599
You all will eat.

1578
02:23:57,687 --> 02:23:59,484
I am going to treat you.

1579
02:23:59,567 --> 02:24:04,960
Samo is raving like his father.

1580
02:24:05,167 --> 02:24:07,158
Join us, Father.

1581
02:24:07,247 --> 02:24:10,364
We are going to feed the hungry
just like Jesus Christ.

1582
02:24:11,167 --> 02:24:14,557
That is blasphemy!

1583
02:24:14,967 --> 02:24:19,358
I am going too!

1584
02:24:24,567 --> 02:24:26,717
Father, surrender!

1585
02:24:27,367 --> 02:24:31,360
- Which one has arrived?
- Karol.

1586
02:24:35,567 --> 02:24:38,957
Welcome home, son.
Unharmed?

1587
02:24:39,047 --> 02:24:42,039
Thanks God, he is all right!

1588
02:24:42,967 --> 02:24:45,356
The Italians attacked us with gas.

1589
02:24:45,447 --> 02:24:49,440
We nearly went blind,
so I am on leave now.

1590
02:25:03,567 --> 02:25:06,365
- What have you got there?
- Grenades.

1591
02:25:06,447 --> 02:25:10,440
Come, you know how to handle them.

1592
02:25:10,767 --> 02:25:13,565
Mother, there is going to be
an explosion!

1593
02:25:34,767 --> 02:25:38,362
Matilda, come along!

1594
02:25:42,367 --> 02:25:44,756
Fish!

1595
02:25:48,167 --> 02:25:51,557
Look at all the fish!

1596
02:26:01,967 --> 02:26:04,162
Watch the bones!

1597
02:26:04,247 --> 02:26:06,238
This table has been set for you.

1598
02:26:06,367 --> 02:26:10,963
Eat and enjoy yourselves!

1599
02:26:13,567 --> 02:26:17,560
Come everybody, join us.

1600
02:26:18,367 --> 02:26:22,155
Nobody will cry or starve anymore.

1601
02:26:22,247 --> 02:26:28,038
We shall all meet in the land
where the sun never sets.

1602
02:26:28,367 --> 02:26:30,756
Welcome!

1603
02:26:38,767 --> 02:26:40,962
Slovaks!

1604
02:26:41,047 --> 02:26:44,244
This table is set for you.

1605
02:26:44,367 --> 02:26:49,566
You have been hungry too long.

1606
02:26:50,567 --> 02:26:52,159
Wine and dine,

1607
02:26:52,247 --> 02:26:57,640
and be happy for a thousand
oncoming years...

1608
02:27:18,167 --> 02:27:21,159
- Where do you come from?
- Madagascar.

1609
02:27:21,367 --> 02:27:24,564
So you are at home at last.

1610
02:27:26,767 --> 02:27:29,327
What about a game of mariage?

1611
02:27:40,167 --> 02:27:44,365
Look at our country.

1612
02:27:44,447 --> 02:27:47,644
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Like a paradise, Dad.

1613
02:27:47,767 --> 02:27:52,363
The party is not over yet.

1614
02:27:52,967 --> 02:27:56,562
Our leave is over, we must go.

1615
02:27:57,967 --> 02:28:00,162
Take care of yourself.

1616
02:28:00,367 --> 02:28:03,359
The time has passed
like a dream.

1617
02:28:03,767 --> 02:28:06,156
When shall we see you again?

1618
02:28:06,247 --> 02:28:09,637
A few shots more, then we are
back at home.

1619
02:28:22,567 --> 02:28:26,958
Biro died, the railwayman.

1620
02:28:28,167 --> 02:28:29,919
You too...

1621
02:28:40,367 --> 02:28:42,358
Are you in?

1622
02:28:42,567 --> 02:28:45,161
A wire.

1623
02:28:45,367 --> 02:28:47,756
Sign here.

1624
02:29:00,167 --> 02:29:02,556
Read.

1625
02:29:07,967 --> 02:29:10,435
You put too much salt
into the soup.

1626
02:29:33,567 --> 02:29:36,957
Now we are both alone.

1627
02:30:09,967 --> 02:30:12,561
Let us stick together!

1628
02:30:19,367 --> 02:30:23,918
- Are you alive, Palo?
- My leg hurts like hell.

1629
02:30:24,767 --> 02:30:28,157
The main thing is we survived.

1630
02:30:37,367 --> 02:30:41,360
Doctor, I cannot feel anything.

1631
02:30:41,567 --> 02:30:43,956
Change the bandage, nurse.

1632
02:30:50,567 --> 02:30:53,559
Advanced gangrene.

1633
02:30:54,767 --> 02:30:59,761
- Will you cut my leg off?
- Have a rest now.

1634
02:30:59,847 --> 02:31:02,600
Have a sleep.

1635
02:31:05,567 --> 02:31:08,559
I prefer death

1636
02:31:08,647 --> 02:31:11,844
to the life with one leg!

1637
02:31:12,167 --> 02:31:15,557
No!

1638
02:31:16,567 --> 02:31:18,956
I do not want!

1639
02:31:20,767 --> 02:31:22,166
Go to hell!

1640
02:31:22,367 --> 02:31:24,756
I shall not have it cut!

1641
02:31:26,367 --> 02:31:27,880
Leave me alone!

1642
02:31:27,967 --> 02:31:28,763
No, no...

1643
02:31:28,847 --> 02:31:29,962
My leg...

1644
02:31:30,047 --> 02:31:32,436
Scream, you will feel at ease.

1645
02:31:32,567 --> 02:31:33,556
I do not want it to be done!

1646
02:31:33,647 --> 02:31:34,716
Lift him!

1647
02:31:34,847 --> 02:31:38,840
Karol, I do not want!

1648
02:32:03,367 --> 02:32:06,165
They have cut off my leg.

1649
02:32:06,247 --> 02:32:09,956
Do you hear?

1650
02:32:18,767 --> 02:32:21,565
Karol!

1651
02:32:25,967 --> 02:32:30,961
We have honey, fine and sweet,
For Saturday and all the week.

1652
02:32:31,167 --> 02:32:34,762
- Are you not glad?
- I am.

1653
02:32:34,847 --> 02:32:36,565
Not now, Marek.

1654
02:32:37,567 --> 02:32:40,161
I do not remember we have ever
had so much honey.

1655
02:32:40,367 --> 02:32:42,164
There used to be even more!

1656
02:32:43,367 --> 02:32:45,961
Do not write all the time, Dad!

1657
02:32:46,567 --> 02:32:50,162
- Now look what you have done.
- You threw it in there.

1658
02:32:50,767 --> 02:32:52,564
Wait!

1659
02:32:53,567 --> 02:32:55,956
You will be sticky.

1660
02:32:56,967 --> 02:32:58,764
Let it be!

1661
02:33:10,367 --> 02:33:12,961
Honey is all over your body.

1662
02:33:13,047 --> 02:33:16,835
I could eat you, you are so sweet.

1663
02:33:18,167 --> 02:33:18,963
What is in it?

1664
02:33:23,567 --> 02:33:25,956
Do not tell my wife.

1665
02:33:26,967 --> 02:33:28,559
He must have died in hospital...

1666
02:33:28,647 --> 02:33:31,844
I have my grandfather's chronicle!

1667
02:33:31,967 --> 02:33:34,959
...since they are sending his things.

1668
02:33:36,367 --> 02:33:38,437
Some leave even less stuff.

1669
02:33:38,527 --> 02:33:40,961
I have been bringing bad news
almost to every house.

1670
02:33:41,567 --> 02:33:45,321
They brought us delicious
watermelons.

1671
02:33:45,687 --> 02:33:48,440
Suddenly a strange thing
happened.

1672
02:33:49,167 --> 02:33:54,605
The farmer's wife popped her eyes out
and stuck out her tongue.

1673
02:33:54,767 --> 02:33:57,964
Can you hear, Father?
It is funny.

1674
02:34:00,167 --> 02:34:03,364
The men were staring,

1675
02:34:03,447 --> 02:34:07,963
thinking she had gone mad.

1676
02:34:08,047 --> 02:34:13,838
But I took a knife
and made a hole in her throat.

1677
02:34:14,367 --> 02:34:16,756
Only then could she take a breath.

1678
02:34:16,847 --> 02:34:19,839
She would have died,

1679
02:34:19,927 --> 02:34:23,522
as a bee had stung her
in her tongue.

1680
02:34:23,607 --> 02:34:27,077
Such a small creature,
but it can kill a human.

1681
02:34:27,967 --> 02:34:30,276
Think then what man can do.

1682
02:34:32,367 --> 02:34:34,961
Anything.

1683
02:34:35,967 --> 02:34:38,356
If he wants to.

1684
02:34:39,767 --> 02:34:40,882
Father...

1685
02:34:42,967 --> 02:34:46,755
Where are your boys, Samo?

1686
02:34:47,567 --> 02:34:50,161
None has left.

1687
02:34:50,247 --> 02:34:56,243
These are bad times
when fathers outlive their children.

1688
02:35:04,367 --> 02:35:08,758
Take the hive, do not worry.

1689
02:35:16,967 --> 02:35:20,960
The bee is born to build

1690
02:35:21,007 --> 02:35:27,162
and when its life is threatened
it defends itself using its sting.

1691
02:35:30,967 --> 02:35:35,483
- Even at the cost of its own life?
- Even then, my son.

1692
02:35:46,967 --> 02:35:51,358
Do not go away, my son.

1693
02:35:51,447 --> 02:35:53,563
The war is not over yet.

1694
02:35:53,647 --> 02:35:55,922
A bricklayer works
in bad times too.

1695
02:35:58,167 --> 02:36:00,522
We are going with you, Father.

1696
02:36:03,567 --> 02:36:06,365
We all shall go.

1697
02:36:07,967 --> 02:36:10,959
All of us.

1698
02:36:31,367 --> 02:36:37,363
Get up, we are going to work!

1699
02:36:42,247 --> 02:36:45,239
Bricklayers, we have a job!

1700
02:36:52,367 --> 02:36:55,359
Samo Pichanda is our leader!

1701
02:36:55,447 --> 02:36:57,642
I have brought you your coat.

1702
02:37:16,967 --> 02:37:21,404
We are going to block
the tunnels!

1703
02:37:22,167 --> 02:37:24,556
We shall wall them up.

1704
02:37:37,367 --> 02:37:39,961
To our victory!

1705
02:37:41,167 --> 02:37:42,600
Vivat Austria!

1706
02:37:48,167 --> 02:37:51,716
Emperor, look!
Focus your field glass.

1707
02:38:23,367 --> 02:38:24,959
What is he doing there?

1708
02:38:25,047 --> 02:38:27,766
Halt! Come back!

1709
02:38:29,767 --> 02:38:33,203
Come here!
Halt, or I shall shoot!

1710
02:38:47,247 --> 02:38:49,636
Whistle.

1711
02:38:53,367 --> 02:38:54,925
Just whistle.

1712
02:38:55,167 --> 02:38:57,237
I am waiting for you.

1713
02:38:57,327 --> 02:39:00,205
Come on, gentlemen,
the table is set for you.
