1
00:00:08,178 --> 00:00:11,448
FORTY-FOUR MUTINEERS

2
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:16,968
Chin up, chaps!

3
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:29,288
Yes. Chin up, chaps!

4
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:33,208
They are afraid of our courage.

5
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:37,368
We are not alone. They are.

6
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:41,608
They have already died, we are starting to live.

7
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:46,168
Thank you. Old man. The march will be easier now.

8
00:04:47,338 --> 00:04:51,298
Oh, dear boys...

9
00:04:55,938 --> 00:05:00,528
So many mothers, so many women!

10
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:03,458
My dear Julka. Forgive me.

11
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:06,448
I promised you to come back.

12
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:10,418
Don't be angry with me and don't be sad.

13
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:16,938
A short time together. But what a nice beginning!

14
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:22,418
It is said love at first sight is only found in novels,

15
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:24,288
but I do not believe that.

16
00:05:24,378 --> 00:05:27,928
What did our meeting have in common with a novel?

17
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:33,888
As soon as I saw you I was lost.

18
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:45,808
I had no place where to hide and could not run away.

19
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:48,408
I was like paralyzed.

20
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,848
My legs, arms and head.

21
00:05:51,338 --> 00:05:55,008
And I felt a terrible beat in my chest.

22
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:59,088
Nothing like that had ever happened to me.

23
00:05:59,178 --> 00:06:01,328
A peculiar feeling.

24
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:07,248
Though I was confused I felt well.

25
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,658
Julka was inscrutable.

26
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,938
I never knew what she was going to do.

27
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:19,248
Kiss me, Viktor.

28
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:22,408
I have never been kissed.

29
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:25,298
That is not a trifle.

30
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:28,688
I was afraid of fainting.

31
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,848
She probably did not like it.

32
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:35,138
However. It was a nice day so both of us were silent.

33
00:06:35,298 --> 00:06:37,568
Far and wide was nobody and nothing

34
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:42,018
but flowers around and the sky above.

35
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:46,458
Then a small cloud came and I realized

36
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:51,328
it's time to introduce myself to her father.

37
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:56,618
As all women. Julka pretended she was angry

38
00:06:56,698 --> 00:07:02,458
but I knew nothing in our lives would us do part.

39
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:14,128
All right, but I worry you are hard of hearing.

40
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:16,018
Hard of hearing?

41
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:19,248
I said Marka was expecting too.

42
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,088
I heard that.

43
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:25,658
Who else?

44
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:30,288
Me.

45
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:36,098
Shout or tear your hair but do something!

46
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:42,128
A baby... a girl.

47
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:46,288
Say it will be a girl.

48
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:49,288
Of course if you want it.

49
00:07:49,378 --> 00:07:52,968
What a feeling!

50
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:56,928
You don't know what it means to be a father.

51
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,608
I really don't. Tell me.

52
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:04,768
We must get married soon.

53
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:08,658
If you wish...

54
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:13,938
- How to say it to your father? - He already knows.

55
00:08:36,618 --> 00:08:40,448
Mr. Kolibec. War!

56
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:45,938
We are at war!

57
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:19,648
On the following day I had to leave.

58
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,328
You were standing by the carriage.

59
00:09:22,418 --> 00:09:25,458
I can see and hear you as if it were now.

60
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:30,688
You said: It doesn't matter we couldn't get married.

61
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:33,248
I know you will come back.

62
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:37,168
Our girl will have a good father.

63
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:41,568
I was with you before every attack.

64
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:45,088
Promising you I'd return home.

65
00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:50,808
I have killed nobody and can embrace you with clean hands.

66
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:55,728
None of us wants to kill. Nor my friend. Tono,

67
00:09:55,818 --> 00:09:58,728
nor father Gulej and his son.

68
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:01,888
We are scared of fire but we must go.

69
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:04,368
We must...

70
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:24,258
Father, what's going to happen?

71
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:29,938
Stop crying! Don't be a disgrace to our regiment!

72
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:31,738
Just cry. My boy.

73
00:10:31,818 --> 00:10:34,378
I was scared to death before the first attack.

74
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,338
It is growing calm, we are to move along.

75
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:43,098
Here, for my wife. Go and see her.

76
00:10:43,178 --> 00:10:46,808
We shall both get back and live with our wives again.

77
00:10:47,258 --> 00:10:50,378
Damn. Why don't they start?

78
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:56,048
Here. For my wife.

79
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:59,648
If she became a widow, let her marry my brother.

80
00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:29,208
Don't worry, my son, I will save you.

81
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:31,728
When we start. Stay close to me.

82
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:36,048
Let's go in the name of God.

83
00:12:31,138 --> 00:12:35,608
Good heavens. Father!

84
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:37,728
Father!

85
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:40,728
What's going to happen?

86
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:43,938
Don't worry. Ondrik!

87
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:45,738
Father!

88
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:49,698
Go away!

89
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:54,808
Come back. Our officers will shoot you to death!

90
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:03,808
Not a step more. Anyway. We are in Russia.

91
00:14:05,098 --> 00:14:08,528
- What are you saying? - Nothing.

92
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:13,888
I am to surrender, no matter what!

93
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:19,338
Bet the Russians are waiting for us with music.

94
00:15:41,498 --> 00:15:44,488
Oh my God. We have already been taken captive.

95
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:48,778
Who would have imagined the end will be so nice.

96
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:53,008
Our Lord performs miracles also in wartime.

97
00:15:53,898 --> 00:15:57,488
All right, let's go!

98
00:16:44,258 --> 00:16:47,768
My Lord, what have you allowed?

99
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:50,898
What a shame!

100
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:55,258
If I had a bullet, I would kill myself.

101
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:13,128
Halt!

102
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:17,938
Is this the way to bring prisoners?

103
00:17:18,018 --> 00:17:20,658
I shall teach you a lesson, band of tinkers!

104
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:23,618
Forward!

105
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:21,128
...I award the soldiers Kolibec and Mikles

106
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:27,178
four days off near the main camp.

107
00:18:27,258 --> 00:18:31,728
They start today at noon...

108
00:18:39,258 --> 00:18:41,818
Did you hear the story about the two tinkers?

109
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:43,728
They are said to have taken fourteen Russian prisoners!

110
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:45,968
- Two against fourteen? - People say.

111
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,208
Two tinkers entered the Russian positions last night

112
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:49,648
and took forty Russian prisoners!

113
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:51,458
A colonel among them too.

114
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:53,688
A colonel?! Two generals!

115
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:56,288
- The award - silver crosses. - And three stars each!

116
00:18:56,378 --> 00:18:59,288
They'll become members of the Emperor's Guards.

117
00:18:59,378 --> 00:19:03,768
Did you hear? Three stars each. That would suit us.

118
00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:06,048
Three slaps would suit us.

119
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:09,018
Look for a canteen. I'd like to wet my whistle.

120
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:12,088
Rum is the best!

121
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:10,048
Attention!

122
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:12,888
Get ready!

123
00:20:13,498 --> 00:20:16,298
Fire!

124
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:29,968
You should have been here three hours ago!

125
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:33,728
You may leave!

126
00:20:56,938 --> 00:21:00,608
I shall kill him.

127
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:06,608
Bloody war!

128
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,978
What have you done to people?

129
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:38,088
- What's wrong? - I can't go on.

130
00:22:41,978 --> 00:22:46,368
Lucky you. At least you'll go on leave.

131
00:22:50,498 --> 00:22:54,538
Forward!

132
00:22:54,938 --> 00:22:58,898
Victor. Don't leave me here! Don't go to Russia without me!

133
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,018
Stop talking such nonsense!

134
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:04,048
I am back in a minute to move you away.

135
00:23:10,538 --> 00:23:13,008
Here.

136
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:22,098
Forward!

137
00:25:34,778 --> 00:25:38,658
I see you are awake.

138
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,848
What is your name?

139
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:42,968
Where am I?

140
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:45,288
In the Orloff Guberniya now,

141
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:49,008
but once you are well, the tsar will invite you to Moscow.

142
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:53,248
Just breathe, Austrian, I am going to bring you gruel.

143
00:25:58,378 --> 00:26:01,048
Do you know me?

144
00:26:04,338 --> 00:26:07,928
I know you didn't mean to stab me.

145
00:26:09,218 --> 00:26:12,048
Neither did I.

146
00:26:12,498 --> 00:26:17,528
We are humans, why to kill?

147
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,858
Come here. Julka, I'll show you your Daddy.

148
00:29:49,778 --> 00:29:53,928
I don't want him!

149
00:29:54,018 --> 00:29:57,928
Give him your hand. He is your Dad.

150
00:29:58,018 --> 00:30:01,408
I don't want him!

151
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:08,088
Give me a razor to shave him.

152
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:14,778
Welcome. Mr. Kolibec. I am the mayor.

153
00:30:14,858 --> 00:30:18,568
I asked the medical officer to come in case it was typhoid.

154
00:30:18,658 --> 00:30:22,448
I have to report everybody from Russia.

155
00:30:22,538 --> 00:30:27,848
As we don't know the day or hour of our departures

156
00:30:27,938 --> 00:30:30,498
I am here with all the believers to...

157
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,538
No!

158
00:30:35,258 --> 00:30:40,488
In the presence of my father and my family I ask you

159
00:30:42,698 --> 00:30:44,728
to become my husband

160
00:30:44,818 --> 00:30:50,658
and I want to be your good wife forever.

161
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:57,648
My dear Julka...

162
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:15,208
First a little spirit, then shaving.

163
00:31:28,258 --> 00:31:31,328
- Anything wrong with him? - Yes.

164
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:33,728
I don't care.

165
00:31:33,818 --> 00:31:37,488
He hasn't registered and has a Russian uniform. In my view, he is a deserter.

166
00:31:37,578 --> 00:31:42,648
...to have and to hold. From this day forward.

167
00:31:42,738 --> 00:31:45,098
For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer,

168
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,450
in sickness and in health until death parts us.

169
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:53,928
That God has joined, men must not divide.

170
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:20,848
Dear Mr. Janciarik,

171
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:25,058
I feel like kicking your behind.

172
00:32:25,138 --> 00:32:26,968
I've been longing for that.

173
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:31,418
I know, Colonel. But you cannot.

174
00:32:31,498 --> 00:32:34,538
Who would bring you cognac,

175
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:39,528
cigars and something to your pocket? Be reasonable!

176
00:32:39,618 --> 00:32:42,498
- You are an old bastard. - I am.

177
00:32:42,578 --> 00:32:47,168
Sign it!

178
00:32:47,418 --> 00:32:52,568
The government will pay ten crowns more for a coffin.

179
00:32:52,658 --> 00:32:55,568
Everything is more expensive, why not funerals?

180
00:32:55,658 --> 00:32:57,408
Bloodsucker!

181
00:32:57,498 --> 00:33:01,968
You would prefer all in the camp to die.

182
00:33:02,058 --> 00:33:06,808
He who must die shall die. There is enough mob here.

183
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:12,768
How many dead do we expect tomorrow?

184
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,248
Go now, or I really kick you out.

185
00:33:15,338 --> 00:33:20,728
But Colonel... Thank you.

186
00:33:22,858 --> 00:33:28,448
Counts, Lords and Jews are not afraid of the war

187
00:33:44,618 --> 00:33:50,608
Since the Slovak boys shed their blood in the war.

188
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:11,368
I swear it is true!

189
00:34:11,698 --> 00:34:14,418
Hey. Buddy, come closer!

190
00:34:14,498 --> 00:34:19,088
- Is somebody dying? - Me. Come and cheer me up.

191
00:34:19,178 --> 00:34:21,938
You'd better not wish that. I am a gravedigger!

192
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:23,773
We shall meet at your funeral.

193
00:34:24,578 --> 00:34:27,138
Die. Die!

194
00:34:27,218 --> 00:34:32,898
Tono Mikles!

195
00:34:57,658 --> 00:35:00,648
For fuck's sake...

196
00:35:08,658 --> 00:35:12,008
This is a joke... You were killed!

197
00:35:12,098 --> 00:35:14,688
You too.

198
00:35:14,778 --> 00:35:17,688
Where have you been?

199
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:21,778
In hospitals, half a year on the Italian front

200
00:35:21,813 --> 00:35:23,813
and then here with typhoid fever.

201
00:35:23,898 --> 00:35:27,568
- How long have you been here? - Thirteen days.

202
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:32,328
You should have died long ago.

203
00:35:32,418 --> 00:35:35,888
- What is it? - Ulcer. They say.

204
00:35:36,578 --> 00:35:41,168
Let me see!

205
00:35:43,338 --> 00:35:48,698
Shit, not an ulcer! You're as fit as a fiddle!

206
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:52,098
Leave it to me. Doc.

207
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:56,538
And you. Why are you not in the workshop?

208
00:35:56,618 --> 00:36:01,818
Here... I found a very good craftsman.

209
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:05,098
He could work here.

210
00:36:05,698 --> 00:36:09,658
All right, I'll transfer him.

211
00:36:10,938 --> 00:36:13,848
What did I say? You are out of it.

212
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:18,648
He looks around and knows who to make a coffin for.

213
00:36:18,738 --> 00:36:22,568
He's already been here... vulture.

214
00:36:25,618 --> 00:36:31,608
- What have you got with him? - Me? Well...

215
00:36:34,338 --> 00:36:36,768
Stop staring, or I'll smash your face!

216
00:36:58,098 --> 00:37:02,408
The snooper's coming! Let's run away!

217
00:37:32,378 --> 00:37:35,688
Don't show me corpses. I need men!

218
00:37:35,778 --> 00:37:37,928
I am showing what I have. Captain.

219
00:37:38,018 --> 00:37:40,688
A real mess. The emperor needs soldiers

220
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:43,048
and here - fifteen men die every day.

221
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:48,578
- We lack drugs. - For heaven's sake. Get it!

222
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:54,458
You will provide me with fifty men by the evening!

223
00:37:56,498 --> 00:38:01,568
I don't want cognac, my father has three distilleries.

224
00:38:01,658 --> 00:38:04,968
What beastly stuff!

225
00:38:41,978 --> 00:38:46,888
You didn't want to do it yourself, now you have to.

226
00:38:46,978 --> 00:38:49,808
- Shut up! - You shut up!

227
00:38:49,938 --> 00:38:53,168
You are safe here. Janciarik will save us from the front.

228
00:38:53,258 --> 00:38:55,248
I don't care!

229
00:38:55,338 --> 00:38:59,008
You are like him. Both of you use the war to make money.

230
00:38:59,498 --> 00:39:01,008
Asshole!

231
00:39:01,098 --> 00:39:04,008
I have nothing from it but he has already bought two houses.

232
00:39:04,098 --> 00:39:07,448
While there are jerks like you. He will buy a third one.

233
00:39:07,538 --> 00:39:11,288
All right. Viktor. All right.

234
00:39:11,978 --> 00:39:15,128
Take a brush and paint!

235
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:19,968
- I'd rather die. - Just wait with dying.

236
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:22,778
Somebody's waiting behind the wire.

237
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:25,088
Misko. Come here!

238
00:39:25,178 --> 00:39:27,928
Come on. Don't worry!

239
00:39:29,418 --> 00:39:33,378
Two nickels for you, accompany him to the fence.

240
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:36,098
Follow me.

241
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:18,338
I am glad to see you at least.

242
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:21,008
I've looked for you very long!

243
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:24,648
Thank God you are healthy.

244
00:40:24,738 --> 00:40:28,808
I have some cake for you.

245
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:32,488
Help yourself!

246
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:37,578
The guard has noticed us!

247
00:40:58,178 --> 00:41:02,458
All right, buddy.

248
00:41:03,498 --> 00:41:08,328
Speak. Say anything, I just want to hear you.

249
00:41:08,418 --> 00:41:13,128
- What's the news at home? - Bad times. Poverty, hunger.

250
00:41:13,218 --> 00:41:16,968
They take everything. There's nobody to protect us.

251
00:41:17,418 --> 00:41:20,168
What about us?

252
00:41:20,738 --> 00:41:24,088
People say the war will go on.

253
00:41:24,938 --> 00:41:29,448
Bring some clothes tomorrow, I am going to flee.

254
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:33,888
Clothes for two, also for my companion.

255
00:41:33,978 --> 00:41:38,258
Wait here tomorrow in the evening.

256
00:42:16,738 --> 00:42:19,458
A good wife.

257
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:24,058
Mine will not bake for me ever again.

258
00:42:24,138 --> 00:42:27,128
Why not?

259
00:42:27,218 --> 00:42:30,728
How to tell you?

260
00:42:32,298 --> 00:42:37,658
It's been two years I am gone and now my son was born.

261
00:42:39,338 --> 00:42:45,048
- No more troubles then. - The only thing to please me.

262
00:42:45,138 --> 00:42:49,048
We run away tomorrow.

263
00:42:50,218 --> 00:42:53,848
What? Where shall we run?

264
00:42:56,738 --> 00:43:00,088
Take everything out!

265
00:43:01,938 --> 00:43:07,168
- How is this one doing? - Perfectly! He is a skilled painter!

266
00:43:09,498 --> 00:43:14,968
It's a pity I can't keep you here.

267
00:43:15,298 --> 00:43:19,928
There are battles on all fronts.

268
00:43:20,178 --> 00:43:23,008
Now that everything begins so well.

269
00:43:23,098 --> 00:43:26,568
Sixteen dead today.

270
00:43:26,658 --> 00:43:31,248
I wish the war lasted at least three years longer!

271
00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:39,008
You bastard! Do you know whom you?

272
00:44:15,218 --> 00:44:17,018
Assholes!

273
00:44:37,178 --> 00:44:40,408
Calaga Jan. Step forward!

274
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:43,688
Bachleda Jozef. Step forward!

275
00:44:43,778 --> 00:44:46,338
Kolibec Viktor... step!

276
00:45:32,018 --> 00:45:35,448
We only eat at command, did you forget?

277
00:45:35,538 --> 00:45:36,968
Yes, I did.

278
00:45:37,058 --> 00:45:39,208
What will you eat during the journey?

279
00:45:39,298 --> 00:45:41,768
Emperor will take care of me.

280
00:45:41,858 --> 00:45:44,368
I'll have a thundering good time.

281
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:47,688
Is that why he transports you in the pig wagon?

282
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:53,218
Why are the old soldiers transported like pigs?

283
00:45:56,778 --> 00:45:59,368
And I... Why did he come here?

284
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:03,498
He may begin to smell foul!

285
00:46:03,578 --> 00:46:08,128
One day. A certain captain Adler came into our wagon.

286
00:46:08,218 --> 00:46:10,688
The Italians were driving us out of Monte Grappa.

287
00:46:10,778 --> 00:46:14,688
Too crowded, so the captain was with us.

288
00:46:14,778 --> 00:46:19,768
We were glad because he had been mean.

289
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:24,528
There was a lamp like the one here.

290
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:30,648
Light suddenly went out.

291
00:46:30,738 --> 00:46:34,368
And in the darkness, who knows how.

292
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:40,408
The captain suffocated to death.

293
00:46:43,378 --> 00:46:46,648
I know who killed him.

294
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:50,888
I was in the wagon. Tono Mikles.

295
00:46:52,578 --> 00:46:57,288
- I did not do that. - I know.

296
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:01,338
You heard it but now you're boasting here.

297
00:47:01,898 --> 00:47:04,048
From now on. You needn't lie.

298
00:47:04,138 --> 00:47:07,408
Now I tell you who strangled captain Adler.

299
00:47:07,498 --> 00:47:10,058
The dead ones did.

300
00:47:10,298 --> 00:47:14,738
The hundreds of soldiers he sent to the grave.

301
00:47:16,058 --> 00:47:21,048
And the survivors witnessed he had had a stroke.

302
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:26,928
I know you! Matej Frujak!

303
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:33,288
You were a lance corporal then and didn't wear a moustache.

304
00:47:35,178 --> 00:47:39,888
Let's speak as equals now.

305
00:47:39,978 --> 00:47:43,568
Wait. Corporal! We are not equal.

306
00:47:43,658 --> 00:47:45,298
They believe you. Not us.

307
00:47:45,378 --> 00:47:48,208
They let you have a gun. We haven't even got bayonets.

308
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:51,528
Don't take it to heart, we all will be sent to the front line.

309
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:55,608
What if we say: Enough!?

310
00:47:56,338 --> 00:47:59,538
Those who said it are dead.

311
00:47:59,618 --> 00:48:01,768
Those who betrayed them ended worse!

312
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:05,008
- Remember that! - I shall.

313
00:48:05,938 --> 00:48:10,138
I'll think of it when you are being hanged.

314
00:48:10,218 --> 00:48:12,858
We stopped.

315
00:48:14,738 --> 00:48:16,458
Let them let us out. I want to go out!

316
00:48:16,538 --> 00:48:17,408
You only?

317
00:48:17,498 --> 00:48:20,698
Open. Corporal! We are not animals to be locked here.

318
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:25,168
I only can open it at the captain's command.

319
00:48:25,258 --> 00:48:28,328
Go and ask him to give the order!

320
00:48:28,418 --> 00:48:31,218
And we want warm meals! And drinkable water!

321
00:48:31,298 --> 00:48:35,498
Ask him if we shall piss our pants!

322
00:48:44,298 --> 00:48:47,288
Two of you accompany me.

323
00:48:47,378 --> 00:48:51,288
You and the hero of Monte Grappa.

324
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:15,848
Captain. Corporal Frujak reports to you!

325
00:49:15,938 --> 00:49:17,448
Good.

326
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:21,288
- And what about these two? - The ranks' representatives.

327
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:25,208
They ask warm meals and drinkable water.

328
00:49:25,298 --> 00:49:28,848
Lo and behold!

329
00:49:47,498 --> 00:49:50,408
Thank you.

330
00:50:11,058 --> 00:50:15,568
How many we are! What a force!

331
00:50:40,098 --> 00:50:42,408
I will come earlier. Prepare a bath for me.

332
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:43,528
Yes. Sir!

333
00:50:43,618 --> 00:50:47,928
Do not forget, or I'll punish you!

334
00:50:50,218 --> 00:50:52,528
Punish...

335
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:04,488
Marica, are you going?

336
00:51:04,738 --> 00:51:09,488
- Where to? - To the station to welcome our people.

337
00:51:09,578 --> 00:51:13,968
- Your people? - The Slovaks. Soldiers!

338
00:51:14,058 --> 00:51:18,128
Soldiers again!

339
00:51:18,578 --> 00:51:21,218
Maybe somebody familiar will come

340
00:51:21,298 --> 00:51:23,858
and will tell me how my mother is.

341
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:37,048
All right. Go.

342
00:51:40,738 --> 00:51:43,808
Why does she like him?

343
00:51:45,218 --> 00:51:47,408
Excuse me...

344
00:51:49,978 --> 00:51:52,248
Hello, Ervin.

345
00:51:53,218 --> 00:51:54,778
Hello, Ervin.

346
00:51:54,858 --> 00:51:57,168
I report my arrival from the camp recruitment.

347
00:51:57,258 --> 00:51:59,408
Have a seat and speak.

348
00:51:59,498 --> 00:52:02,218
The convoy has arrived.

349
00:52:02,298 --> 00:52:04,328
I know. How many pieces?

350
00:52:04,418 --> 00:52:07,008
- Five hundred and three. - Later, Ervin.

351
00:52:07,098 --> 00:52:08,248
All right.

352
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:10,978
Danica, cognac please!

353
00:52:11,058 --> 00:52:12,538
No! Turkish coffee!

354
00:52:12,618 --> 00:52:13,688
Ervin is good.

355
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:24,138
Ervin is back. And the convoy is here.

356
00:52:24,218 --> 00:52:27,488
Five hundred and three pieces.

357
00:52:31,298 --> 00:52:37,208
The decay is obvious everywhere. The camps are full of Bolsheviks.

358
00:52:37,298 --> 00:52:41,128
No fear! We shall clip their wings!

359
00:52:41,218 --> 00:52:43,208
Austria is not Russia.

360
00:52:43,298 --> 00:52:46,728
There will be alarm tomorrow, and then down and up,

361
00:52:46,818 --> 00:52:48,378
down and up!

362
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:50,848
In two days, they will lick our hands.

363
00:52:50,938 --> 00:52:55,888
But do not forget to isolate the recruits!

364
00:52:55,978 --> 00:52:59,938
I have them over a barrel, major. So firmly.

365
00:53:11,498 --> 00:53:15,538
- Anybody from Priechod? - Nobody knows but God!

366
00:53:15,618 --> 00:53:18,258
What about somebody from Rajec?

367
00:53:18,338 --> 00:53:20,898
- Are you from Rajec? - Why?

368
00:53:20,978 --> 00:53:26,848
- Do you know the teacher Pagac? - So you're his son!

369
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:30,008
You have grown!

370
00:53:30,578 --> 00:53:33,968
- I shall come and see you. - Do please.

371
00:53:34,698 --> 00:53:37,498
- Who is it? - I have never seen him

372
00:53:37,578 --> 00:53:39,728
but he can be of use.

373
00:53:39,818 --> 00:53:42,288
Who are they, young lady?

374
00:53:42,378 --> 00:53:45,688
The Tatra boys. The Slovaks!

375
00:53:45,858 --> 00:53:48,848
A long journey. Poor boys, they must be hungry.

376
00:53:48,938 --> 00:53:53,928
Hand them this, it suits you better.

377
00:53:54,018 --> 00:53:56,288
Do it, I feel ashamed.

378
00:53:56,378 --> 00:53:58,568
What of? Look!

379
00:53:58,858 --> 00:54:00,688
Catch!

380
00:54:01,218 --> 00:54:04,178
We got some snack!

381
00:54:09,058 --> 00:54:10,728
A nice welcome by Kragujevac.

382
00:54:10,818 --> 00:54:13,808
They could have used clean paper.

383
00:54:13,898 --> 00:54:15,778
Wait!

384
00:54:15,858 --> 00:54:18,498
It is not ordinary paper.

385
00:54:18,578 --> 00:54:22,648
Brothers! Refuse to fight for Austria-Hungary.

386
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:26,648
Go over to the Serbians!

387
00:54:28,058 --> 00:54:31,448
Gosh. What a Serbian snack!

388
00:54:31,538 --> 00:54:36,208
- Was the parcel from you? - Oh no! From the Serbians!

389
00:54:49,898 --> 00:54:54,098
We had enough poverty and hunger.

390
00:54:54,498 --> 00:54:59,408
Think of your tearful mothers, wives and children!

391
00:54:59,498 --> 00:55:02,458
Stop this fratricidal war!

392
00:55:02,538 --> 00:55:05,418
Stop bloodshed!

393
00:55:05,498 --> 00:55:08,648
Brothers. Lay down your arms! The Serbian Guerrilla Committee.

394
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:10,888
- What arms? - The pocket knives.

395
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:13,618
- What about our bare hands? - Nothing.

396
00:55:13,698 --> 00:55:16,768
But we must know what to do when we get rifles.

397
00:55:16,858 --> 00:55:19,448
Nothing. We won't get them before we're in the front line.

398
00:55:19,538 --> 00:55:22,608
If we let them send us there.

399
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:24,608
Of course, one man can do nothing.

400
00:55:24,698 --> 00:55:27,898
If all of us say no, they can't force us.

401
00:55:27,978 --> 00:55:29,698
That's it. To become united!

402
00:55:29,778 --> 00:55:31,448
The Serbians are in the mountains and hold on.

403
00:55:31,538 --> 00:55:34,968
They are at home but we don't know the surroundings.

404
00:55:35,058 --> 00:55:39,608
There are people hating the war as much as we do!

405
00:55:39,698 --> 00:55:41,608
Here it is!

406
00:55:41,698 --> 00:55:43,848
Attention!

407
00:55:49,818 --> 00:55:54,368
I am looking... for... an acquaintance.

408
00:55:55,338 --> 00:55:57,138
Welcome. Compatriot!

409
00:55:57,218 --> 00:56:00,338
How are you? Have you been here long?

410
00:56:00,418 --> 00:56:03,928
Over half a year. As a typist in the command.

411
00:56:06,258 --> 00:56:09,378
It is up there. Isn't it?

412
00:56:09,458 --> 00:56:11,128
Yes.

413
00:56:11,738 --> 00:56:15,128
Why are there the two machine guns in the windows?

414
00:56:15,218 --> 00:56:16,968
I do not know.

415
00:56:17,058 --> 00:56:20,368
And when shall we be sent to the front line?

416
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:21,448
I do not know.

417
00:56:21,538 --> 00:56:23,288
Don't ask me.

418
00:56:23,378 --> 00:56:26,888
In any case. I must be going. I am on duty.

419
00:56:28,458 --> 00:56:31,418
Attention!

420
00:56:33,058 --> 00:56:36,648
- Well? - We are like in prison.

421
00:56:36,738 --> 00:56:38,888
Neither we nor the recruits are allowed to go to town.

422
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:41,008
They fear we'll get lost.

423
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:43,658
- How many recruits? - The whole company.

424
00:56:43,738 --> 00:56:45,848
The kids who are forbidden to talk to us.

425
00:56:45,938 --> 00:56:47,498
Not to dull their minds.

426
00:56:47,578 --> 00:56:49,728
We are about four hundred.

427
00:56:49,818 --> 00:56:52,538
Most of us from the Russian captivity.

428
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:55,368
None of us will go to the front line.

429
00:56:57,218 --> 00:56:58,448
I like that.

430
00:56:58,538 --> 00:57:04,408
We all agree about not going to the front line.

431
00:57:04,978 --> 00:57:08,688
But while the two machine guns are aimed at us,

432
00:57:08,778 --> 00:57:11,168
when we stand in the yard as firm as a rock.

433
00:57:11,258 --> 00:57:13,648
The two guns will knock us down!

434
00:57:13,738 --> 00:57:18,208
What of it? The machine guns! I shall steal them tonight!

435
00:57:18,298 --> 00:57:20,018
And put them under the pillow, nobody will notice that.

436
00:57:20,098 --> 00:57:24,168
It's a pity you are not a general. The war might have been over.

437
00:57:24,258 --> 00:57:27,848
The machine guns cannot disappear

438
00:57:27,938 --> 00:57:30,658
but the pins from them can.

439
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:33,248
The machine gun cannot shoot without the pin.

440
00:57:33,338 --> 00:57:35,058
What brains!

441
00:57:35,138 --> 00:57:38,808
I would like to see the dupe who will dare to remove them!

442
00:57:38,898 --> 00:57:42,888
I know a man who wanted to steal the whole guns.

443
00:57:42,978 --> 00:57:45,728
First, we must copy the leaflet.

444
00:57:45,778 --> 00:57:49,128
Get paper. Letters, or something like that.

445
00:57:49,218 --> 00:57:51,288
Where shall we get paper?

446
00:57:51,378 --> 00:57:55,928
Tono is the only one who can get it.

447
00:58:00,938 --> 00:58:03,208
Assholes...

448
00:58:13,738 --> 00:58:15,888
What's the matter?

449
00:58:17,898 --> 00:58:22,338
I wonder why you are dumb in the evenings.

450
00:58:23,098 --> 00:58:26,768
You haven't finished talking about this miracle.

451
00:58:26,858 --> 00:58:29,448
Don't you believe it is gold?

452
00:58:29,538 --> 00:58:32,098
I do but you said it was magic,

453
00:58:32,178 --> 00:58:34,608
it fell from the heavens down to your grandfather.

454
00:58:34,698 --> 00:58:37,448
Well. From the heavens...

455
00:58:37,538 --> 00:58:40,848
My grandfather... he was young then...

456
00:58:40,938 --> 00:58:45,058
he had neither a cow nor a goat. But a magpie.

457
00:58:45,138 --> 00:58:48,128
- A magpie? - Magpie. The bird.

458
00:58:48,218 --> 00:58:51,128
They were so poor they wanted to eat it.

459
00:58:51,218 --> 00:58:53,778
One day. The magpie returned

460
00:58:53,858 --> 00:58:58,088
and left this ring on the windowsill.

461
00:58:58,178 --> 00:59:01,928
Then my grandfather's life turned out for the best.

462
00:59:02,018 --> 00:59:06,248
He gave the ring to my mother. She gave it to me

463
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:09,408
and I will give it...

464
00:59:10,698 --> 00:59:14,168
The night guards are having a good time.

465
00:59:15,898 --> 00:59:18,698
We'd better go in.

466
00:59:19,978 --> 00:59:21,488
Don't worry, I am here!

467
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:15,658
Come in!

468
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:24,728
Branko! Get in. Fast!

469
01:00:37,618 --> 01:00:40,338
Branko...

470
01:00:53,058 --> 01:00:57,338
Go out! Slow them up if they came back!

471
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:18,368
Your brother?

472
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:21,368
I suspected Branko was with the guerrilla fighters.

473
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:27,248
You must help us. We must get him to safety.

474
01:01:35,098 --> 01:01:36,658
Well, see you!

475
01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:39,208
Don't get up, the horses get startled.

476
01:01:39,298 --> 01:01:43,128
- See you! - Let's go, Pista!

477
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:59,098
Do you fear your date will be hijacked?

478
01:02:01,538 --> 01:02:03,448
Major. Are we going to search the garden.

479
01:02:03,538 --> 01:02:05,418
We are looking for a dangerous guerrilla.

480
01:02:05,498 --> 01:02:08,218
Guerrilla?

481
01:02:08,378 --> 01:02:10,688
Here he is! Take him!

482
01:02:10,778 --> 01:02:13,738
This is where major Von Dreznik,

483
01:02:13,818 --> 01:02:17,648
a terror of Serbian guerrillas. Is staying.

484
01:02:17,738 --> 01:02:20,778
I had six of them hanged the day before yesterday.

485
01:02:20,858 --> 01:02:23,448
Leave!

486
01:02:39,218 --> 01:02:41,408
More water.

487
01:03:02,538 --> 01:03:03,728
Why is my bath not ready?

488
01:03:04,898 --> 01:03:07,778
Why is my bath not ready?

489
01:03:08,058 --> 01:03:10,008
Sorry. I forgot.

490
01:03:10,098 --> 01:03:14,008
- Not to forget again! - Major. Please!

491
01:03:14,098 --> 01:03:17,298
Pack up and go to the barracks!

492
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:21,578
Tomorrow you begin to work with the Bolsheviks!

493
01:03:42,498 --> 01:03:44,968
Inspection Officer.

494
01:03:47,138 --> 01:03:51,528
- Come in. Tono. - Coming.

495
01:04:02,178 --> 01:04:05,168
Wait here, in case somebody enters.

496
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:08,138
All right.

497
01:04:26,298 --> 01:04:29,608
Here you are. Envelopes too.

498
01:04:29,698 --> 01:04:34,168
There are many of us who want to write our wives.

499
01:04:34,258 --> 01:04:37,728
- If you can. 50 at least... - All right, I fetch more.

500
01:04:37,818 --> 01:04:40,248
And some ink into a bottle!

501
01:04:40,338 --> 01:04:41,898
- And a pen! - All right!

502
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:45,368
My Lord, help me!

503
01:04:48,378 --> 01:04:53,288
- I haven't got a small bottle! - Try to find!

504
01:04:56,938 --> 01:04:59,498
- I've got it! - So have I.

505
01:04:59,778 --> 01:05:03,528
Where there's a will there's a way!

506
01:05:03,618 --> 01:05:07,448
- Bad to work in the dark. - It is!

507
01:05:07,538 --> 01:05:11,688
Cripes. A swine slept here!

508
01:05:17,818 --> 01:05:20,378
- Oh, here you are! - Here.

509
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:23,098
Here.

510
01:05:23,538 --> 01:05:26,178
Thank you.

511
01:05:44,178 --> 01:05:48,488
Play a merrier one. Or leave it!

512
01:05:55,178 --> 01:05:58,448
Well, you are real poltroons!

513
01:06:01,578 --> 01:06:03,688
Here you are. Wiseacres.

514
01:06:04,098 --> 01:06:06,288
Write the leaflets.

515
01:06:07,018 --> 01:06:12,568
Not to drag me through the mud anymore, here are the pins.

516
01:06:21,298 --> 01:06:24,418
Is this how you enter?

517
01:06:24,498 --> 01:06:27,538
The soldiers Durica a Badanik report arrival.

518
01:06:27,658 --> 01:06:28,728
That's the way.

519
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:36,048
Choose whichever you want.

520
01:06:49,858 --> 01:06:53,288
I bet it is him.

521
01:07:09,338 --> 01:07:14,688
We saw a pretty girl at the station.

522
01:07:17,178 --> 01:07:20,138
We wondered what her name was.

523
01:07:20,898 --> 01:07:25,568
One said Anna. Another Jelka,

524
01:07:27,658 --> 01:07:30,648
and the third one Katka...

525
01:07:32,778 --> 01:07:35,898
Marica.

526
01:07:50,298 --> 01:07:52,768
Company. Down! Up! Down!

527
01:07:52,858 --> 01:07:54,808
Up!

528
01:07:55,778 --> 01:07:57,928
One. Two!

529
01:07:58,018 --> 01:08:00,608
Down!

530
01:08:00,698 --> 01:08:02,368
Up!

531
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:03,858
At the double!

532
01:08:03,938 --> 01:08:06,528
One, two...

533
01:08:06,978 --> 01:08:09,088
About turn!

534
01:08:13,378 --> 01:08:16,098
What is it, you bastard!

535
01:08:16,178 --> 01:08:18,608
- Where is sugar? - Be reasonable!

536
01:08:18,698 --> 01:08:22,738
I cook from the ingredients I get. Ask the officers where the sugar is!

537
01:09:04,498 --> 01:09:08,168
Major. I report the first battalion is drilling.

538
01:09:08,258 --> 01:09:10,898
There are 11 officers and 290 men present.

539
01:09:10,978 --> 01:09:13,858
What is the next order?

540
01:09:24,938 --> 01:09:28,608
The mob can make an awful scene

541
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:31,448
but if a grenade blew up nobody could catch them!

542
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,808
Quick march! One, two!

543
01:09:41,338 --> 01:09:44,378
Right turn!

544
01:09:46,618 --> 01:09:49,888
Order arms!

545
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:53,408
Nice, boys!

546
01:09:53,498 --> 01:09:57,168
When the Italians see you, they will be scared to death.

547
01:09:58,138 --> 01:10:00,448
About turn!

548
01:10:01,738 --> 01:10:04,298
Shoulder arms!

549
01:10:06,738 --> 01:10:09,728
- There was not time enough. - About turn!

550
01:10:11,578 --> 01:10:14,218
Straight ahead!

551
01:10:14,938 --> 01:10:17,208
Company halt!

552
01:10:17,298 --> 01:10:20,728
Prepare to shoot!

553
01:10:21,298 --> 01:10:26,208
Aim! Order arms!

554
01:10:26,898 --> 01:10:30,528
- Now, the speech. - Yeah. Brainwashing.

555
01:10:33,018 --> 01:10:38,218
I praise the fourth company for the nice drill!

556
01:10:39,378 --> 01:10:42,848
Such soldiers are not scared of the enemy.

557
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:46,008
Your discipline is a paragon.

558
01:10:46,858 --> 01:10:51,008
The old company will show even better discipline.

559
01:10:51,258 --> 01:10:53,208
They need not feel ashamed.

560
01:10:53,298 --> 01:10:55,728
- They need not! - Give us proper food!

561
01:10:55,858 --> 01:10:56,928
We're starving!

562
01:10:57,018 --> 01:10:58,968
We want to go on leave as the Hungarian infantry!

563
01:10:59,058 --> 01:11:01,858
Stop the war like in Russia!

564
01:11:05,418 --> 01:11:07,568
Step forward!

565
01:11:07,658 --> 01:11:11,288
Those who want leaves. Step forward!

566
01:11:13,818 --> 01:11:16,968
Nobody? Good!

567
01:11:18,498 --> 01:11:21,928
The old company, down!

568
01:11:23,098 --> 01:11:25,328
Up!

569
01:11:26,178 --> 01:11:28,528
Down!

570
01:11:29,058 --> 01:11:31,248
Up!

571
01:11:32,058 --> 01:11:34,528
Down!

572
01:11:35,058 --> 01:11:37,008
Up!

573
01:11:37,938 --> 01:11:40,528
Down!

574
01:11:41,018 --> 01:11:43,328
Up!

575
01:11:45,698 --> 01:11:48,898
Get up! Up!

576
01:11:49,178 --> 01:11:52,088
Son of a gun. Up!

577
01:11:53,658 --> 01:11:55,968
Don't be silly, boy!

578
01:11:56,098 --> 01:11:59,648
I won't get up. They must kill me!

579
01:12:03,938 --> 01:12:06,498
Batman Badanik, step forward!

580
01:12:06,578 --> 01:12:09,138
You too! You too!

581
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:18,928
- What did the batman say? - I don't know.

582
01:12:20,898 --> 01:12:22,128
What did he say?

583
01:12:22,978 --> 01:12:26,048
Quiet!

584
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:37,848
I won't punish this case but mind your mouth!

585
01:12:38,338 --> 01:12:41,218
I am responsible for you to the emperor.

586
01:12:41,538 --> 01:12:43,688
Leave!

587
01:12:48,738 --> 01:12:53,018
- What crossed your mind? - I didn't want him

588
01:12:53,098 --> 01:12:54,928
to maltreat you because of me.

589
01:12:55,018 --> 01:12:58,928
But next time hold out your face.

590
01:12:59,138 --> 01:13:03,968
At the double. And down!

591
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:09,688
You will remember this. Bolshevik mob!

592
01:13:09,778 --> 01:13:12,658
You will find out what captain Deutsch is like!

593
01:13:12,738 --> 01:13:17,098
Bloody tinkers and woodcutters!

594
01:13:19,698 --> 01:13:21,888
Give the recruits cartridges!

595
01:13:23,338 --> 01:13:26,248
Ervin, don't be silly.

596
01:13:30,258 --> 01:13:32,138
One. Two! One. Two!

597
01:13:32,218 --> 01:13:34,568
Down!

598
01:13:36,338 --> 01:13:38,528
Up!

599
01:13:38,618 --> 01:13:40,888
At the double!

600
01:13:49,738 --> 01:13:51,538
Down!

601
01:13:51,738 --> 01:13:53,248
Up!

602
01:13:53,338 --> 01:13:56,928
At the double!

603
01:13:59,258 --> 01:14:01,608
Together, men!

604
01:14:02,378 --> 01:14:04,128
Given a whistle. We stop.

605
01:14:04,218 --> 01:14:09,928
- Given a whistle. We stop... - Given a whistle. We stop...

606
01:14:11,138 --> 01:14:12,888
One. Two! One. Two!

607
01:14:12,978 --> 01:14:15,128
Down!

608
01:14:15,898 --> 01:14:17,698
Up!

609
01:14:17,778 --> 01:14:19,848
Get up!

610
01:14:19,938 --> 01:14:23,138
For fuck's sake. Up!

611
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:28,728
Fuck you, up!

612
01:15:02,818 --> 01:15:06,328
At the double!

613
01:15:10,018 --> 01:15:15,538
Men, stay calm. Wait for the whistle.

614
01:15:16,498 --> 01:15:20,648
Wait for the whistle.

615
01:15:26,138 --> 01:15:28,288
Company halt!

616
01:15:34,578 --> 01:15:38,568
The old company, down!

617
01:15:40,418 --> 01:15:43,928
The fourth company, get ready!

618
01:15:46,058 --> 01:15:48,858
Aim!

619
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:58,658
The old company, down!

620
01:16:02,898 --> 01:16:07,048
The old company. The last time. Down!

621
01:16:13,378 --> 01:16:18,688
The fourth company. Fire!

622
01:16:47,098 --> 01:16:51,808
Oh. Jehovah Adonai...

623
01:17:08,738 --> 01:17:12,048
The fourth company, get ready!

624
01:17:13,178 --> 01:17:16,488
Company, quick march!

625
01:17:19,818 --> 01:17:22,858
The old company. At my command,

626
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:31,728
muster!

627
01:17:37,178 --> 01:17:40,768
Quick march!

628
01:18:00,778 --> 01:18:03,978
- Why are you so chirpy? - We are resurrected!

629
01:18:04,058 --> 01:18:05,888
And I was socked on the jaw!

630
01:18:05,978 --> 01:18:07,568
Hello, old man!

631
01:18:07,658 --> 01:18:10,458
- Where are you staying? - Here, at Grosnica. In the old manor house.

632
01:18:10,538 --> 01:18:12,848
Good, we'll come and see you.

633
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,088
Here, give this to our men.

634
01:18:15,178 --> 01:18:18,168
The password is The Tinkers. In case...

635
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:20,768
What case?

636
01:18:24,898 --> 01:18:27,458
Oh my!

637
01:18:30,058 --> 01:18:32,618
It's a scandal!

638
01:18:34,338 --> 01:18:37,728
Such an officer must be taken to court martial!

639
01:18:37,818 --> 01:18:40,888
I should slap your face and rip off your stars!

640
01:18:42,498 --> 01:18:44,378
Stay in the barracks on Sunday.

641
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:47,018
I don't care if the Bolsheviks beat you up.

642
01:18:47,098 --> 01:18:51,408
On Monday, you will present the rebels. Now leave!

643
01:18:52,578 --> 01:18:54,808
Wait!

644
01:18:56,498 --> 01:19:00,458
It is Colonel's birthday today. We are invited.

645
01:19:00,818 --> 01:19:05,728
You will stay for an hour. No word about today's case!

646
01:19:16,578 --> 01:19:18,848
Pagac!

647
01:19:33,538 --> 01:19:37,608
My dear wife, I am a long way from you,

648
01:19:37,698 --> 01:19:43,058
but I will come back even from the very end of the earth.

649
01:19:46,658 --> 01:19:48,538
How is it going, boys?

650
01:19:48,618 --> 01:19:52,168
Don't worry, you'll be all right.

651
01:19:52,258 --> 01:19:56,698
You'll go home soon. Go to join your folks.

652
01:19:57,218 --> 01:20:01,848
Viktor, come and see this!

653
01:20:09,098 --> 01:20:10,978
Have your hand and foot ever been bound?

654
01:20:11,058 --> 01:20:14,408
- Why? - I just wonder.

655
01:20:14,498 --> 01:20:18,618
These men do it perfectly.

656
01:20:22,338 --> 01:20:23,368
What is their intention?

657
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:25,968
The tinkers will probably be awarded medals.

658
01:20:26,058 --> 01:20:28,938
Men, we are locked up!

659
01:20:29,018 --> 01:20:32,248
The corridor door is locked!

660
01:20:38,258 --> 01:20:43,618
And I aimed at him all the time.

661
01:20:44,498 --> 01:20:49,368
When the lieutenant stood about twenty steps ahead,

662
01:20:49,418 --> 01:20:52,568
I pulled the trigger and!

663
01:20:53,538 --> 01:20:56,128
Wake up!

664
01:20:59,018 --> 01:21:02,138
- Does Hojdak stay here? - Here!

665
01:21:02,218 --> 01:21:06,728
Captain wants to talk to you.

666
01:21:07,138 --> 01:21:12,008
Excuse me. With his mouth or hands?

667
01:21:12,818 --> 01:21:15,728
You are asked to come too.

668
01:21:17,418 --> 01:21:20,138
You are asked to come too. - Here!

669
01:21:21,178 --> 01:21:23,768
I am looking for you too.

670
01:21:26,378 --> 01:21:29,018
Well. Let's go.

671
01:21:35,338 --> 01:21:39,538
- Where are you going? - Out. To post a letter.

672
01:21:39,618 --> 01:21:44,058
You mustn't go to town! Come back!

673
01:21:45,218 --> 01:21:47,128
Assholes!

674
01:21:47,698 --> 01:21:50,258
Aside. Mob!

675
01:21:51,218 --> 01:21:56,128
Captain offers us a glass of wine and a talk.

676
01:21:58,178 --> 01:22:02,168
Go there or write. Here is the address.

677
01:22:02,258 --> 01:22:06,048
Tell her not to worry.

678
01:22:59,138 --> 01:23:01,858
Well!

679
01:23:02,338 --> 01:23:06,698
Who whistled in the parade ground?

680
01:23:08,778 --> 01:23:11,738
Do you know or don't you?

681
01:23:11,818 --> 01:23:13,378
- I don't. - I don't.

682
01:23:13,458 --> 01:23:15,608
- I don't.

683
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:29,928
Don't you?

684
01:23:48,298 --> 01:23:52,968
Tell our men the things...

685
01:23:53,058 --> 01:23:54,858
Quiet!

686
01:23:54,938 --> 01:23:57,928
...are under my mattress.

687
01:23:58,258 --> 01:24:01,218
We need men to force open the weapon storeroom door.

688
01:24:01,298 --> 01:24:03,018
Are you crazy? It is an uprising!

689
01:24:03,098 --> 01:24:04,368
It has begun this morning.

690
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:06,728
If we stop we shall be killed one by one.

691
01:24:06,818 --> 01:24:08,968
Don't be silly! They are not to be hanged.

692
01:24:09,058 --> 01:24:12,648
Tono and Hojdak can manage, but the boy will not stand it.

693
01:24:26,298 --> 01:24:28,608
Let's go!

694
01:24:35,098 --> 01:24:40,698
Don't suffer for somebody else. Say who it was.

695
01:24:47,818 --> 01:24:50,778
This is for you to recall!

696
01:24:51,018 --> 01:24:53,488
- Asshole! - What did you?

697
01:24:53,578 --> 01:24:55,848
Asshole!

698
01:24:56,018 --> 01:24:59,168
Asshole!

699
01:25:09,698 --> 01:25:12,658
Don't beat him!

700
01:25:12,738 --> 01:25:15,618
Don't beat him, I know who it was!

701
01:25:17,258 --> 01:25:21,248
Don't beat him, I know who it was!

702
01:25:23,138 --> 01:25:25,328
Who? His name?

703
01:25:25,418 --> 01:25:29,618
I don't know but I can show you.

704
01:25:34,098 --> 01:25:36,488
Let's force open the storeroom door!

705
01:25:36,578 --> 01:25:40,858
What shall we do if there is no rifle?

706
01:25:40,938 --> 01:25:43,168
- The recruits have them. - But without cartridges.

707
01:25:43,258 --> 01:25:44,928
The recruits are locked up.

708
01:25:45,018 --> 01:25:47,408
We must let them out.

709
01:25:47,498 --> 01:25:50,168
Hojdak is being escorted.

710
01:25:55,698 --> 01:25:58,688
Men. Disperse!

711
01:26:26,338 --> 01:26:31,768
Friends. They are beating us!

712
01:26:35,058 --> 01:26:36,458
Not so loudly!

713
01:26:36,538 --> 01:26:38,158
Son of a bitch!

714
01:26:38,192 --> 01:26:39,782
What happened?

715
01:26:39,858 --> 01:26:44,768
Our men are being beaten. We must get them out of there.

716
01:27:01,018 --> 01:27:02,528
Quiet. Men!

717
01:27:02,618 --> 01:27:06,608
The two of us and other ten men go to the gate.

718
01:27:06,698 --> 01:27:09,818
Select them! Tie those whom you do not trust!

719
01:27:09,938 --> 01:27:14,168
I suggest to tie the corporal and both lance corporals.

720
01:27:14,258 --> 01:27:18,888
No! If they betray us we shall kill them.

721
01:27:19,418 --> 01:27:21,218
You will not.

722
01:27:21,298 --> 01:27:24,418
All right. Join us to the gate.

723
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:26,018
We do.

724
01:28:02,698 --> 01:28:05,168
We go to the gate together.

725
01:28:05,258 --> 01:28:09,168
If we go together we shall be killed

726
01:28:09,258 --> 01:28:11,248
by the machine guns in the middle of the yard.

727
01:28:11,338 --> 01:28:15,888
The guns cannot shoot! Tono removed the pins.

728
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:19,568
Come here!

729
01:28:21,498 --> 01:28:24,328
Fine. Four rifles more.

730
01:28:24,418 --> 01:28:25,928
When they enter, stand behind their backs.

731
01:28:26,018 --> 01:28:28,088
But carefully! If a shot is heard, we are lost.

732
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:30,608
To the door!

733
01:28:48,818 --> 01:28:51,248
Attention!

734
01:29:00,618 --> 01:29:03,418
Why are you fighting. Bastard?

735
01:29:14,298 --> 01:29:17,568
Where did you serve in the Italian front?

736
01:29:18,258 --> 01:29:20,608
With dogs.

737
01:29:20,978 --> 01:29:22,968
What dogs?

738
01:29:23,938 --> 01:29:28,888
Pulling sledges with gun machines.

739
01:29:30,738 --> 01:29:32,888
Captain, please...

740
01:29:35,258 --> 01:29:37,848
I think something is going on.

741
01:29:37,938 --> 01:29:41,328
- Where? - The old company.

742
01:30:06,298 --> 01:30:09,928
- What's going on? - They are being led away!

743
01:30:10,018 --> 01:30:13,288
Hold out, tinkers!

744
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:37,658
Men. The rifles!

745
01:31:23,338 --> 01:31:25,448
Alarm!

746
01:31:29,178 --> 01:31:30,898
Damn it!

747
01:31:48,738 --> 01:31:50,688
Open!

748
01:32:17,578 --> 01:32:19,648
The machine guns!

749
01:32:19,738 --> 01:32:21,688
Fire!

750
01:33:06,818 --> 01:33:12,448
Where shall we question the captain?

751
01:33:12,938 --> 01:33:15,738
Here. Or in the yard?

752
01:33:16,218 --> 01:33:19,968
By all means. Here.

753
01:33:47,618 --> 01:33:49,928
Jesus Christ!

754
01:34:01,098 --> 01:34:06,778
Call the dragoons, they hate the infantry.

755
01:34:06,858 --> 01:34:11,368
The rebels have cut off telephone in the whole town.

756
01:34:11,458 --> 01:34:13,338
They are not stupid.

757
01:34:13,418 --> 01:34:17,408
Unlike their commanders.

758
01:34:18,018 --> 01:34:22,608
Post a battery of artillery to the front

759
01:34:22,698 --> 01:34:26,488
and the Bosniaks to the side.

760
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:30,328
Not to make waves in the town. We let the rebels go out.

761
01:34:30,418 --> 01:34:33,538
I prefer an open struggle in the field.

762
01:34:33,938 --> 01:34:36,448
Oh my God, what is going on?

763
01:34:36,538 --> 01:34:42,088
Nothing, madam, go on dancing!

764
01:34:53,018 --> 01:34:57,528
We are strong because we stick together!

765
01:34:57,618 --> 01:35:00,608
We want to finish this war!

766
01:35:00,698 --> 01:35:04,048
We want peace like in Russia!

767
01:35:06,658 --> 01:35:12,178
Who starves in this war? The poor! Our women and children!

768
01:35:12,258 --> 01:35:16,138
Counts. Barons and manufacturers are not afraid of the war.

769
01:35:16,218 --> 01:35:18,248
That is the fact our fathers had already known!

770
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:21,808
Who knows who we fight for?

771
01:35:21,898 --> 01:35:24,888
For the rich people!

772
01:35:25,138 --> 01:35:26,698
That's it, for the rich!

773
01:35:26,778 --> 01:35:29,168
From now on, we shall do so for ourselves!

774
01:35:29,258 --> 01:35:30,848
We shall gain different orders!

775
01:35:30,938 --> 01:35:35,168
- How can we? We are few! - There are many of us!

776
01:35:35,818 --> 01:35:38,328
We get in touch with our men at Grosnica.

777
01:35:38,418 --> 01:35:40,728
And with the Serbians in the mountains.

778
01:35:40,818 --> 01:35:42,888
The others will follow us.

779
01:35:42,978 --> 01:35:46,858
But we must maintain order!

780
01:35:46,938 --> 01:35:49,008
They shall not defeat us!

781
01:35:49,098 --> 01:35:53,458
I think corporal Matej Frujak should lead us!

782
01:36:04,058 --> 01:36:06,288
Nobody and nothing.

783
01:36:07,138 --> 01:36:10,288
Where are those bloody bastards?

784
01:36:10,658 --> 01:36:14,168
I would like to say goodbye to the major.

785
01:36:19,778 --> 01:36:25,218
The major is mine. Such was my promise.

786
01:36:26,498 --> 01:36:31,048
If I am not able to revenge. There are my related by blood.

787
01:36:32,538 --> 01:36:34,608
That is our custom.

788
01:36:35,498 --> 01:36:39,808
The murderer shall die by our hands.

789
01:36:42,578 --> 01:36:45,328
Come.

790
01:36:51,738 --> 01:36:56,528
Stipa. Come back to me!

791
01:36:56,738 --> 01:37:00,008
Stipa, come back!

792
01:37:43,498 --> 01:37:45,608
The liaisons from Grosnica have not come back yet.

793
01:37:45,698 --> 01:37:47,808
I am afraid dragoons may have pounced upon them.

794
01:37:47,898 --> 01:37:49,248
We must find out if we can expect some help.

795
01:37:49,338 --> 01:37:51,928
- I am going there. - Don't hurry.

796
01:37:52,338 --> 01:37:54,608
The roads are probably occupied.

797
01:37:54,698 --> 01:37:56,288
You must cross the field.

798
01:37:56,378 --> 01:37:58,018
There is a shorter way, along the brook.

799
01:37:58,098 --> 01:38:00,488
- Do you know it? - I used to go there.

800
01:38:00,578 --> 01:38:01,898
- Come. Stevko. - I am going too.

801
01:38:01,978 --> 01:38:05,288
Go! I will stop the company near Grosnica!

802
01:38:27,218 --> 01:38:30,178
Who shall we shoot at?

803
01:38:31,258 --> 01:38:33,328
Everything is rubbish.

804
01:39:28,738 --> 01:39:32,128
- Stop! The password! - Tinkers.

805
01:39:32,218 --> 01:39:33,858
- Come in. - Have our men come?

806
01:39:33,938 --> 01:39:37,448
They have. We are ready now.

807
01:41:00,498 --> 01:41:03,218
Kolibec Viktor!

808
01:41:08,938 --> 01:41:11,608
Closer!

809
01:41:36,178 --> 01:41:38,528
- Dubnicky Ondrej! - Dead.

810
01:41:41,378 --> 01:41:43,448
- Valovic Martin! - Missing.

811
01:41:43,538 --> 01:41:46,688
- Gajdos Juraj! - Dead.

812
01:41:51,578 --> 01:41:57,128
The first. The second - the third. Step forward!

813
01:42:47,138 --> 01:42:51,528
Forty-three... forty-four.

814
01:42:52,618 --> 01:42:55,528
Forty-four.

815
01:42:58,938 --> 01:43:03,298
Take off your caps and shirts!

816
01:43:22,698 --> 01:43:27,328
Julka, I wrote you I would come back

817
01:43:27,418 --> 01:43:30,968
even from the very end of the earth.

818
01:43:32,138 --> 01:43:37,498
I look forward to how our girl will be friends with me.

819
01:43:38,258 --> 01:43:40,288
She will not.

820
01:43:41,058 --> 01:43:44,258
She will never know her father.

821
01:43:44,698 --> 01:43:48,608
I wish she never experienced such violence.

822
01:43:48,698 --> 01:43:52,528
I wish she never experienced a war!

823
01:43:53,178 --> 01:43:56,328
I promised Marica to come back.

824
01:43:57,298 --> 01:44:00,018
You did a good thing.

825
01:44:00,098 --> 01:44:05,328
She probably doesn't know what happened. That's better.

826
01:44:06,338 --> 01:44:08,848
Better, Stevko.

827
01:44:12,858 --> 01:44:14,608
She has come.

828
01:44:16,258 --> 01:44:20,728
Stipa. Darling!

829
01:44:30,938 --> 01:44:33,248
She has come.

830
01:44:34,498 --> 01:44:38,168
We wanted to go to my parents' house after the war.

831
01:44:38,258 --> 01:44:40,608
You will be well off there.

832
01:44:40,698 --> 01:44:43,288
We all will be well off.

833
01:44:43,378 --> 01:44:46,848
There will be no more wars after this war.

834
01:44:46,938 --> 01:44:49,688
People will become wise.

835
01:44:49,778 --> 01:44:52,418
They will find a human speech.

836
01:44:52,498 --> 01:44:57,408
Man will say to man:

837
01:44:58,098 --> 01:45:00,448
What is the use of wars?

838
01:45:00,538 --> 01:45:02,808
What is the use of killing one another?

839
01:45:04,858 --> 01:45:07,578
THE END
