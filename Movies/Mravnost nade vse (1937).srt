Directed by

13
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,277
The film was made in 1937

14
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,477
Fantasy is a monster that has
devoured much of me.

15
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,395
Wrote Henrik Ibsen at the age
ofsixty to an eighteen year old girl.

16
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,310
I believe this needs no comment.

17
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,070
Fantasy is human evil, which we must
reckon with,

18
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,237
which, however,
we must not give up fighting.

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,318
In short, fantasy should be
limited to its very essence,

20
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,349
othen/vise, it leads to Iechery,
immorality, and crime.

21
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,714
Or one starts writing poems
and that is sometimes as bad.

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,873
I shall end with my usual words:

23
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,596
Morality above all else.
Thank you.

24
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,312
Who is wearing that strong perfume?
It is you, isn't it?

25
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,716
A pleasant scent, isn't it?
- Why are you wearing perfume, eh?

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,628
There's nothing bad about it.
- Perfume is an immoral invention.

27
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,151
It incites fantasy and has a hidden
intent. Do you understand? - Yes.

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,238
Very well.
Morality above all else.

29
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,795
Couldn't it wait after I leave?

30
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,434
Tell me, why do you wear make-up?
- She wants to please our eyes.

31
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,396
Morality above all else.

32
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,758
Good day.

33
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,758
Who was that?
- Professor Karas.

34
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,236
What a true gentleman!

35
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,870
A paragon of virtue and morality.

36
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,920
How did it happen to him?

37
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,672
Good day.

38
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,072
What's up?

39
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,032
What's the matter?

40
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,953
I found this at lvan's desk.

41
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,357
I was studying history.

42
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,519
And this is what interests you
the most from history, eh!

43
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,393
Very well.
We shall discuss it later.

44
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,393
And I found this in Eve's room.

45
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,270
My idol, I cannot sleep,
as I keepthinking about you.

46
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,150
I would like to walk with you
hand in hand through life,

47
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,392
though, unfortunately,
neither can I or you.

48
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,120
To whom did you write this?
- No one.

49
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,757
Don't lie.
You had to write it to someone.

50
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,031
I was just fancying
what it would be like,

51
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,709
if I were passionately in love
with someone.

52
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,953
Fancying, I see.
It's that fantasy again.

53
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,675
Does mother have fantasy?
Or do I have any

54
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,790
<i>I'll</i> get that fantasy of yours
from your heads!

55
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,277
You'll get an austere governess!
She'll keep your fantasy on a leash.

56
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,271
And as to you!
<i>I'll</i> take care ofyou myself.

57
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,672
I beg your pardon, sir, there are
ladies waiting foryou in the hall.

58
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,552
I'm coming.

59
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,909
The committee ofthe Society for the
Elevation of Morality.

60
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,676
My dear ladies.
What a pleasant surprise!

61
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,235
To what do I owe such an honour?

62
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,591
Dearest professor!

63
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,679
But ladies! The committee decided
that I am to speak.

64
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,520
Dearest professor

65
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,277
She's always moved to tears.

66
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,110
Dearest professor
- We are coming to you with a mission.

67
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,239
The committee of our society
took the liberty

68
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,670
Took the liberty, dearest professor

69
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,992
To name you foryour merits
in the field of morality

70
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,477
as the honorary chairman
ofour society.

71
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,071
My dear ladies, I am truly moved.

72
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,158
I do not know how I could desenle
such an honour.

73
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,431
I indeed accept.

74
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,997
On 16th ofthis month
a ceremony will be held in our hall

75
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,192
at the occasion of the revelation
of your bust,

76
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,279
which we shall order
- At our expense.

77
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,960
There you are, master.
- Thank you.

78
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,190
It is nice.

79
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,754
What do you think?
- Very nice.

80
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,793
You did a magnificentjob, master.
- And as soon as it resembles him,

81
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,957
everyone will recognize him.
- There will be his name on the bust,

82
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,632
so there won't be any trouble.
- Don't forget the motto, master.

83
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,956
Morality Above All Else.

84
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,399
Don't let it distract you, <i>I'll</i>
pick it up - Be so kind, please.

85
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,274
Master Konrad's atelier.
- This is Doctor Mach speaking.

86
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,516
Is Professor Karas there, miss?

87
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,393
Good day, sir, this is Eva Karasova.

88
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,192
Can I give a message to my father?

89
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,470
Eve, tell your father to come
to the phone.

90
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,672
He can't because ofthe bust.
- He got busted?

91
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,351
He's sitting for his bust.
Yes, <i>I'll</i> tell him, just a moment.

92
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,353
Father, you are to go to the phone.
Doctor Mach wants to speak with you.

93
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,472
Ask him what he wants.
- He wants to talk to you.

94
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,079
He's saying it's urgent.

95
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,875
Tell him to say what he wants.
I have nothing to hide.

96
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,120
Mrs. Karas, your husband is a true
paragon of virtue.

97
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,755
You should be proud of him.
- I am.

98
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,952
Father, Iamto tellyou
- What's this? Why are you whispering!

99
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,277
Speak aloud.
Isaid I had nothing to hide.

100
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,075
I am to say one word.
And you'll know what it means.

101
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,556
What word?
- Duckling.

102
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,638
What's this supposed to mean?

103
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,718
What kind of a sillyjoke is this?
- Ajoke? Here's the telegram.

104
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,755
I am coming on Wednesday with the
Paris Express, tell father. Duckling.

105
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,670
That's terrible.
- Why? You like her, don't you?

106
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,351
I do. But understand me in this
situation! It's a disaster.

107
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,393
You see what I told you?
You should have confessed long ago.

108
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,876
You've been promising that child for
years that you'd take her home.

109
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,949
You don't have the guts to tell your
wife what will come to light anyway.

110
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,308
Such a secret can't be kept forever.
Vera can't do with a mere picture

111
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,513
of you that you send her each year.
- Stop this reproach.

112
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,350
Call her that she can't come under
these circumstances.

113
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,553
Why under these circumstances?
- Imagine a honorary chairman ofthe

114
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,832
Society for the Elevation of Morality
having a child born out of wedlock.

115
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,030
Why did that duckling make you
so furious?

116
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,280
It was Mach, you see? He always
has such childish ideas.

117
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,312
He really gets on my nenles.
- I don't seem to understand.

118
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,309
Such an innocent word.
- Let me explain.

119
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,278
Ivan, Eve, leave the room!
You don't have to hear everything.

120
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,551
Hurry up!
Nothing escapes your ears, eh!

121
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,596
To the duckling. When I was a child,
we went to school together.

122
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,634
I had a flat nose

123
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,715
end blue eyes,
so they used to call me Duckling.

124
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,078
And it still makes you angry? I don't
understand. - Neither do I.

125
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,911
Hullo? Professor Karas speaking.
- Hi dad, it's me, Duckling.

126
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,117
I've just arrived.
You're happy, aren't you?

127
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,637
I see, look in the left drawer.

128
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,313
But it's me, dad!

129
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,399
It must be there somewhere.
Try to remember, where you put it.

130
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,998
Who are you talking to, dad?
It's me Vera, your Duckling.

131
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,953
I'm staying at the Bristol, room 112.
Come over.

132
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,552
That's impossible, Duck...
You see, it keeps haunting me.

133
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,038
Hullo! What?
You must find the draft.

134
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,311
Wait, <i>I'll</i> be right there.

135
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,309
They lost the draft of my lecture.
I must go back. I'm sorry.

136
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,510
A beautiful city.
I didn't imagine it like this at all.

137
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,392
Miss is here for the first time?

138
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,479
For the first and for the last I hope.
- You don't want to return?

139
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,750
On the contrary.
I've decided to stay here.

140
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,235
I see. Is there anything else
you need, miss?

141
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,920
No, thank you. <i>I'll</i> ring the bell.
- Yes, miss.

142
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,833
Well.
Pardon me.

143
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,240
Tony!
- Let me go! I forbid

144
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,956
This is not possible.

145
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,229
Come here.
Come here.

146
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,993
My Duckling.
What a miracle. Let me see you.

147
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,720
I can't even speak.

148
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,236
You look so much like your mother.

149
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,997
You rascal! You're so alike her
deliberately to move me to tears.

150
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,910
Ifyour mother didn't die then,

151
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,395
Iwould have married her.

152
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,270
The tub will flow over.

153
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,038
You're staying here, Tony?
- Don't call me Tony.

154
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,833
I can't call you daddy and you've
always signed your letters as Tony,

155
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,111
not to disclose yourself.
And all of a sudden you don't like it.

156
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,310
And all of a sudden you think
you can be cheeky

157
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,795
just because you've moved me
to tears?

158
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,275
You can't call me Tony.
I'm a reputable person here.

159
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,755
And no Tony!

160
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,476
Listen, you don't need to wear
so much perfume.

161
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,149
Why not? - Why not?
Perfume is an immoral invention.

162
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,956
Why did you come anyway? You're
getting me into a terrible situation.

163
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,072
You've been promising to tell your
wife about me for years.

164
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,395
That I could stay with you
like other children.

165
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,275
It's quite complicated, my dear.
I don't know how to explain.

166
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,757
You know that after the war I married
into a wealthy and honourable family.

167
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,395
I couldn't even think of confessing
that I have you then.

168
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,672
I promised Iwould re-educate my wife
and instead

169
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,511
She re-educated me. I'm up to my
ears in it. I got so tainted

170
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,470
with that false morale that I proclaim
morality to be above all else.

171
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,750
You do not!
- I certainly do.

172
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,348
They appointed me to all sorts
of positions.

173
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,913
They'll also reveal my bust.
- A bust? That will be fun.

174
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,919
I must see it myself.
- No! You must leave at once.

175
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,589
Don't drive me out, your wife
and children can't think

176
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,314
that you came into the family as a
- Now then!

177
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,192
Morality above all else.

178
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,632
You're doomed, dad.
- Be sensible, my dear.

179
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,110
Doctor Mach will see to everything,
you'll go to the mountains,

180
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,869
it's very nice there. <i>I'll</i> arrange
my matters and join you in few days.

181
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,549
But, daddy.
- Don't make it worse.

182
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,116
Do I have any other choice?
- Splendid. I knew you were my girl.

183
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,519
My dear girl. What is this?
What are you doing! Stop it!

184
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,469
I won't say farewell.

185
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,797
As we'll be seeing each other soon.
Write a letter <i>to</i> Doctor Mach

186
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,074
afteryou get there so that I know
where to find you. Good bye.

187
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,950
Now I'm wearing perfume!

188
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,240
What a swell daddy I have!

189
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,078
One can't choose one's parents!

190
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,752
Detective stories.

191
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,316
Good day.

192
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,194
You're studying, that's fine.
What are you studying?

193
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,276
Czech, very well.

194
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,356
Logarithms, splendid.

195
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,949
Children, remind me tomorrow
that I have to sit for the bust.

196
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,832
Good day.
- Good day.

197
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,198
Who is wearing that strong perfume?

198
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,469
I'd like to know myself
who is wearing that

199
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,475
Come here, Eve!

200
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,392
Ivan!

201
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,635
Madla! Come here!

202
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,271
It's high time.
I'm going to my room.

203
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,232
Good day.

204
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,473
<i>Good day.
What can</i> I <i>do foryou?</i>

205
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,473
Is father here?
- No.

206
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,435
It's so nice.

207
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,075
You're still here?
- Yes.

208
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,716
I'm leaving.
- Good bye.

209
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,120
I'm leaving.

210
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,510
I'm really leaving.

211
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,828
Yes, madam, at eight o'clock.

212
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,714
I won't keep dinner waiting for me.

213
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,352
It's good that you reminded me
of the governess.

214
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,550
I'll call the English college
straight away.

215
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,240
Good day, madam.

216
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,270
Do you know who it was?
- No.

217
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,038
Your father's wife.

218
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,549
Really? And you're going over there
for dinner tonight?

219
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,070
I envy you.
What did you say about the governess?

220
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,156
They need a governess for their
daughter.

221
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,236
You've never seen such a muff.

222
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,113
Perhaps you could go

223
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,473
What are you laughing at?
- Nothing. Just a silly idea.

224
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,115
Miss Gregorova?

225
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,834
Vera Gregorova, room 112.

226
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,590
She checked out and left.
- Are you sure? - Yes.

227
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,759
You're a fine chap.
Thank you. You've made my day.

228
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,871
Have you got change?
Never mind, keep it. Thank you.

229
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,353
You must add one more plate
for the governess.

230
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,153
Go upstairs and ask her, whether
she needs anything. - Yes, ma'am.

231
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,669
I like her, mummy.

232
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,712
I like her too.
She has English manners.

233
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,389
You must be nice and kind to her.
And obey.

234
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,757
And I don't want to hear
any complaints about you, Ivan.

235
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,633
There's no need to worry, mummy,
I won't take notice of her.

236
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,673
<i>You poor boy, you'd be glad
if she took notice of you.</i>

237
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,791
Quiet, children, father is coming!

238
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,759
Good evening.
Well, what's new?

239
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,316
I've hired a new governess for Eve.
- Very well.

240
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,113
Is she decent?
- I think you will like her much.

241
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,630
She's not very pretty, but she has
distinguished manners and she's modest.

242
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,389
That's alright. Is she here?
- In the guest room.

243
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,515
Why such a beaming smile, dear?
- Never mind. Something turned out well.

244
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,189
Mr. Mach is coming over to dinner.
- What? Doctor Mach?

245
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,676
He'll be telling his ambiguous jokes
all evening and I truly dislike that.

246
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,273
What's this supposed to mean?
What ill manners

247
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,073
Ah, the governess.

248
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,158
Come downstairs, please.
<i>l'll</i> introduce you to my husband.

249
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,311
Missis
- Gregor, how do you do?

250
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,553
Excuse me, I feel rather unwell.

251
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,116
What happended to the professor?
- I have no idea.

252
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,115
What are you doing, dear!

253
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,238
Good evening, madam.
- Good evening. Thank you.

254
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,998
What's the matter?
- Anthony. -What?

255
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,712
Anthony?

256
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,993
What's the matter with you?

257
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,192
What's wrong?

258
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,677
Nothing. I was introduced
to the new governess.

259
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,438
But I feel better now.

260
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,120
What are you talking about?
Let me see.

261
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,156
It doesn't look good.
<i>I'll</i> send over my physician.

262
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,070
Good morning, Doctor Jilovsky.

263
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,555
Come in, doctor.

264
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,512
It was a terrible night, sir.

265
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,117
He kept waving his hands and yelling
that morality is above all else.

266
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,390
You see, madam, that's the point.

267
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,034
The professor should not overdo it
with morality.

268
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,878
Besides, it's nothing serious.

269
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,514
He can get up, he can work.
It will do him only good.

270
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,471
<i>I'll</i> call on him once more
just to make sure he's fine.

271
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,558
Good bye, doctor.
- Farewell, madam.

272
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,318
I beg your pardon.

273
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,756
Excuse me.

274
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,198
My name is Doctor Jilovsky.
- Karas Junior. - I see.

275
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,155
Tell me, who is that pretty blond?

276
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,636
A pretty blond here? Impossible.
- I've seen her upstairs a moment ago.

277
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,149
I have no idea at all.
- Who is living in the house?

278
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,670
Me, father, mother, sister.
- Is she pretty?

279
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,756
That depends.

280
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,633
And her governess.
- She must be pretty then.

281
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,911
I wouldn't say so.
- I really don't understand.

282
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,834
What did I forget.
Oh yes. My watch. Thank you.

283
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,108
Pardon me.
- Are you a doctor? - I am.

284
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,674
Tell me, how is father?

285
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,552
The father of the boy?
- He's much better.

286
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,319
Is it serious?
- No, not at all.

287
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,556
I'm ready.

288
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,636
I'm coming.

289
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,315
Who is it?

290
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,192
The professor's daughter.

291
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,470
The boy was right.
- Pardon? - Never mind.

292
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,875
How is the professor anyway?

293
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,718
You know what, miss?
- Yes?

294
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,798
<i>L'll</i> spare some time foryou one day.
Good bye.

295
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,672
I've got you.
You must leave immediately.

296
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,279
But, daddy.

297
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,915
I'm glad I can live with you.
- This is an impossible situation.

298
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,996
Look, Tony, don't be so

299
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,991
Well, professor.
- Don't call me Tony or professor.

300
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,908
But, professor.
<i>- l'll</i> dust you behind, I swear.

301
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,590
Youth must be treated with utmost
caution.

302
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,032
As it leaves strong impressions
on the human soul.

303
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:02,598
Be very strict with my daughter.
You may leave.

304
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,954
I've got out ofthat quite well.
- What?

305
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,358
What? Never mind.
- You shouldn't be so strict on her.

306
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,277
Do you think so?
Hullo!

307
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,632
You may go.

308
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,072
What do you say to her?
She's made the best impression on me.

309
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,350
She did? I'm most pleased.

310
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,474
That you're satisfied with her.
Yet, I don't find her much appealing.

311
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,512
Iwould dismiss her.
- Why?

312
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:33,720
We'll have a different English lesson.
I've got my own methods.

313
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,599
We'll have a different English lesson.
I've got my own methods.

314
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,355
Well, the most important word
for a woman is sex appeal.

315
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,118
What does it mean?

316
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,710
Of course, you don't know it.
Sex appeal is the woman's charm.

317
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,796
What good is it?

318
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,480
Listen, do you believe in storks
carrying babies?

319
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,440
Oh my.
- It'll be tough work with you.

320
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,874
Tell me, why are you standing
like that?

321
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,353
How should I stand?

322
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,677
You're standing like this.
While you should stand like this.

323
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,157
And you walk like this.
While you should walk like this.

324
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,359
As if dancing.
Why are you so sheepish?

325
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,233
Iam not.
- Put a bit of life into it!

326
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,634
It's fun.

327
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,069
You mustn't be so buttoned-up.
Be yourself.

328
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,556
If something crosses your mind,
don't be ashamed and do it.

329
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,948
<i>Look!</i>

330
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,279
Try it yourself.

331
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,755
I can't do it like that.

332
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,596
Kneel.

333
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,756
Put your head to your knees.

334
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,832
Ouch.

335
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,196
Do I have sex appeal now?

336
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,880
It's much better.
Once more.

337
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,950
One, two, three!

338
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,550
Good Lord!

339
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,310
Continue.
With ease and confidence.

340
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,796
Hop, hop, and hop!
It's your turn.

341
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,318
Hop, hop. Watch out!

342
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,109
And hop.

343
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,798
Give me that chair, quick!

344
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,071
Don't be afraid! Higher.
- Higher!

345
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,598
And our next lesson will be French.

346
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,196
Stop it, I beg you.

347
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,756
It's no laughing matter.
I see horrible things.

348
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,919
You must help me get rid of the girl,
or it will result in a disaster.

349
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,759
I've been living in constant fear
for a week in my own house!

350
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,316
I, who was always so morally
confident,

351
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,874
I'm afraid now to look
to face of my own wife.

352
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,468
Inclusive of my children.

353
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,957
That's what you get for not
admitting such an adorable child.

354
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,829
She is adorable, that's quite true.

355
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,553
Alright, I shall acknowledge her
as mine, ifthere's no other option.

356
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,037
But only after the bust is revealed.
I can't do it now.

357
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,319
I keep running from the house, just
to find peace for a moment.

358
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,239
One can truly repose here.
It's so quiet.

359
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,599
Good day.
We came to raise your spirits.

360
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,515
That's so attentive of you.

361
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,717
It proceeds splendidly.
It will be soon finished, won't it?

362
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,071
It is so beautiful.

363
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,352
You've captured the professor
remarkably, master.

364
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,917
You're so fortunate, Miss Eve,
to have such a fine father.

365
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,998
You must be proud of him.
Am I right?

366
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,155
That moral balance.

367
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,273
That honest look in his eyes.

368
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,793
That clear conscience.

369
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:38,437
As a rule, twinges of conscience
appear in the last resort.

370
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,034
One begins to regret
one's wrongdoing

371
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,033
either immediately before it is
disclosed,

372
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,199
or aflen/wards.

373
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,557
Thereby, I do not mean criminals,
who accept punishment as a risk,

374
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,800
but a normal decent man,
who had committed something

375
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,879
in his youth and suddenly
it all begins to

376
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,398
I shall end with my usual words:

377
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,478
Morality above all else.

378
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,912
Farewell.

379
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,389
Good day, professor,
could I have a few words with you?

380
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,510
I don't want to backbite,
yet I must inform you,

381
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,596
as our chairman.

382
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,840
Mrs. Nyklasova will surely try
to ingratiate herselfwith you.

383
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,791
She is like that.

384
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,436
She pretends to be a saint, while
she's chasing men like the Devil!

385
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,314
I've rented a summer house
with her once, so I know her.

386
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,077
She doesn't wear that long skin
out of morality.

387
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,034
If you'd only see her legs, sir.

388
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,315
Thank you for warning me.

389
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,953
Good day, professor,
I'm so glad to see you.

390
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,797
I don't want to backbite,
but Mrs. Roubalova,

391
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,469
she's actually a miss.

392
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,558
She doesn't do anything
from dawn till dusk

393
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,275
than calling on everyone and
scandalmongering. It's like a race.

394
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,358
While it's the last thing
she should be doing. She

395
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,757
You don't say!
Brought up by foster parents?

396
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,717
Some people, eh?
- Indeed.

397
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,798
Excuse me, I must be off.
Good day. - Good day.

398
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,398
What a coincidence, professor.

399
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,876
But since we've met,
I must tell you something.

400
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,391
I don't want to backbite,
but Mrs. Drazna, our secretary,

401
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,195
the one that is always moved
to tears.

402
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,950
It's not out of her emotions.
She drinks pure rum. - Rum?

403
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,833
Just ask her to breathe on you.

404
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,832
Thank you.

405
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,074
Ah, the secretary.
What can I do foryou?

406
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,512
Professor, I don't want to backbite,
but

407
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,359
Jamaican.

408
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,078
My Dearest, Since I have been
watching you mould my father,

409
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,951
I feel our souls could understand
each other.

410
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,838
What is it?

411
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,110
Nothing.
- Give it to me.

412
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,952
What's this supposed to mean?

413
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,230
Nothing at all.

414
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,915
Let's be sincere. Confide in me,
as if I were your sister.

415
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,236
My sister?

416
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,429
Hullo, Doctor Mach?
It's me, Karas. It's out.

417
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,438
She told herjust now.
What? <i>I'll</i> be right over.

418
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,555
Does he know that you love him?

419
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,349
He hasn't even noticed me yet.
- I'm not surprised.

420
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,198
Wait, what could work on him?

421
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,630
Take off your glasses.

422
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,396
You know you have quite nice eyes?

423
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,988
I do?
- Why do you wear glasses?

424
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,510
I can't read very well without them.
- Why do you wear them all the time?

425
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,598
In our family, we all wear glasses.
- So you won't be wearing them.

426
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,678
I'd get catch, if I didn't.
- Quiet.

427
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,952
It would be terribly bad luck, if
that gentleman didn't take the bait.

428
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,356
Smile.
You see, that's much better.

429
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,550
Why do you wear your hair combed
behind your ears?

430
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,355
Mummy says that a girl should not
attract too much attention.

431
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,199
Othen/vise, men tend
to become impertinent.

432
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,676
On the other hand though, one does
lack too little attention.

433
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,552
Let me see.

434
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,959
A bit of fantasy.
You're quite a pretty girl.

435
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,232
Take these clodhoppers off.

436
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,556
Take these shoes.

437
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,952
Here's a dress.

438
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,238
And here's a bit of female charm.

439
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,354
I'm curious what the girls are doing.
So I am eavesdropping.

440
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:13,032
And I clearly hear my daughter,
the legitimate one,

441
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,392
say to the other, the illegitimate one:
My sister?

442
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,875
It's quite clear, isn't it?

443
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,709
Nothing can make me go home.
- Don't be so furious.

444
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,070
You're out ofyour minds!
What's this supposed to mean!

445
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,476
Madam, your daughter,
as she should look like.

446
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,389
I can't get over the shock.

447
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,875
This can't be happening.

448
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,789
And you are a governess!
- I've got my methods.

449
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,277
Fine methods, Isay! Eve!
Go to your room and get changed!

450
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,238
And you too.
Father will be home any minute.

451
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,954
If he saw what bad influence
you have on her!

452
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,991
Let me explain, madam.

453
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,759
There's no need!
- She is young and wants to look nice.

454
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,632
I'm telling you no, no and no!

455
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,398
No, I'm not going home!

456
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,956
What will you do?
- What will I do?

457
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,231
I don't know yet. But I'm not going
home. Definitely not now!

458
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,109
Good Lord, that girl is giving me
hell. I see horrible things.

459
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,992
Look at what has become of me.

460
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,953
MY family, my dignity and honesty,
even/thing is gone!

461
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,153
Only that bust will remain
as a monument ofshame and hypocrisy.

462
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,512
Pull yourself together and go home.
They don't know what happened to you.

463
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,153
I'm not going home.

464
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,636
Don't ask such things.

465
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,149
There's nothing to it, madam.

466
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,352
Stop it, don't embarrass me.

467
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,789
Why don't you want to tell me?

468
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,878
Very well, if you want to know.

469
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,514
The last time he kissed me
was on my birthday.

470
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,628
That was last year on March 15.

471
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,320
That's almost nine months ago.
It's pretty long ago.

472
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,318
Tell me, did you never want to
please his eyes?

473
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,989
I beg your pardon!
My husband likes me as I am.

474
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,314
And that's enough for me.

475
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,273
Don't you think he could like you
even more?

476
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,960
Such silly questions!

477
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,277
Besides, it's understandable with
young girls as you or Eve.

478
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,676
But me?
- Forgive me, madam.

479
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,759
Did he ever bring you flowers?
- Yes, before we were married.

480
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,678
And wouldn't it make you happy,
if he brought you flowers every day?

481
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,157
Every woman must be pleased. If she's
good looking and has sex appeal.

482
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,320
Don't be indecent, miss!

483
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,356
Well, I'm here.
- So what?

484
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,040
I came to see, if father is here.

485
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,310
He's not.

486
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,791
But I'm here.

487
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,150
So what?
- I'm here, look.

488
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,872
Well look at you! Is this possible?
Is it really you?

489
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,312
Let's have a look.

490
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,399
<i>You look</i> very <i>nice!
- Look, I've got sex appeal.</i>

491
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,512
He took the bait!

492
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,516
I'm here.

493
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,636
I must go now.

494
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,480
Excuse me, Iforgot my watch here
some time ago.

495
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,675
Excuse me, Iforgot my watch here
some time ago.

496
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,677
Here, sir?
- In the professor's room.

497
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,553
Just a moment.
<i>I'll</i> ask the madam.

498
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,276
Good day, miss. How is the professor?
- He's well.

499
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,960
Miss! - Yes?
What was it that I wanted to say?

500
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,036
Nothing, perhaps.
- Tell me,

501
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,675
what do the covered statues mean?
- That it's a moral and honest family.

502
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,358
Why don't they put them in the attic?

503
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,630
One wouldn't see that they are
so honest.

504
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,036
Miss, I'd like to ask you something.

505
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,872
You know what, sir?
- Yes?

506
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,958
<i>L'll</i> spare some time foryou one day.

507
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,755
Miss, could you spare three seconds,
please?

508
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,996
No.
- Just three seconds.

509
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,873
One, two, three!

510
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,029
Quite thick glasses, eh?
At least six dioptres.

511
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,116
It is you!

512
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,870
Just for a moment, please!

513
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,753
You must help me.
Sit down.

514
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,676
Pull yourself together.
Give me the key.

515
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,191
I don't have it. - The key?
Yes. <i>- l'll</i> ring the bell.

516
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,677
There's nothing to be done now,
when everything has come to light.

517
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,110
I'm with you, don't be afraid.
- I see horrible things.

518
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,798
I've heard that before.

519
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,070
Good day.
- Good day.

520
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,272
Come on.
Come here. Stand here.

521
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,148
What's happening here anyway?
- Nothing, sir.

522
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,397
Has my wife calmed down?
- I don't know about anything, sir.

523
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,351
You see!
- Did she say something?

524
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,233
Nothing at all.
- Very well, let's go in.

525
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,199
She said nothing. That's even worse.
- Come in.

526
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:59,835
How could that happen, doctor?

527
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,396
Such illness comes suddenly, madam.

528
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,272
It's the weather. It's in the air.

529
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,154
Is it serious?
- It isn't. Don't worry.

530
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,632
He'll stay in bed for a few days.
- How dreadful!

531
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,276
How dreadful!

532
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,431
You'll give me twenty crowns.
- Lie down!

533
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,393
You'll give me twenty crowns
for each day in bed.

534
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,080
Alright, just stay in bed!
What if someone comes here?

535
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,316
It's so dreadful!

536
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,193
Here we go!

537
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,234
On the top ofthat you were away
all day.

538
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,477
Don't be surprised, madam.
- I know he has plenty of work to do.

539
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,511
But he could call at least.

540
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,599
It is hard to say such things
over the phone.

541
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,910
Believe me, I'm heartbroken.

542
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,998
I understand.
It is your child, after all.

543
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,193
You are so wise.

544
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,995
So prudent.
- We mustn't lose our head.

545
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,951
Believe me, I'm so unhappy
to cause you so much trouble

546
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,196
with the child.

547
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,154
Why are you apologising?
It's my child as well.

548
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,832
What?

549
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,589
It's rather hot, isn't it?

550
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,075
The doctor is with him.

551
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,759
With whom?

552
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,633
With Ivan, of course.

553
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,917
What is so amusing, sir?

554
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,918
I beg your pardon, madam,
it's my illness.

555
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,150
You're such an addle head!
- I see that myself.

556
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,238
What is this?

557
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,956
Come here!

558
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,873
What are you wearing?
Let me see!

559
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,240
What's all this?
Who did this to you?

560
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,834
She looks nice, doesn't she?

561
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,630
What pretty girls I have, eh?

562
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,391
I won't stand this!

563
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,909
You won't be wearing this!
And you as well!

564
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,998
Let them be. They're young and
they want to look nice.

565
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,669
Well

566
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,597
Wednesday. I can't come round.
He kissed me for the first time

567
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,553
four days ago. It was breathtaking.
I felt dizzy.

568
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:18,514
And I'm feeling dizzy even now.

569
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,670
S/rup three times a day.
- I won't swallow that.

570
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,270
Prescribe me some raspberryjuice,
or <i>I'll</i> recover at once.

571
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,359
Besides, I'm getting bored. I've been
in bed for 4 days. I've had enough.

572
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,755
No, I need you to be sick.

573
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,633
In that case, you'll give me thirty
crowns for each call. Alright?

574
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,716
Alright.

575
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,480
Dearest wife,

576
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,838
Dear Caroline,

577
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,393
I can't go on like this.

578
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,195
I must confess.

579
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,516
Tony, I miss you so much.

580
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,632
Come to my room tonight when
everyone is asleep.

581
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,716
At least for a little while.

582
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,277
You will have a fever tonight.

583
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,197
I must stay here.

584
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,629
Alright, but you'll give me
fifty crowns.

585
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,830
Caroline? - Yes?
- What are you writing?

586
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,520
Orders for the maid for Saturday.

587
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,800
Will it take you long?
- No.

588
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,668
Is the time on the clock correct?

589
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,313
Yes.

590
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,358
Am I disturbing you?
- Not at all. What did you want?

591
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,916
I have something to tell you.

592
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,272
I just remembered.
I've met the counsel's wife today.

593
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,109
She spoke so highly ofyou.
How everyone admires you.

594
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,678
What a spotless man you are. So moral,
honourable with a clear conscience.

595
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,553
A paragon ofan irreproachable man
and husband.

596
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,069
But Iwanted to
- I know you don't like to hear it.

597
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,792
But I am very proud ofyou.

598
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,151
Just imagine, what gossip people
say about others.

599
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,239
I'm not afraid with you, though.
Iwould swear on you.

600
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,592
What was it that you wanted?

601
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,556
It seems you've put me off with
fair words It wasn't so important.

602
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,796
I won't confess then.

603
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,390
My sweet little girl.

604
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:11,029
You rascal. You've got silly ideas.
Just imagine if someone saw me.

605
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,794
Don't put letters under my door.
Just imagine if someone found them.

606
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,394
<i>I'll</i> put them in the library, then.

607
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,479
In the dictionary.
But you must fetch your mail daily.

608
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,875
Who would ever think of something
like that. Our professor.

609
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,753
Such a decent man.

610
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,556
Now tell me what to do.

611
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,399
I can't get over it.

612
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,036
My husband and that woman.
How she crept into our house.

613
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,913
And now, she enticed away our father.

614
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,595
My poor, abandoned children.

615
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,280
Calm down, madam.

616
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,152
<i>Oh WY-</i>

617
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:43,072
You see and they keep saying that
morality is above all else. - Quiet.

618
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,390
Good morning.

619
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,996
How's Ivan?
Is he feeling better?

620
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,750
How did you sleep, madam?

621
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,876
Sit straight, Eve!

622
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,153
Good morning!

623
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,635
Excellent, breakfast is sewed.

624
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,750
Something turned out very well.

625
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,235
How did you sleep?

626
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,711
What's with you, Ivan?

627
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,432
How are you feeling?
How is he, doctor? - He's better.

628
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,120
That's splendid.
Pass me the butter, please.

629
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,310
And put that a bit closer as well.

630
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,795
Over here, thank you.

631
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,756
I had a good night's sleep.
Did you sleep well, dear?

632
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,438
There

633
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,158
Very well.

634
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,636
Oh dear, it's late.
I won't be ready in time.

635
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,392
I must write my lecture.

636
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,274
Tell the maid to bring it to my
room, will you?

637
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,398
Fetch your books, Eve,
and come upstairs.

638
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,078
Don't let it upset you, madam.
<i>l'll</i> settle the matter myself.

639
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,396
What can Ido foryou?

640
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,593
Why are you looking at as ifyou
wanted to eat me alive?

641
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,280
Let's not waste time.

642
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,030
You are probably not aware ofwhat
you have done last night.

643
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,594
Ifyou were, you would have to be
ashamed of yourself!

644
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,312
I beg your pardon!
- Don't interrupt me!

645
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,590
<i>I'll</i> tell you the truth.

646
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,751
The boy wasn't ill at all.

647
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,678
I stayed here only to be close
to you.

648
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,791
And if you want to know,
I fell in love with you!

649
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,399
Stop it!

650
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,512
Ifthere's some virtue left in you,
then pack up and leave this house!

651
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,995
But let me explain.
Wait!

652
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,279
You can be calm now, madam.

653
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,470
She will leave the house, after
what I have told her.

654
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,750
Thank you for your concern, doctor.

655
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,633
Although it seems you are quite
agitated yourself.

656
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,798
Don't be amazed.
I thought better of her.

657
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,148
Until all ofa sudden

658
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,114
Tony, I think it will come to light.

659
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,516
Put 2,000 crowns into this book
and Iwill leave today.

660
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:28,074
I will write the rest in my letter.

661
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,036
Blackmailer!

662
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:29,992
Good Heavens, my dear,
what happened?

663
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,271
Tell me what's wrong.

664
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,036
You have a fever.

665
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,038
I'm so glad you're still here, doctor.

666
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,673
Come upstairs, please.
- What's the matter?

667
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:48,270
My Vera, I mean the governess
Come!

668
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,709
That's out ofthe question.
- I beg your pardon!

669
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,558
Forgive me, professor, but I have
my reasons.

670
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,636
You can't be serious!

671
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,877
It is your duty as a physician
to attend those in need!

672
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,752
As you wish.

673
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,955
But you will stay here.

674
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,629
Let me be and leave!
- I'm not here to amuse myself.

675
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,959
Leave me alone!
- I won't ask you.

676
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,998
Lie down.
- How dare you! - Quiet.

677
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,515
That's the limit.
- Hush!

678
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:41,472
What people dare to do nowadays!
- Enough! Take a deep breath.

679
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,918
Don't breathe.
- That's easy for you to say.

680
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,278
What do you dream about?
- You flip!

681
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,232
Sit!

682
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,959
No, I look awful like that.

683
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,640
Show me your tongue.
It's pretty sharp.

684
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,556
Do you feel any pain?

685
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,511
I do and quite big.

686
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:21,110
Where? - In my heart.
- I see. That's none of my business.

687
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,879
That's enough!
<i>l'll</i> speak now as a patient.

688
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,551
And wipe the dust everywhere,
please.

689
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:36,476
And I had to promise daddy
that lwon't tell anyone.

690
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,989
It would never cross my mind
that you are his daughter.

691
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,475
You see, you bugbear.

692
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,910
I've suspected you
of such awful things.

693
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,600
You should beg my pardon now.

694
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,077
Easy, easy.
No intimacies.

695
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:57,151
Just imagine that after so many years
of exemplary family life,

696
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:02,155
he runs wild with a governess.
- With that new governess?

697
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,951
I beg your pardon, it's my illness.
- I'm so unhappy.

698
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,350
You're not jealous, are you?

699
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,393
I think I am.

700
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,879
Calm down. I'm going with you
and <i>I'll</i> put things in order.

701
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,949
Farewell, professor.

702
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,196
You're leaving already, doctor?

703
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,436
Tell me, how is the miss,
is it serious?

704
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,711
You can be calm,
she is in good health.

705
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,392
Miss!

706
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,433
I must talk to you.
- Yes, madam.

707
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,357
I don't understand why I should
confess just now. What's going on?

708
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,597
You're a silly foot. You were ringing
the alarm when nothing was going on.

709
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,756
And when something is going on,
you know nothing about it.

710
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,871
What should I know?
- What should you know?

711
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,151
Your whole family saw you
enter Vera's room.

712
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,871
When?
- When? Last night.

713
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,592
Alright, Iwill confess,
but how am I supposed to say it

714
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:44,669
in front ofthe children?
- The children saw you too last night.

715
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:49,159
The children saw me too?
- They did.

716
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,475
Say it in front of everyone.

717
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,558
Young people today are quite
different.

718
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:03,068
This is terrible. I will confess,
but don't leave me, please.

719
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,431
I won't. But let's go.

720
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:13,669
I see horrible things.
- Go on.

721
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,000
No.
- Really.

722
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,756
Watch out, father is coming!

723
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,391
You are here?

724
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,476
That's good.

725
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:56,231
Come here. I mean there's no need,
since you're already here.

726
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:02,800
I want to tell you something.
Be quiet, please.

727
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:07,831
My dear wife, children and you.

728
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:14,077
After long consideration,
I have decided that

729
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,633
Sit straight, Eve.

730
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,599
The thing is,

731
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,639
I have something to tell you

732
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,869
What? I'll gladly

733
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,150
Don't kick the table, Ivan.

734
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:34,673
In short, I have
- In short, he wants to confide in you.

735
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:38,759
Yes. <i>I'll</i> put it straight.
There's no other way, is there?

736
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,035
What did I tell you, Ivan.

737
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,151
Be quiet, please.

738
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,236
Break the news with care.

739
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,596
I have a child born out of wedlock.

740
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,870
Pass me the thumb-stall, Eve.

741
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,393
I'm telling you I have a child
born out of wedlock.

742
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,472
Why don't you do something,
be angry!

743
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,354
Why should I be angry?
I know it already.

744
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,752
Daddy!

745
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,030
Morality Above All Else.

746
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,677
Hurry up, children.

747
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,951
I can't be late for my own
revelation.

748
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:46,116
Good Lord, I'm so nenlous,
I wish I didn't have to go there.

749
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,117
What's taking mother so long?

750
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,596
I don't know.
- Go and get her, hurry!

751
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,276
Mummy is coming.

752
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,274
Oh my.
- What's that oh my!

753
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,038
Oh my!

754
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:12,478
Mummy, you look very nice.
- You're so pretty.

755
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,558
Pretty? She's beautiful.

756
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,916
At last.

757
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,558
And you're wearing perfume.
What happened to you?

758
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:26,678
You're amazed at how I turned
even/thing upside down, aren't you?

759
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,592
I almost forgot this.

760
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,275
I couldn't stand it for a long time.

761
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,556
Ladies and gentlemen.

762
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:57,633
Now, let us hear a word
from our dear chairman.

763
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,636
Ladies and gentlemen.

764
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,716
Morality above all else.

765
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,272
I beg you, let me finish.

766
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:17,154
It's true I always declared morality
to be above all else.

767
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,959
Yet, one must not exaggerate.

768
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:25,069
Over the last few days, I dealt with
a minor matter in my private life

769
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:30,317
and found myself absorbed
in thought about my motto.

770
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:34,917
And I asked myself:
What is morality?

771
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,669
I consulted handbooks, I browsed
through various brochures,

772
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,316
I even noted this from
an encyclopaedia.

773
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,398
Just a moment, it will interest you.
I have it right here.

774
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,350
Morality. Aset of rules recognized
in a certain society

775
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,955
the rules in the society
to be kept.

776
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,955
This clearly implies
that we know nothing.

777
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:03,835
Let me tell you something practical
about morality from my own experience.

778
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:08,711
Morality cannot be taught.
We carry it inside ourselves.

779
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,276
Morality is a pan ofour character
and of our conscience.

780
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,789
What's moral for one person isn't
necessarily moral for another.

781
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,799
If young and pretty girls, who
rightly want to please our eyes,

782
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:24,119
wear make-up and perfume, they can
still be honourable and moral.

783
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:28,796
On the other hand, less attractive
and older women, who would

784
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,673
like to please our eyes,
yet it would be of no use to them

785
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,554
They have no other option than
to guise themselves in principles,

786
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,433
which they call morality.

787
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,916
After all, this is confirmed
by the fact

788
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:49,316
that members of morality societies
are not young and pretty girls,

789
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:54,396
but quite on the contrary.

790
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,429
Morality is a question of opinion.

791
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,394
Nevertheless, we must not confuse it
with shyness and hypocrisy.

792
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:07,640
All that is natural and truthful,
is also moral.

793
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:17,395
I've just remembered something.
It certainly is not moral to pretend

794
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:21,075
to be moved to tears by one's own
morality, but it definitely is

795
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:25,557
more moral to admit that I'm flushed
from pure rum.

796
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:27,708
Jamaican.

797
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,753
And don't believe that long skirts
always mean morality.

798
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:35,031
Sometimes, they only hide
splay feet.

799
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,271
Very well. There's one more thing
I'd like to say.

800
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:41,552
It is definitely more moral to tell
the truth to someone in the face,

801
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,116
than to backbite and pretend
to be a friend.

802
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,118
Very well.

803
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:53,115
Finally, I would like to say that
this day will always be a warning

804
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:56,676
for me to act honestly
and to speak the truth.

805
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,315
And if I do lie someday
then let this statue of mine,

806
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:05,798
this cold metal,
grin at me in malicious irony.

807
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:08,989
The End

807
