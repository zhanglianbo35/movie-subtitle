1
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,160
<i>If there were a higher power
that could bring back</i>

2
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,720
<i>everyone related
to the gold of the Territory:</i>

3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,920
<i>who died on the route,</i>

4
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,120
<i>or lost their way on the continent,</i>

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,680
<i>they would've done it all over again.</i>

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,440
<i>Not for the sake of money,</i>

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,360
<i>they'd learned the true worth
of it in the Territory.</i>

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,920
<i>And not in the name of duty,</i>

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,960
<i>one's true duty lies within,
rather than in words.</i>

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,480
<i>And not for glory.</i>

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,440
<i>But for the sake of the unknown,</i>

12
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,600
<i>which is the beginning and the drive
of any person's life.</i>

13
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,160
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY,
MAIN OFFICE

14
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,640
Over the past three years,
gold production on the River

15
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,520
has suffered a drastic fall.

16
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,560
In 1958 we reduced production
by five hundred kilograms.

17
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,720
Last year we lost a ton and a half.

18
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,360
MEETING OF CHIEF ENGINEERS

19
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,480
There are no new mine fields,

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,160
the increase in gold reserves
is negligible.

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,720
If nothing changes, many heads
will roll, mine first of all,

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,160
and all of you are looking
at a dreary joyless retirement.

23
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,320
The plan is to cut all costs,
except for those for gold.

24
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,440
For example, the Territory,
comrade Chinkov.

25
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,240
Tell us why do we need
the Territory's tin?

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,040
Just in case.

27
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,320
Comrade Sergushova will write
about gold search.

28
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,920
She's a journalist from Leningrad.

29
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,960
Well…

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,400
Where was I?

31
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,600
Why do we need the Territory's tin?

32
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,080
Yes. Why do we need the Territory's tin?

33
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,800
It's been proposed to close
the geological survey there.

34
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,720
I don't care about Buddha.

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,760
The Territory is just
one of seven surveys.

36
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,680
It can be shut down.

37
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,640
Especially since
it's a tin-bearing province.

38
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,760
Nobody here believes it has gold.

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,160
You can believe or not believe in ideas,

40
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,960
but gold is quite a tangible thing.

41
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,240
You can know or not know about it.
Unfortunately we do not know

42
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,360
whether there is any gold
in the Territory.

43
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,800
<i>Chinkov stopped listening.</i>

44
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,640
<i>He remembered the smell of cedar scrub,</i>

45
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,360
<i>the smoke of forgotten campfires
and confidence in his own success.</i>

46
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,880
<i>They think Chinkov is finished,
but he hasn't even started yet.</i>

47
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,640
<i>Now. It's time to act.</i>

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,960
I won't give you the Territory.

49
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,800
Ilya Nikolaevich!

50
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,400
I want to write
about the Territory's gold.

51
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,200
I am glad. But you've just heard
that there isn't and can't be any!

52
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,040
I will write about the Territory's gold!

53
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,480
THERE IS NO RECORD OF ANY GOLD

54
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,000
KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN MINED
IN THE TERRITORY

55
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,920
HEADQUARTERS OF THE TERRITORY
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY TEAM

56
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,400
This is what summer looks like this year.

57
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,480
In the mountains in the south
the larch has already blossomed.

58
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,080
<i>Genrikh Furdetsky has been appointed</i>

59
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,280
<i>the Head of the Territory Survey
only a month ago.</i>

60
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,320
<i>The management believed that,
even if Furdetsky was a loser,</i>

61
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,160
<i>Chinkov would still manage the Survey,</i>

62
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,520
<i>and if he was to be reckoned with</i>

63
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,880
<i>it he might be used
as a counterbalance to Chinkov.</i>

64
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,560
What can I do for you, Ilya Nikolaevich?

65
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,040
I'm staying here.

66
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,800
They've called you, haven't they?

67
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,920
I'm staying on at the Survey,
so we'll have to work together.

68
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,600
I am always happy to.

69
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,720
Get in my way and I'll destroy you.

70
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,120
It's in your interest to join my team.

71
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,240
What exactly do you want?

72
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,120
Very little. Don't act behind my back.

73
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,920
No messages to the town without approval.

74
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,120
I implement production tasks,
you provide support,

75
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,760
plus accommodation, equipment, logistics.

76
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,240
Everything according to regulations.

77
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,880
I suggest you don't waste time,
just agree.

78
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,960
A complete muddle.

79
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,360
What constitutes this… phenomenon?

80
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,200
I've seen the barracks. The boys left
for tundra months ago,

81
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,600
and there's still ice in the corners.

82
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,040
They're not boys, they're geologists.

83
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,240
Household is Survey Head
Furdetsky's business.

84
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,800
Of course, you have greater concerns!

85
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,160
Projects!

86
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,280
Prize-winners and banquets.

87
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,000
Come autumn, and the boys are back,

88
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,920
I'll elect myself
to the trade union committee

89
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,680
and declare war on you padishahs.

90
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,400
Here I thought, old fool,
I can't be surprised anymore.

91
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,880
Tell Kutsenko -
tomorrow we'll set out to Mongolov.

92
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,360
They'll hardly be glad to see you.

93
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,640
<i>Ilya Nikolaevich Chinkov,
nicknamed Buddha,</i>

94
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,560
<i>came to the River as a young engineer.</i>

95
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,760
<i>There he laid
the foundation of a future legend,</i>

96
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,520
<i>based on ruthlessness towards himself
and others, and luck.</i>

97
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,640
<i>He discovered one
of the biggest goldfields of the country.</i>

98
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,880
<i>But half a year ago he unexpectedly
applied to be transferred</i>

99
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,800
<i>to the Territory, a remote
Geological Survey</i>

100
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,240
<i>on the shore of the Arctic Ocean.</i>

101
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,320
THOUGH…

102
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,760
THE WEAK WON'T SURVIVE

103
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,160
THE ELGAI RIVER VALLEY,
EASTERN MINES

104
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,640
Pull!

105
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,880
Greetings, Comrade Chief!

106
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,720
How is it going?

107
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,480
There's nothing in this pit
except my salary.

108
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,560
How far have you gone?

109
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,880
We've reached eight meters.
Kid is panning out the samples.

110
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,000
Comrade Mongolov,
two intruders are approaching the base.

111
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,240
Barreling boldly.
There's liquor in their backpacks.

112
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,560
I don't see them.

113
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,960
Chief, give us some, please?

114
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,440
I'll drink and do
an Indian dance called "Ganges".

115
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,880
How are you doing, Kid?

116
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,120
Get the samples to the base by noon.

117
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,280
Will do, Chief. Will be there on the dot.

118
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,840
Sir!

119
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,040
I'll bring it all.

120
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,400
-Ilya Nikolaevich!
-Vladimir Mikhailovich!

121
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,160
This is Klim Alekseevich Kutsenko,

122
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,680
the best sluicer of Severstroi.

123
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,920
If you would be so kind
as to whip up some tea and soup.

124
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,400
Vladimir Mikhailovich,

125
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,320
could you ever believe in the
industrial gold in the Territory?

126
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,480
I think there's no industrial gold here.

127
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,120
That's all guff and crude hullabaloo.

128
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,880
No need for trousers?

129
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,160
Sorry, there's only one bottle, so

130
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,880
I'm counting on your profound
moderation in the use of alcohol.

131
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,640
The samples are coming. I'll have a look!

132
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,400
Well, Vladimir Mikhailovich!

133
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,600
Are you planning
to dig in the upper riches?

134
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,400
Check for gold,

135
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,680
pass both tributaries?

136
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,720
No.
We have an approved the project for tin.

137
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,560
There is no gold here.

138
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,200
The traces we get here
are the same as in Moscow.

139
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,040
This is a tin-bearing province.

140
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,080
Gold and tin don't mix.
Everyone knows that.

141
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,520
Well, I'm not everyone. I'm Chinkov.

142
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,000
You shouldn't use a painted pan.

143
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,440
Doesn't hold the sample well.

144
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,440
Yeah, it's painted, how did you…

145
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,560
When you pan, don't drain from the corner.

146
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,200
Use the plane surface and swirl.

147
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,520
Yes, exactly, I pour from the corner.
I like to do it like that.

148
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,520
No gold bits here,

149
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,520
but I fancy there ought to be
in this soil.

150
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,160
Three years ago

151
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,960
my old friend Mikhail Katinsky
led a party to a river here.

152
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,560
The tundra devil tossed him
three test pits

153
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,480
with samples of weighable gold.

154
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,440
Katinsky wrote a report
to retarget his party for gold.

155
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,520
After that,
he didn't find a single sample.

156
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,440
They badgered him…

157
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,960
Delicious!

158
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,880
So, where are your people?

159
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,200
Baklakov should return today.

160
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,280
Foreman Salakhov's group left
on a multi-day route.

161
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,320
They're going back through
Katinsky's ground

162
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,320
if you're interested.

163
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,000
I need to know where the cassiterite ends.

164
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,280
The Vatap River basin is to the east.
We don't know anything about it.

165
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,760
In that regard, do you want to try
beyond the Vatap River?

166
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,240
Send your Baklakov out to check it
for about twenty days.

167
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,240
We need boats to get across.
That's a route a group should take.

168
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,800
I was living well then:

169
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,160
I had a machine gun -
border patrol gave it to me.

170
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,080
And I had a horse called Galya.

171
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,320
It was a good horse,

172
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,600
didn't wash clothes, that's all.

173
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,840
Are you Baklakov?

174
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,480
Yes.

175
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,080
What do you think of a solitary
route for fifteen or twenty days?

176
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,680
It can be done. That's fine.

177
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,840
It's impossible to carry it out "fine".

178
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,040
It's through granite massifs.
You'd have to take a lot of samples.

179
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,040
To the Vatap River
and further into the Ketung Plateau.

180
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,520
Five or six hundred kilometers.

181
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,880
I'll do it.

182
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,000
And how do you
intend to cross the Vatap River?

183
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,160
Don't know. I need to take a look.

184
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,840
Yes, yes. Apparently,
this route is just what you need.

185
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,200
Go to sleep.

186
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,320
Comrade Mongolov and I will decide.

187
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,480
Vladimir Mikhailovich!

188
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,480
We need to talk.

189
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Let's go.

190
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,880
Vladimir Mikhailovich!
I agree with your decision

191
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,560
to send Baklakov
on multi-day reconnaissance survey.

192
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,560
It's the right decision.

193
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,360
Sergey! Bring the Dahmer Map.

194
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:00,400
In the pack box, under the table,
the red one!

195
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,680
What is this show for?

196
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,560
I was afraid you'd object. Decided to
pin you down.

197
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,480
You could simply give an order.

198
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,480
Then I'd be taking responsibility,

199
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,400
and the Survey doesn't need
emergencies connected with my name.

200
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,720
-Are you afraid to be accountable?
-Heaven forbid.

201
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,040
Look around you.
Severstroi is all around us,

202
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,280
people like me aren't put on trial here.
I'm Buddha!

203
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,120
Why do you need this trip, Ilya?

204
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,960
Have a look!

205
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,360
Where's that from?

206
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,160
Panned it in the upper reaches
of that river. Kutsenko has a rare gift.

207
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,560
I have a feeling, Vladimir Mikhailovich,

208
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,640
that in your pits
there should be weighable gold.

209
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,160
I vouch for my sluicers.

210
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,000
You have the right to investigate.

211
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,240
<i>Salakhov worked two seasons for Katinsky.</i>

212
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,720
<i>It was Katinsky who made him a sluicer.</i>

213
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,280
THE SERAYA RIVER, OLD BASE

214
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,040
<i>Three years ago he panned
the those nuggets for Katinsky</i>

215
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,360
<i>in this place.</i>

216
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,240
<i>The nuggets ruined Katinsky's life.</i>

217
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
<i>Salakhov felt guilty.</i>

218
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,840
Why are we stuck on this rusty old spot,
when it's barren after all?

219
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,360
These are the last samples.

220
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,920
Finish them and we'll leave.

221
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,280
Be patient, God of Fire!

222
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,920
It's fine. I am patient.

223
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,080
I've caught a little cold. I'm sorry.

224
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,760
UPSTREAM THE ELGAI RIVER

225
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,120
I took a note of this place

226
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
back when we headed for the base.

227
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,800
This is my personal request,
Klim Alekseevich.

228
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,000
I understand.

229
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,680
Sluice to the last open water,
to the ice buildup.

230
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,240
Then leave for Mongolov's base.
They'll wait for you there.

231
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,640
I'll pick you up myself.

232
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,480
Just don't tell anyone about this.

233
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,520
<i>His heart gave exactly
sixty beats per minute,</i>

234
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,680
<i>his blood ran smooth
and powerful through his veins.</i>

235
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,640
<i>He was enjoying
that special kind of comfort</i>

236
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,160
<i>that a wanderer creates wherever he goes.</i>

237
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,560
<i>Perfect is the country of colorful
tundra, dark mountains, and pallid sky.</i>

238
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,520
<i>Perfect is the solitude of the surveyor</i>

239
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,800
<i>amid unknown mountains and valleys.</i>

240
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,160
<i>It's perfect to never die,</i>

241
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,960
<i>and Baklakov didn't doubt for a minute
that he was immortal.</i>

242
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:42,040
<i>There are no limits and no borders.
It's just normal eternal life.</i>

243
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,760
THE SERAYA RIVER

244
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,600
<i>For the first time Kutsenko
was fulfilling Chinkov's request,</i>

245
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,160
<i>and not an order.</i>

246
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,920
<i>He was zealous.</i>

247
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,240
<i>Fate had brought them together
after the war.</i>

248
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,920
<i>Three years Chinkov spent drilling him,</i>

249
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,520
<i>making him guess even before panning</i>

250
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,080
<i>whether there was gold there or not.</i>

251
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,360
<i>And Kutsenko was carried away by it all</i>

252
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,920
<i>the pan became part of him.
He dreamed of tails, sandbars,</i>

253
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,400
<i>shoals and slate druses.</i>

254
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,520
<i>His luck found him when he made
a checking tour of Nadezhda Stream.</i>

255
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,240
<i>Other panners had declared
that stream to be empty.</i>

256
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,160
<i>Kutsenko spent twice the allotted time
there and found gold.</i>

257
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,480
<i>Then, following Chinkov's example,</i>

258
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,040
<i>they started calling him Klim Alekseevich.</i>

259
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,640
All I need is a mug of liquor

260
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,760
and a hunk of venison.

261
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,080
I ruined myself with alcohol.

262
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,160
Now I've sworn off it.

263
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,920
Did they treat it?

264
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,480
No. Treated myself.

265
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,840
When my wife died, I stopped.

266
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,240
You won't start again?

267
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,360
No.

268
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,600
I have children to care for.

269
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,600
I've got two,

270
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,920
Mishka and Tosya.

271
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,600
I got them out of the orphanage.

272
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,600
They live with my sister.

273
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,800
I send her all my wages.

274
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,200
They write: "Daddy, come home."

275
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:31,040
Ilya Nikolaevich is right -
this is a country of great opportunities.

276
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,160
I won't give you the Territory!

277
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,200
THE VATAP RIVER

278
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,320
THE INFLUX OF THE SERAYA RIVER
TO THE ELGAI RIVER

279
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,080
<i>The God of Fire was tortured
by the imperfection of his own life.</i>

280
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,400
<i>He had neither a son Mishka
nor a daughter Tosya</i>

281
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,840
<i>and he had never been married.</i>

282
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,480
<i>But his dream of a life all normal
people live was so great</i>

283
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,120
<i>that he confused it with reality.</i>

284
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,120
Why are there so many people

285
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,600
who tried to live,

286
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,920
but failed?

287
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,840
CAMP OF HERDSMAN KYAYE

288
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,040
<i>Many people had come Kyaye's way
in the course of his long life.</i>

289
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,000
<i>He liked to think about them,
about the words they had spoken.</i>

290
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,400
<i>Some of them had smelled of sweat.</i>

291
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,480
<i>Even their thoughts,
Kyaye felt, smelled of work.</i>

292
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,320
<i>He respected them.</i>

293
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,240
<i>Others smelled of money.
Kyaye was sorry for them.</i>

294
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,000
<i>It made him angry when people
said that life was good or bad.</i>

295
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,040
<i>It was simply varied.</i>

296
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,160
<i>It was absurd to think
that money could improve it.</i>

297
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,400
<i>Kyaye's memory retained
the smells of herbs, ice, spring snow,</i>

298
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,480
<i>a flight of a frost-coated raven
and its hoarse caw across the snows,</i>

299
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,400
<i>a fall of a wolf shot down,</i>

300
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,480
<i>and taste of deer meat.</i>

301
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,800
<i>Every day and every hour his memory
also held the sad recognition</i>

302
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,760
<i>of the inevitable succession
of snows, rains, and human lives.</i>

303
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,600
<i>What struck Kyaye most of all was
the inevitability of change.</i>

304
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,080
<i>It could not be halted.</i>

305
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,520
Mikhailovich.

306
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,280
How are the samples?

307
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,640
The Chief Engineer was here.

308
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,880
He showed me gold
panned in the upper reaches.

309
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,040
Katinsky had the same.

310
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,560
We spent five days on Katinsky's old base.

311
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,320
There's nothing… Neither gold, nor tin.

312
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,840
Chinkov thinks we should have
weighable gold here.

313
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,480
What's going on?

314
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,920
What's going on? Speak!

315
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,520
On the day Chinkov arrived,

316
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,640
three flakes were found in a sample…

317
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,280
I don't know why I took them.

318
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,280
I thought I'd put them in a letter
and send them to Sonya.

319
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,880
We went to school together.

320
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,440
I got into circus training.
I thought I'd impress her.

321
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,480
And she said: "Why not a waiter?"

322
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,960
She liked Jack London's heroes.

323
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,920
That's why I'm here…

324
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,360
I immediately wrote to her
about gold, and that I work panning.

325
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,720
She began to send me long letters…

326
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,480
I took the gold right before you came,
of all times,

327
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,480
I couldn't give it back…

328
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,920
Gray called me an asshole. Because of you.

329
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,720
Threw the flakes into the water.

330
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,080
I'm ashamed.

331
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,040
You little merchants!

332
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
They throw nuggets away.

333
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,800
Sons of bitches…

334
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,480
Is it your gold?

335
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,440
It belongs to the state!

336
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,560
Criminals.

337
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,160
I'm ready to face my punishment.

338
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,520
What? Do you want to be tried?

339
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,480
To ruin your life?

340
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,160
Well.

341
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,520
No one else needs to know.

342
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,080
Don't do it, Vladimir Mikhailovich.

343
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,720
This'll make you an accessory.

344
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,040
Get out!

345
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,200
Redeem it through work.

346
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,880
Tamara,

347
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,320
did you hear a gunshot?

348
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,960
I don't know.

349
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:03,760
Probably the gunshot came
from beyond the distant hills of Time.

350
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,880
Maybe it rang out many years ago

351
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,360
and has now returned.

352
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,440
Or it came from the future…

353
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,640
That's probably it.

354
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,440
<i>Next morning, Mongolov left
for the lower reaches of Elgai.</i>

355
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,720
<i>It was confirmation
of an old adage known to all prospectors:</i>

356
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,680
<i>when a district is barren,</i>

357
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,120
<i>you must work three times harder
to prove it's barren.</i>

358
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,160
<i>He discovered cinnabar by chance:</i>

359
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,160
<i>no one in the Territory
expected to find it there.</i>

360
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,800
<i>Mongolov discovered a deposit
of mercury of global importance.</i>

361
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,160
Stick to a different road.

362
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,400
Go the other way.

363
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,240
Don't harm the light-faced ones.
Have mercy. Take care of them.

364
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,920
Hey!

365
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,640
Anybody there?

366
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,720
I'm a geologist. I'm ill.

367
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,720
A geologist - that is good.

368
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,920
I'm a herdsman. I know you're ill.

369
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,120
I heard a gunshot.

370
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,120
So I look, and there's a tent.

371
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:02,200
No one gets out in the morning,
no one in the evening.

372
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,320
Sure he must be ill.

373
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,600
Is your herd far away?

374
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,880
It will take you an hour and a half.

375
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,880
I suppose you should go.

376
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,880
If you stay alone, you die. For sure.

377
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,200
My name is Kyaye.

378
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,280
THE LOSINAYA RIVER,
REMOTE SURVEY TEAM

379
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,400
Don't you have you any icons here?

380
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,440
Is there nothing for us to pray to?

381
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,640
I'm tired out.

382
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,640
Perhaps I'd better take a bath.

383
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,480
Coffee and a cigar wouldn't hurt either.

384
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,160
What do you think, Apryatin?

385
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,760
It'd be nice to know with whom
Jeanne Bose sleeps as well.

386
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,000
And what's the news on flying saucers.

387
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,560
Here.

388
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,160
Human remains and these things.

389
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,200
It must have been
the second Soyuz-zoloto tour.

390
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,520
Don't forget to radio.

391
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,880
-Do you think we have to report?
-We're obliged to.

392
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,840
Though I could do the rites myself.

393
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,840
The grave of an unknown martyr.

394
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,320
A mystery of the tundra.

395
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,280
From clay we come,
to clay we shall return.

396
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,280
Such is the sad finale.

397
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,720
<i>Tamara was sitting half naked</i>

398
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,760
<i>as per the ancient custom
of the women of the tribe.</i>

399
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,800
<i>The naked body was a norm
to their way of life.</i>

400
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,680
<i>It was rational and healthy.</i>

401
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,960
<i>Kyaye was pleased his granddaughter
observed the custom</i>

402
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,840
<i>and allowed her body to breathe.</i>

403
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,520
Eat, eat.

404
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,120
In the morning you eat,

405
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,440
in the afternoon you eat,
in the evening and at night you eat.

406
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,080
And when you feel you're strong again,
you go.

407
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,280
My granddaughter
will take you to the trail.

408
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,320
A deer walks,

409
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,600
a bear walks,

410
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,160
a geologist will make it.

411
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,840
<i>Zhora Apryatin, Chief of the
Far Reconnaissance Survey</i>

412
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,960
<i>in public tried to keep up with the
ideal created by his imagination -</i>

413
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,760
<i>the strong silent man, ready with his gun.</i>

414
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,480
<i>Zhora Apryatin, the Polar wolf.</i>

415
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,880
<i>Nature had certainly begun Zhora
on the Viking model.</i>

416
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,480
<i>But stepped aside somewhere along the way</i>

417
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,960
<i>and left his grandfather to do the job.</i>

418
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,520
<i>A geographer, explorer of Central Asia.</i>

419
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,160
-Report.
-The remains are found--

420
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,720
Report that to him. Tell me your results.

421
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,480
What results?!

422
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:19,000
-Can a helicopter reach that place?
-Not without refueling.

423
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,400
-What about on foot?
-Two days.

424
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,280
Major, have you decided?

425
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:36,600
Let them bury him and write it down,
it's a clear case.

426
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:41,040
And please check how
explosives are stored on the base.

427
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,120
Does your area have
a gold-bearing potential?

428
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,120
Otto Yanovich chose our area--

429
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,600
I'm not interested in what he thought.

430
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,280
This isn't a testing ground
for experiments.

431
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,520
Here's the order, Apryatin.

432
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,600
By autumn you will report to me

433
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,760
on the gold-bearing potential.

434
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,560
We have an approved task.

435
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,280
I don't care.
Consider it canceled, right now, by me.

436
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,640
Why the argument?

437
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,960
We are working mainly in the mountains.

438
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,480
We should pan the upper reaches
of the basic water flows.

439
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,840
Wash the samples rough.

440
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,240
Stop the trenching.
Send the diggers to the pits.

441
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,400
Just two or three survey lines
at the main streams.

442
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,240
There's nothing to argue about!

443
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,440
That's reasonable.

444
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,000
I ask you not to raise your voice at me.

445
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,080
And give me precise
instructions on the gold.

446
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,200
And I ask for a notice in writing.

447
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,720
I can't change the plan without that.

448
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,520
Geologists are not just engineers.

449
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,520
We must have a code of honor.

450
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,800
Your colleague died while searching
for gold here.

451
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,720
His work's results are unknown.

452
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,400
But to do a simple duty to him,

453
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,360
you ask for a bit of paper!

454
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,440
Empty rhetoric.

455
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,840
Your demands are empty rhetoric!

456
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,480
You know the order.
Gurin will tell you how to carry it out.

457
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,360
Your grandfather
would be ashamed of you, Apryatin.

458
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,680
How well he played you, Georgy.

459
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,280
That's a boss!
He has a goal. He has brains.

460
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,040
And no qualms known as ethics.

461
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,360
He is a bad man.

462
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,400
He flogged you. Take it like a man.

463
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,400
And remember - you'll see who wins
only in the end.

464
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,320
I'll bury the martyr.

465
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,920
What to choose, a cross or a pillar?

466
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,800
Decide for yourself.
You're a cynic, Andrey. It's disgusting.

467
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,480
I'm not a cynic.
I'm an individualist philosopher.

468
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,360
THE KETUNG PLATEAU

469
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,760
<i>The Territory Survey
was famous for one thing:</i>

470
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,760
<i>its geologists were regarded
as the Old Believers.</i>

471
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:52,920
<i>Legs were their means of transport,
the hammer was their tool of knowledge,</i>

472
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,840
all else was from the Evil One.

473
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,080
<i>The Severstroi principles
were hold sacred.</i>

474
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,120
<i>The main one being formulated</i>

475
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,840
<i>by Joseph Conrad,
long before Severstroi existed.</i>

476
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,240
<i>It was summed up in a brief maxim.</i>

477
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,440
<i>Do or die.</i>

478
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,520
THE TERRITORY

479
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,480
Half of them have
two or three valuable professions.

480
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,600
Half of them are pure gems
in their fields.

481
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,760
When they're sober.

482
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,880
Take the ones that I offer.

483
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,480
And remember that you can never

484
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:39,000
make a person be a human
being under the threat of beating.

485
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,320
I've handed over the materials.
Fix me up somewhere.

486
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,240
Sergey! Ragged muzzle.

487
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,880
Barrack 25, but only in a week.
It's not quite finished yet.

488
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,600
I'll live at the construction site.

489
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,600
Write out the voucher.
I'll bring my things.

490
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,520
Come along to my mine, engineer.

491
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,600
I'll give you a place to live. A salary.

492
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,480
You can bring along a wife.

493
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,720
I bet you're dreaming of them, eh?

494
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,120
Many roads lead to the capital
of the Soviet Lithuania

495
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,560
and are directed from the city
to its suburbs.

496
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,480
From the East and the West,
from the North and the South

497
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:01,200
we see the characteristic Vilnius
landscape everywhere.

498
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:08,200
And going down to the valley
from the mountains surrounding Vilnius

499
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:14,040
we always admire
the beautiful city and its suburbs.

500
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,760
Chief! Digging pits in autumn?!

501
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,880
When the permafrost is thawing?

502
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,320
I'd shove you
into this mess of clay and water

503
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,480
and keep there for a day.

504
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,120
Phoenix!

505
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,320
Only plebs believe happiness is

506
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,960
about lying backside up and doing nothing.

507
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,000
Isn't that what I am? I am a pleb.

508
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,720
You're working in the Arctic.
There are no plebs here.

509
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,200
Who digs the trenches then?

510
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,200
Princes? Crouched in those trenches?

511
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:04,040
No, Chief.
We don't understand idiotic orders.

512
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,720
Tomorrow's the last day.
In the vicinities of Vilnius.

513
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,840
Enough. It's an ultimatum.

514
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,080
Finish your dinner, chaps. Break.

515
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,720
Yes?

516
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,160
What is it, what do you need?

517
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,080
Well… We're the only occupants
of this unfinished house…

518
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,360
I would like…

519
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,120
Did you dump the compote?

520
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,840
I needed a can. I make tea
in a can. It has a different taste.

521
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,160
Who are you?

522
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,200
Sergey Baklakov. Geologist.
Just back from the field.

523
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,560
Every night all sorts barge
in here with cognac…

524
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,200
We'll fend them off.

525
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,280
I want to eat like a stray cat. Or a dog.

526
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,160
Like a stray cat-dog.

527
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,840
-What's your name?
-What's my name?

528
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,680
The honorable Comrade Sergushova,
that's what.

529
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,560
Go bring some compote.

530
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:08,920
Hey, joker, either climb in or close it!

531
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:39,080
Konstantin Vasilchikov.
Tank tester. In the past.

532
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,600
Ilya Chinkov. Gold prospector.

533
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:04,600
What, you're feeling sick out there too?

534
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,240
No, no.

535
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:26,280
<i>The bomb is rumbling</i>

536
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:30,120
<i>Like a heavy bass</i>

537
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,440
When we liberated Austria from the Nazis,

538
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:39,600
I served a year there in a special team -
we gathered technology…

539
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,720
My landlady, Frau Louisa,

540
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,360
would bring coffee
to my room every morning.

541
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,480
And cream. In separate chinaware.

542
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,160
Real Chinese porcelain, by the way…

543
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,160
Well, women are always women.

544
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,080
They brew good coffee in Vienna…

545
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,360
Yeah…

546
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,640
My son would have turned twenty today.

547
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,600
The war began,
and I was here looking for gold.

548
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,680
I didn't make it to him, to Leningrad…

549
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,760
The twists of life…

550
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:34,080
How can you guess where it,
life that is, has a hidden crack.

551
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,240
Just a small load and that's it…

552
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,760
It should be fried without oil,

553
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:04,560
never close the cover, and remove it
as soon as the venison turns white.

554
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,960
You do it all so deftly,
whereas I can't do anything.

555
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,680
This is called pasteurized venison.

556
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,160
Geology is a culinary profession.

557
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,480
Why're you staring at me? Yes, I'm hungry.

558
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,120
It's embarrassing to watch a person eat.

559
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,520
I've never been a breadwinner.

560
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:37,440
It's nice. When things are simple,
I enjoy being with people.

561
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,480
Tell me something heroic instead.

562
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,680
Have you ever stood
inspired beside a mound or a river

563
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,200
and thought: there'll be a city here!

564
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,320
What am I, an emperor?

565
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,000
Best case, we dream like this:

566
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,040
here there'll be
three drilling rigs, ten tents,

567
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,800
and fifty men.

568
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,040
Good evening.

569
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,360
Why are you so uptight?

570
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,640
Have you brought me a medal?
Or an eviction notice?

571
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,240
-Will you fly?
-Yes.

572
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,720
I'll try to draw up a leave of absence
and everything.

573
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,480
See me in the morning.
It'll take five days at least.

574
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,360
Goodbye.

575
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,400
THE LOSINAYA RIVER

576
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,880
<i>Zhora Apryatin's team was rafting
the river in rubber boats.</i>

577
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,440
<i>In late winter, on the cusp of spring</i>

578
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,960
<i>when the ragged topography
of the tundra is blown by snow</i>

579
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:15,160
<i>prospecting parties get
to the mountains by planes.</i>

580
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:19,040
<i>In autumn when it's impossible
to land a plane on the rocks,</i>

581
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,560
<i>there are only two ways:</i>

582
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:25,280
<i>they are either picked up by
tractor trains, if possible,</i>

583
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:29,040
<i>or go on foot
to the river, then raft to the ocean,</i>

584
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:32,360
<i>where they are picked up
by any available means.</i>

585
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,480
<i>The latter is the most dangerous.</i>

586
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:38,120
<i>Many geologists were lost
finishing the season in such a way.</i>

587
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,400
<i>When he finished panning,
Kutsenko went to Mongolov's base.</i>

588
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,640
<i>If Ilya Nikolaevich said they
would be waiting for him,</i>

589
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,920
<i>then they were waiting for him.</i>

590
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:06,520
<i>The frosts had begun.
The rivers froze over night.</i>

591
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,800
<i>Apryatin suffered from cold
and the knowledge</i>

592
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,280
<i>that the work had been done badly.</i>

593
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,760
<i>There was no model survey,
not a beautiful map sheet.</i>

594
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,240
<i>Idiotic orders had been carried
out. But they found nothing.</i>

595
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,640
<i>Zhora knew Severstroi did not
believe in objective difficulties.</i>

596
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,840
<i>So he would be responsible
for the gaps on the map.</i>

597
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,920
<i>The project had been virtually ruined,
and there was nothing to replace it.</i>

598
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,280
Attention! The chiefs are coming!

599
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:46,600
I'm a tin man
my job is to deal with cassiterite.

600
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,640
The issue of the mine has been approved.

601
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,600
It won't be, Vladimir Mikhailovich.

602
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,880
I won't give you a leave,
nor the tin-mines.

603
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,360
I need you here.

604
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,280
I offer you to take charge
of the prospecting for placer gold.

605
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,240
That's irresponsible, Ilya Nikolaevich.

606
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:13,560
I'm not going to take part
in this wild gamble.

607
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,600
And if it's an order?

608
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,600
For the first time in my life

609
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,040
I shall answer it with a medical note.

610
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,800
Don't force me to do that.

611
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,880
I have chest pains.
I'm flying to Moscow tomorrow.

612
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,280
I'll go to a doctor.

613
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,600
I ask you not to report to Furdetsky
until my return.

614
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,360
Thanks for the cinnabar.

615
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,200
Fine, I will wait until you're back.

616
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,720
Vladimir Semenovich,

617
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,400
thank you.

618
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,880
Onward, Jupiter's favorites.

619
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:58,480
Hold on, guys.
If the samples fall overboard,

620
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:03,080
the chief hasn't got enough cartridges
to shoot us all.

621
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,320
<i>Gurin wasn't with Apryatin.</i>

622
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,400
<i>He was doing a common friendly duty.</i>

623
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,480
<i>Burying the geologist's remains.</i>

624
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,000
<i>Then he was going solo
to the ocean, to Whaler Cape,</i>

625
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,240
<i>where Eskimo boats
were to pick everybody up.</i>

626
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,240
Hello, people!

627
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,000
All of the party are assembled.

628
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,880
Finished the route
without a single corpse.

629
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,760
Who said we couldn't do it?

630
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,520
We can! By God, we can!

631
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,320
Let's drink to the end of the season.

632
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,360
Chief! We'd drown for you, if needed.

633
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,640
Drink with us, Doctor. You're strong.

634
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,720
And your Chinkov is strong too.

635
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,280
But where would you be without us workers?

636
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:58,000
With your permission, Chief,
I'll drink later. In solitude.

637
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:10,600
In Central Asia, I climbed three days
to that one almost inaccessible pass.

638
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,440
Why? To drink fifty grams of cognac,

639
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:24,120
to look down upon the world,
and think about the transience of life.

640
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,520
Why did I do it?

641
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,480
The answer is simple.

642
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,160
The folly of the ages.

643
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,520
The desire to prove at all costs
my singularity:

644
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,720
I'm not like everyone else!

645
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,120
You'll perish.

646
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,600
What are you talking about?

647
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,160
Nothing. It's marked on your face.

648
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:59,640
Nonsense.
The main thing is to keep your distance.

649
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,360
The main rule of navigation
in crowded places.

650
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,600
That's the secret…

651
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,840
The boats are coming.

652
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,240
<i>According to an unwritten law
of Severstroi</i>

653
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:23,480
<i>a geologist returning from the field
was entitled to three days.</i>

654
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,800
<i>By the same unwritten law,
he was expected to report</i>

655
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,160
<i>to the Survey building at 9 a.m.</i>

656
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,920
<i>clean-shaven, decently dressed,
and perfectly sober.</i>

657
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,080
How do you do, woman.

658
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,480
Come in.

659
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,680
Are you going to live here?
Where's Baklakov?

660
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,400
Baklakov.

661
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,160
Baklakov…

662
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,920
departed for his family estate
in the village.

663
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,720
Is he your friend?

664
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,680
I don't have friends. I have buddies,
like everyone in our time.

665
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:12,560
I'm rooming with Baklakov
because it's convenient.

666
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,200
He's a simple soul. Occupied
with body building and geology.

667
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,120
He doesn't talk
about the divine. Or women.

668
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,840
He's probably very good.

669
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:26,240
Charming. Our simple Soviet fanatic.

670
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,920
And you?

671
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,120
A penultimate adventurer.

672
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,240
Why penultimate?

673
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,400
It'd be a pity if I were the last. Cognac?

674
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,560
Cognac.

675
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:51,280
Cognac requires gold-plated glasses.

676
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,320
Only then there is color.

677
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:03,760
-Where do you get this cognac from?
-Acquaintances.

678
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,960
They send books, drinks, and records.

679
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:13,640
They do their best to keep me
up with the times.

680
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,080
I smoke cigars like Churchill.

681
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,080
I'd like to live to a ripe old age.
To see how it all ends.

682
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,400
What exactly? Excuse me,
if this sounds like an interview.

683
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,080
What exactly?

684
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,240
You're a journalist? My respects.

685
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,600
How what ends?

686
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:43,280
The universal hysteria
for apartments, clothes, and cars.

687
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,520
Consumers are taking over the world.
And to hell with them!

688
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,800
I propose a toast to your career.

689
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:51,840
Let's.

690
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:01,720
I can draw up a template
for any correspondence on this.

691
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,440
Go on.

692
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:09,320
Leather torbasa boots, blizzard,

693
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,160
enthusiasm, snowy expanses,

694
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,880
youthful fervor, the old nomad.

695
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,880
You don't need to ham it up.
That's my job.

696
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,280
I respect that. I respect work.

697
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,000
And my neighbor
and colleague Baklakov respects it.

698
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,280
We all respect work.

699
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,080
What a type you are…

700
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:34,800
I'm not a type. I'm singular.
A wanderer - that's who I am.

701
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,080
How do you manage to be a wanderer?

702
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,960
I have a PhD,

703
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,480
but I know my field
on the level of an average professor.

704
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,640
I speak two languages. It makes me
a welcome guest everywhere.

705
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,040
When I get tired,

706
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:53,160
I'll choose a spot on the map
and move there.

707
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,880
Moving allows me to not own things.

708
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,640
It's easier.

709
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,920
-You don't find it an empty life?
-Sad.

710
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:14,000
Previously Genghis Khan, Tamerlane,
and Alexander conquered the world.

711
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,920
Now it's inexorably
being taken over by consumers.

712
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:20,760
Everywhere.

713
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:26,360
From Lake Titicaca to Mozhaisk.
The most ruthless conquest.

714
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,080
So I love adventurers.

715
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:32,840
Consumers have outlawed them.
So I have adapted.

716
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,320
I try to maintain myself
in this universal craze.

717
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,080
To have nothing, except myself.

718
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,840
What an amazing guy!

719
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:49,240
Amazing guys sit in cafes,
sip port wine through straws

720
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,240
and pretend to be playboys.

721
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,280
No, I'm the penultimate adventurer…

722
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,120
I am on par with these Arctic supermen.

723
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:01,480
-By the way, do you want to see them?
-I do. And how?

724
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,880
The Field Workers' Night.

725
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:08,360
Just the heroes of tundra and a bottle
of wine, no outsiders allowed.

726
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,320
A treasure.

727
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:16,600
-So, are you going to invite me?
-To the Field Workers' Night?

728
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,880
I'm a complicated man, but accessible.

729
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,480
You're not so complicated.

730
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:47,680
You know, Ivan Egorovich,

731
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,600
it's a deposit of global impact.

732
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,920
MOSCOW, MINISTRY OF THE GEOLOGY

733
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,760
Mongolov insists that the
entire mountain is made of cinnabar.

734
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,760
We took a ton of it.

735
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,680
Just walked over,
picked it up, and transported it.

736
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,800
Is this the reason you flew to Moscow?

737
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,840
Robykin has called twice.

738
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,120
So you don't believe it?

739
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,760
What's this?

740
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,720
Take a look.

741
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,080
It's the gold that's not there.

742
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,480
Did you pan it? Coarse fraction…

743
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:49,240
What do you want, Ilya?

744
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:56,320
Money. Lots of money. And more money.

745
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,640
Are you here in secret?

746
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,640
Yes. And I mined the gold in secret.

747
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,240
This isn't easy, as it was on the river.

748
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:22,680
There is a sinking alluvial deposit. We
need a major survey.

749
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,520
With money we will provide a new deposit.

750
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,840
You want another State Prize, do you?

751
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:43,280
One more prize is quite good of course.

752
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,640
But you know, Ivan,

753
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:50,760
I want to tell myself I'm
not ashamed of my life

754
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,640
before I die of the third heart attack.

755
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,840
To say I did almost everything
what I was intended for.

756
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,880
Or at least that I tried to do it. Yes?

757
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,960
Why did you take cognac out?
For show, or what?

758
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,160
<i>Where has Chinkov disappeared to?</i>

759
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,560
<i>It's the second day
I can't reach him. Over.</i>

760
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:28,200
The ATVs you've sent have proved
perfect for the Arctic terrain.

761
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:33,720
The workers asked to thank you,
Comrade Robykin. Over.

762
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,680
<i>Where's Chinkov? Over.</i>

763
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,480
He flew to a hospital
due to a heart condition.

764
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:49,080
All the field parties returned safely,
Comrade Robykin. Over.

765
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,600
<i>What do you think,
you don't answer to anyone? Over.</i>

766
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:02,040
How can we, Comrade Robykin.

767
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,760
I'll send a preliminary report
to you personally in a week. Over.

768
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:14,280
<i>I wish the Survey team
every success. Over and out.</i>

769
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:22,520
<i>Baklakov was late. His father died
three days before his arrival.</i>

770
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,000
<i>He gave out all of father's good things.</i>

771
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,040
<i>He took only
a big album with family photos.</i>

772
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:32,240
<i>Baklakov realized with irrefutable
clarity that from now on</i>

773
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,120
<i>the only thing he had</i>

774
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:38,840
<i>was a room on the Arctic Ocean shore,
and that the Territory was his home.</i>

775
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:52,160
So long. Read Ramberg.
It will be good for you.

776
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,440
Andrey, let's talk.

777
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,440
Problems with the report?

778
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,600
Almost.

779
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,920
The logic is simple.

780
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,520
Your position isn't lamentable,
but delightful,

781
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:11,200
because you have the option
to write a custom report.

782
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,000
I'll be serious.

783
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:16,240
Have you ever read the classic reports?

784
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,960
Mushketov? Obruchev?

785
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,120
Bogdanovich? No?

786
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,920
So much for years of study.

787
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:28,120
The old classics wrote geological novels,

788
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:33,040
they wrote essays about the individual
variants of their hypotheses.

789
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:36,520
They put time into
describing the landscape so

790
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:40,720
that you shared their frame of mind,
their way of thinking.

791
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,400
And what about
the Mineral Deposits section?

792
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:48,600
You're nothing if not stubborn.

793
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:53,720
I suggest you write a geological sketch.
Uninhibited mind play.

794
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:57,720
Your personal perspective
on the structure the earth

795
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,560
based on our area.

796
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:04,560
The mineral deposits
will take care of themselves.

797
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:09,440
Try to understand
why Buddha is eager for gold.

798
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:14,920
Bear in mind that Buddha
doesn't take a step without a reason.

799
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,360
He is the only intelligent person
among you supermen.

800
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,760
Stop teasing.

801
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:26,640
If I see the sacred fire
of a thought process in your eyes,

802
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,600
I'll work on petrography section.

803
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,720
OK.

804
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
By the way,

805
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:39,120
I lost a bet for a dozen
bottles of champagne.

806
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:42,040
So do drop by our lovely friend tonight.

807
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,520
No, I'll be working.

808
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:49,360
-Well as you wish.
-Maybe I'll drop by after nine.

809
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:54,480
<i>Baklakov spent the entire week
in the Survey working on the report.</i>

810
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:58,160
<i>The flat colored sheet of paper</i>

811
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,600
<i>contained a four-dimensional world of</i>

812
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,600
<i>correlations of bed dislocations,</i>

813
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:06,640
<i>fractures in the earth's crust,
deep-down explosions of magma,</i>

814
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,880
<i>the violent madness of volcanic eruptions.</i>

815
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:13,240
<i>The violet field of the Triassic.</i>

816
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,040
<i>A presumed Paleozoic massif in the east.</i>

817
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,160
<i>To the south, a green line</i>

818
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,800
<i>showed the effusives of the
Ketung Plateau.</i>

819
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:27,040
<i>He must first get a historical picture.</i>

820
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:31,920
<i>Faults. For some reason his thoughts
kept returning to the faults.</i>

821
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,680
<i>The mountain passes followed them,
the river valleys,</i>

822
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:39,120
<i>the fault escarpments.</i>

823
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:43,240
<i>It was here that the magma
broke through, they formed the relief.</i>

824
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,360
<i>Why pay so much attention to faults?</i>

825
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,560
<i>Suddenly he thought it was</i>

826
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:52,280
<i>no use burying himself in all those facts.</i>

827
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,760
<i>Or hiding behind small details.</i>

828
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,240
<i>A prophet's power lies in moral certainty.</i>

829
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:02,640
<i>He had to lay a foundation.
The details could come later.</i>

830
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:08,760
<i>There was gold here - the ubiquitous
traces proved that for a fact.</i>

831
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:13,120
<i>The granites brought it.
That was also a fact.</i>

832
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,760
<i>But in these massifs
no one had ever seen lore gold.</i>

833
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:19,840
<i>That was the third fact.</i>

834
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:28,280
<i>Baklakov took a sheet of paper and a pen</i>

835
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,880
<i>and suddenly,
instead of all the questions,</i>

836
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,520
<i>he started writing a letter.</i>

837
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:36,280
<i>It was a silly one about a
friend of his who had tried</i>

838
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:40,080
<i>to get a light from the Aurora Borealis
with a magnifying glass,</i>

839
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:45,080
<i>about a cockroach called Syoma
that lived in a crack over his bed.</i>

840
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:49,120
<i>While he was writing,
he understood absolutely clearly</i>

841
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:54,280
<i>that there was a special type of granite,
as of yet unknown.</i>

842
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,200
<i>In such a case, gold deposits
should be expected</i>

843
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,280
<i>in all rivers of the Territory.</i>

844
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,800
<i>That night he got the main thing.</i>

845
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,040
<i>Intuition and confidence.</i>

846
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,800
<i>He knew he was right.</i>

847
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,840
-Good morning.
-Morning!

848
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:25,280
You disappeared.
Why don't you stop by anymore?

849
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,120
Gurin wrote some notes,
asked me to give them to you.

850
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:35,120
He's been living with me,
working on his report.

851
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,400
You're rather cheerful and shiny,

852
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:42,640
full of color.

853
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,160
Who is Tamara?

854
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:48,360
Tamara!

855
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,960
Today I had a good night.

856
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:07,120
I was suddenly filled with the joy
of the coming summer.

857
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,400
Mongolov says
I reduced the amount of evil on earth.

858
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:18,720
My God. Under the influence of Gurin,
you'll soon become a philosopher.

859
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,080
You don't have to be one.
You're just a simple superman.

860
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,960
They should write about you.

861
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,920
Go to the tundra, meet the people.

862
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,640
Mongolov has such people,
more like screws.

863
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:33,520
They can be neither hammered in,
nor pulled out.

864
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,800
Write about them.

865
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:39,800
These people of yours, these screws,

866
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:42,800
we can't write about them.

867
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:47,720
We need those who come here for the
romance of it, and have clean pasts…

868
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,960
I'm a bad journalist,
I can't write any other way.

869
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,960
Yes, they're not smooth, or clean.

870
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:58,600
They're the first here, where
others will flock to for romance.

871
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:02,240
Maybe there will be a city here.
Maybe more than one.

872
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,160
But a city needs a foundation.

873
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,760
You need a hard worker nicknamed Kefir.

874
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,960
He isn't holy.

875
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:13,440
But hard work goes hand in hand
with Kefir, they are one.

876
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:16,600
Maybe this is his holiness.

877
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:22,120
You know, your duty
is to be a very good person.

878
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,360
Why?

879
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:30,040
Some people have it harder than others.

880
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:34,360
Others get away with things,
but they can't.

881
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,520
They have an obligation to be better.

882
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:40,520
If they decide to chase their
dreams, they are doubly obligated.

883
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:41,760
Why?

884
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,360
Most of us are scared to chase our dreams.

885
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:51,640
MOUTH OF THE ELGAI RIVER,
EASTERN SURVEY AREA

886
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:59,440
Bosses think that a worker
just took his up-front wages,

887
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:05,600
found himself some rotgut,
well, they call it port wine,

888
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:08,000
and sleeps it off somewhere.

889
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:15,280
But the management spends
sleepless nights,

890
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:19,720
takes pills and drops for this and that.

891
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:25,160
If they go to sleep,
the whole project will collapse.

892
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:29,960
But what is production, Gray?

893
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:31,520
Right!

894
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,160
It's a tree!

895
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:39,480
And the workers grow it.

896
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:46,000
When the bosses fall asleep,
the workers take a rest.

897
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:04,040
We can do it, lads!

898
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,080
We can do it!

899
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:17,520
-Is there any more?
-You've got a lucky eye, come down.

900
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,000
Toilers!

901
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,880
Salute with your right hand.

902
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:29,160
When you hear "March,"
begin with your right foot.

903
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,280
Anti-aircraft guns shoot up.

904
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,480
The boys did not beat the air.
Worked really hard.

905
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,240
Here you are, Vladimir Mikhailovich!

906
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:48,920
Where?

907
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,800
Line four hundred thirty, pit eight.

908
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:02,520
At ten meters.

909
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:08,200
Want some liquor?

910
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,600
Can't have that.

911
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:15,560
It'll scare luck away.
It's the law of prospectors.

912
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:19,360
Kefir!

913
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:25,960
Start the boiler.
We need to sluice. Winter sluicing.

914
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:30,000
Now we can't wait until summer…

915
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,080
<i>Sluicing at the lower line was empty.</i>

916
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:41,600
<i>The sands turned out to be barren.</i>

917
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:47,960
<i>Mongolov ordered
the boiler be taken to the next line.</i>

918
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,080
<i>The second line was also barren.</i>

919
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:53,560
<i>The painful spirit of failure
overcame the party.</i>

920
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:11,480
<i>Where's the logic, Mongolov thought,</i>

921
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:14,840
<i>A nugget the size of an egg
was not just a trace.</i>

922
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:17,000
<i>It couldn't be an accident.</i>

923
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:21,080
<i>But the gold industry didn't live
off nuggets.</i>

924
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:23,680
<i>What kept it going was
gold grains and dust.</i>

925
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,800
<i>Grains and dust would have to be panned.</i>

926
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,320
<i>Mongolov was getting excited.</i>

927
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,120
<i>He understood
that the Chief Engineer's plans</i>

928
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,440
<i>must extend much further than Elgai.</i>

929
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,800
I read your report, Sergey Aleksandrovich.

930
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:52,080
Your reasoning makes perfect sense.

931
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,640
I propose you plan the route

932
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:01,720
and plan a circumferential party.

933
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,000
You will head it.

934
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:09,800
You'll follow the boundaries
of the Survey grounds

935
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:12,240
and write a report estimating the

936
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:17,080
the Territory's gold-bearing potential.
I will be co-author.

937
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:23,880
I'll give you Kutsenko as a sluicer.
Take Gurin as your instrument man.

938
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,720
I don't want Gurin. Personal reasons.

939
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:32,400
In the Elgai Valley traps for deposits
should be

940
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:35,280
as you described in your report.

941
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:42,120
You guessed it. I believe you
guessed it for the entire Territory.

942
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:46,440
This is the most complicated
and important party.

943
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,760
I need the plan in a week.

944
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:05,560
Remember, no matter how complicated and
long the route you plan,

945
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:08,120
it still won't be enough.

946
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:11,720
As soon as you're clear about the route,

947
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:14,720
take an airplane and drop food stores.

948
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:19,280
Only you will be responsible
for the party's results.

949
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:23,120
I don't care what you need to do
to carry it out.

950
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,520
That's my concern.

951
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:32,720
Your concern is to keep your brain hot,
to develop ideas

952
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:36,080
and then adjust them according
to the reality.

953
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:39,240
In common parlance, it's called wisdom.

954
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:42,360
I oblige you to be relentless and wise

955
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:44,960
in everything that's about the gold here.

956
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:49,760
Your future depends
entirely on this summer.

957
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:52,880
I wish you luck.

958
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,720
And don't disappoint me.
I believe in your strength.

959
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,240
Salakhov, find me
a good place for the camp.

960
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:18,800
Food stuffs on a second flight.
Let's load the detonators.

961
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:24,160
Chief! There's still space.
We can take grub.

962
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:26,240
It'll go on the second flight.

963
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,720
It's strictly forbidden to transport
explosives

964
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:33,080
and detonators in the same transport.
I'm accountable.

965
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,360
Let me fly!

966
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:45,000
Are you new here, Chief?
Take an airplane for a donkey?

967
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:47,400
Load whatever on a donkey.

968
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:49,280
Enough. Finish loading.

969
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:50,640
Finishing.

970
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,680
-What's that?
-Grub.

971
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:00,920
Stuff happens. Last year
I spent two weeks waiting for a plane…

972
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,240
You're not going to eat, but to work.

973
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:13,560
<i>The plane took off, came back
as scheduled, but that was it.</i>

974
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:15,520
<i>A blizzard set in.</i>

975
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,040
Stop!

976
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:22,160
<i>The first fine day with a good forecast
happened to be seven days later.</i>

977
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:24,680
<i>At the airfield Apryatin learned</i>

978
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:28,800
<i>that Baklakov had grabbed
the only available "Annushka".</i>

979
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,120
<i>The only thing Apryatin could do
was to pray</i>

980
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:35,560
<i>for Baklakov not to smash the plane
on his idiotic tour</i>

981
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:38,680
<i>and for those two to endure the waiting.</i>

982
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:41,160
<i>Salakhov and the God of Fire had no food.</i>

983
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,760
<i>Apryatin told nobody about it,</i>

984
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:47,240
<i>though he knew
that if Salakhov and the God of Fire died</i>

985
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:49,480
<i>he would have to shoot himself.</i>

986
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:57,320
<i>Six drums with food
and one containing rubber boats</i>

987
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:00,840
<i>to drop along Baklakov's
forthcoming heroic route</i>

988
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:05,440
<i>were filled, wired
and delivered to the plane.</i>

989
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:08,080
<i>Baklakov had transferred all the drop</i>

990
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:14,040
<i>points to the pilot's navigating map.</i>

991
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:18,880
<i>A week before that
Kutsenko flew away by post plane.</i>

992
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,520
<i>He had either to rent or buy a whaleboat,</i>

993
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,600
<i>deliver it by tractor
to the mouth of the Grey River</i>

994
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:27,200
<i>and to preserve a base there.</i>

995
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,120
So we land,

996
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:33,480
pick up your Kutsenko,
and immediately take off. Nuts.

997
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:37,920
On this damn cape you never know
if there's wind or not.

998
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:41,880
Hello! Cape Banners!

999
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:45,920
Ground control! Senya! Lazy bum!

1000
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,320
At least put long johns on the pole.

1001
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:54,080
Do it the old way. Light a fire
I'll circle once more.

1002
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:35,400
Engineer,

1003
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:42,400
The craft with your colleague
had an accident on Cape Banners.

1004
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:45,760
Everyone's alive.
They don't know when it can be fixed.

1005
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,320
You can stop hanging out here.

1006
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:04,960
Patient!

1007
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:07,880
You have a visitor.

1008
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,880
Come in.

1009
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:24,320
We have lights out at eleven.
I'll bring you an oil lamp then.

1010
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:30,040
Well, go on, chat.

1011
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,680
How did you know?

1012
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:53,280
Tamara, when you turn eighteen,
will you marry me?

1013
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,960
Next year. I will.

1014
01:44:57,160 --> 01:45:02,560
You're kind and strong,
although completely ugly right now.

1015
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:39,680
What are you waiting for?

1016
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:45,040
There was bad weather.
Now there's no airplane.

1017
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:50,760
I've thought a lot about you, Apryatin.

1018
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:53,520
Your grandfather asked.

1019
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:57,480
But if your people died -
I'll put you on trial.

1020
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:16,280
Go to the radio and send a message
in my name to the city

1021
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:20,320
that we urgently need
an AN-2 ambulance on skis.

1022
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,880
Do you believe in God, Apryatin?

1023
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,680
I'm a Komsomol member!

1024
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:34,200
I've been praying for days.

1025
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:42,880
Pray, Apryatin, pray.

1026
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:07,560
Salakhov, you won't swallow me, will you?

1027
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:11,400
What took you so long, Chief?

1028
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:26,440
…those were our granddads!

1029
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:30,640
-Well?
-Katinsky died. Mikhail Arkadievich.

1030
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:32,120
Hush!

1031
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,400
Katinsky died.

1032
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,560
Mikhail Katinsky

1033
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:06,520
saw the world from the wondrous
heights of high moral truths.

1034
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:09,000
And we?

1035
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:15,080
We live and die. It's a shame.

1036
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:18,920
There is much evil in the world.

1037
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:25,720
So, our main and common task

1038
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:29,440
and our personal quest
is to get rid of it.

1039
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:36,400
During the war it was clear -
take up a sword or gun.

1040
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:41,480
But in peacetime,

1041
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:49,760
honest work should be the elimination
of our universal evil.

1042
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:54,560
That's the higher purpose.

1043
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,560
What's the probability that Vasya the Cat

1044
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:19,000
poking his paw wherever he likes,

1045
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:22,160
will be able to type
"The tale about Tzar Saltan"?

1046
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:25,160
One in three billion.

1047
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:28,600
The possibility of your going
with me to the field

1048
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:31,360
is within this probability.

1049
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:36,680
And no editorial tasks will help.

1050
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:42,880
There's cold there which isn't possible
to escape, dirt, obscene lexicon.

1051
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,800
Finally, sometimes there's no food.

1052
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:51,080
I can't.

1053
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:02,880
Enough moping.
Look at the world in a different way.

1054
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,240
Do something useful.

1055
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:10,960
Write a novel. About us. About supermen.

1056
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:14,320
Here's the first line.

1057
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:19,000
"Two beach mariners stand
by the Arctic Ocean,

1058
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:22,480
watching the sunset and the melting ice."

1059
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:24,360
Enough. Go.

1060
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:38,440
<i>Loving you is so exciting,</i>

1061
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:41,480
<i>Just as diving amidst ice.</i>

1062
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,720
<i>Loving you is just as pointless</i>

1063
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:49,640
<i>As trying to stop the flow of time.</i>

1064
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:54,080
<i>Loving you is just as useless</i>

1065
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:57,280
<i>As attempts to catch the wind</i>

1066
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:01,560
<i>Loving you is just as hopeless</i>

1067
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:04,520
<i>As to count on cliffs' will</i>

1068
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:08,400
<i>Loving you means there's no other.</i>

1069
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:11,240
<i>There's no fate that can be better…</i>

1070
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,640
<i>To ache in secret, ache forever,</i>

1071
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:17,800
<i>To howl with wolves in desperation</i>

1072
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:21,560
<i>Loving you is gulping water</i>

1073
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:24,040
<i>In the desert without relief,</i>

1074
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,640
<i>To be cast aside one day</i>

1075
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:30,120
<i>In submission to your whim.</i>

1076
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,800
<i>Loving you is to swim the ocean</i>

1077
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,800
<i>Where waves deliver backhand blows</i>

1078
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:41,520
<i>Loving you is truly precious</i>

1079
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,440
<i>A luxury I can't afford.</i>

1080
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:47,440
<i>Loving you holds as much perils</i>

1081
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:50,440
<i>As slipping on a cliff's rough edge</i>

1082
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:54,960
<i>But oh my God, you are so perfect</i>

1083
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:58,640
<i>That this love I can't escape.</i>

1084
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:04,160
THE NGANAI HILLS, SURVEY PARTY

1085
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:34,800
Welcome, Chief!

1086
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,600
Wow, mountain skis!

1087
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:45,120
Sure thing.

1088
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,600
King of the Kavgolov Hills, that's me.

1089
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:50,240
Have you been to the south?

1090
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:55,680
Certainly, Chief. There's a rock
intrusion over there.

1091
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,880
Maybe just the tip
of non-discharged magma.

1092
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:07,840
Wonderful contact.
A ready-made laboratory.

1093
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:11,440
But… It needs stripping.

1094
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:17,440
Chief, I'm awaiting wise, guiding words.

1095
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:21,320
Study all the details.

1096
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:25,280
Take Gray, he's trained in mining.

1097
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:29,160
And drop these. You'll be worn out.

1098
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:33,080
THE VALLEY OF THREE GLACIERS

1099
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:36,240
<i>Mongolov took away his new wife</i>

1100
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,440
<i>to the camp in the same plane.</i>

1101
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:42,960
<i>In a few days she would be taken back
by Uncle Kostya.</i>

1102
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:57,440
Good morning.

1103
01:55:57,520 --> 01:55:59,080
Good morning.

1104
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:01,920
Are you cold?

1105
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:05,200
Nope.

1106
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:08,560
See, nothing to be afraid of!

1107
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:37,360
Coffee?

1108
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:41,440
Well, certainly not like that in Vienna.

1109
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:43,560
But coffee…

1110
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:03,400
<i>My God, I grew up in Sokolniki in Moscow.</i>

1111
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:06,960
<i>By the age of ten
I knew everything about mankind.</i>

1112
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:13,280
<i>And I saw happy people.</i>

1113
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:30,240
<i>If for every stray there can't be found</i>

1114
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:34,320
<i>a strong clever person,
then mankind is not worth a pin.</i>

1115
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:38,160
<i>But mankind is worth something.</i>

1116
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:44,480
<i>Fishes. Where do they swim?</i>

1117
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:49,360
<i>It's dark in the water,
and they do not know where to swim.</i>

1118
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:55,920
<i>We should light up fires for them,
so they would know where to go.</i>

1119
01:57:57,320 --> 01:58:00,920
<i>Because nobody should live in darkness!</i>

1120
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,680
<i>Light up the fires in the ocean!</i>

1121
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:31,000
<i>Uncle Kostya was wounded
in February of 1945</i>

1122
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:32,840
<i>in the battle for Budapest.</i>

1123
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:34,600
<i>Missile wounds.</i>

1124
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:37,120
<i>Fine splinters stuck the ribs,</i>

1125
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:40,480
<i>a bigger one broke the rib
and stopped near the heart.</i>

1126
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,760
<i>It didn't disturb him.</i>

1127
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:46,720
<i>It only moved slightly
during moments of excitement.</i>

1128
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:39,400
Listen to me! Don't be afraid.

1129
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:43,480
They'll look for us. They will find you.

1130
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:57,400
Survive, will you?

1131
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:52,920
Tractor drivers are forbidden

1132
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:57,760
to leave without a tent,
a kerosene stove, a sleeping bag

1133
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,960
and a week's supply of food.

1134
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:03,240
Geologists-surveyors must not do…

1135
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:29,520
I have finished.

1136
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:38,120
Sergey Aleksandrovich!

1137
02:01:39,480 --> 02:01:41,000
Gurin broke his legs.

1138
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:44,720
-How?!
-On those contraptions of his.

1139
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:47,240
The skis broke to smithereens,

1140
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:51,440
both legs are broken. His spine seems
intact. We need to go.

1141
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:53,640
Arctic foxes, they'll eat him.

1142
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:55,880
-And the gun?
-I took the gun.

1143
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:58,600
Gurin is bad. Yelling, crying.

1144
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:03,280
I've sent Gray to sleep.
We have to leave in two hours.

1145
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:52,400
<i>At that moment Baklakov hated Gurin.</i>

1146
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:57,080
<i>He decided: he must go
to the radio station himself.</i>

1147
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:01,200
<i>He'd make 170 kilometers in two days.</i>

1148
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:04,000
<i>He'll save his roommate's legs.</i>

1149
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:12,760
THE VALLEY OF THE SMALL KITAM RIVER

1150
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:17,840
<i>As always, after making the decision
Baklakov felt better</i>

1151
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:21,000
<i>and now he began to be sorry for Gurin.</i>

1152
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:24,240
<i>If Gurin lost his legs,
it'd be the end of him.</i>

1153
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:27,760
<i>He was not the kind of person
to live as a cripple.</i>

1154
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:49,640
Kyaye!

1155
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:53,840
-God sent you to me again!
-Have you forgotten?

1156
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:57,920
When you went to the airplane,
we made an agreement.

1157
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:00,320
I brought everything.

1158
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:02,720
Left at the base.

1159
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:07,320
-My engineer broke his legs.
-I know.

1160
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:10,440
They told me at your base.

1161
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:12,920
There is a weather station

1162
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:15,240
170 kilometers from here.

1163
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:18,320
They can call for a plane.

1164
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:20,640
I'll take him.

1165
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:36,840
THE VALLEY OF THE SMALL KITAM RIVER

1166
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:43,120
<i>Gurin saw himself clearly from the side</i>

1167
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:48,600
<i>as a mass of actions, words,
accidents and objective facts.</i>

1168
02:07:49,640 --> 02:07:53,440
<i>His own and other people's aphorisms,
his proud aloofness.</i>

1169
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:59,320
<i>Andrey Gurin, top-grade expert and
individualist philosopher.</i>

1170
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:03,560
<i>And now he was now lying helpless</i>

1171
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:05,960
<i>in a stupid valley of a stupid river,</i>

1172
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:10,480
<i>and an illiterate herdsman was driving
his reindeer to death to save him.</i>

1173
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:34,040
<i>Now, Baklakov needed to</i>

1174
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:37,640
<i>coordinate the borders
with Zhora Apryatin's route</i>

1175
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:40,160
<i>and to work methodically, steadily,</i>

1176
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:43,560
<i>to work every minute without rest,</i>

1177
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:46,120
<i>but to get through this double summer.</i>

1178
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:47,680
THE MARAU HILLS

1179
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:54,560
I go for two days. Wait for Apryatin.

1180
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:31,640
<i>We are all doomed here.
We are all doomed to our work.</i>

1181
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:35,360
<i>Saints in the wilderness
and faithful wives,</i>

1182
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:39,640
<i>beautiful women and millionaires,
all are doomed to their role in life.</i>

1183
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:41,880
<i>We are doomed to work,</i>

1184
02:12:41,960 --> 02:12:46,400
<i>and this is the best and highest kind
of doom in the world.</i>

1185
02:12:58,640 --> 02:12:59,480
Gray!

1186
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:24,280
The plans have changed. We've found gold.

1187
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:34,960
Let's wait for Apryatin,
and get back to the base.

1188
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:52,920
Hey! Where are you going to?

1189
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:04,880
Sergey!

1190
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,720
Welcome!

1191
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:57,960
Well, Vladimir Mikhailovich,
you'll get money and additional workers.

1192
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:02,400
But Robykin keeps fighting
to closing the Survey.

1193
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:07,080
They want to set up an expanded
search party for tin instead of us.

1194
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:09,360
They want you to head it.

1195
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:13,400
Tangled knots must be cut immediately.

1196
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:18,040
I will continue searching for gold.

1197
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:20,680
Use my experience as a mining engineer.

1198
02:17:21,960 --> 02:17:27,560
I know the Territory has gold.
And I know that we will find it.

1199
02:19:18,680 --> 02:19:20,480
Good morning, comrade Chief!

1200
02:19:21,240 --> 02:19:23,840
Ah! Profound moderation of alcohol.

1201
02:19:25,680 --> 02:19:28,360
He was the one
who found the 350-gram nugget.

1202
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:30,440
Is it really such a feat, Sir?

1203
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:32,840
I gave up the booze to keep our luck!

1204
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:36,280
And maintain the strength
of the national currency.

1205
02:19:36,360 --> 02:19:39,960
Gigolov heroically refused
the alcohol he was offered.

1206
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:42,280
-Wasn't that the case?
-Yes.

1207
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:47,840
That's a lush fur-coat you have.
Just right for walking down Broadway.

1208
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:50,080
-All the chicks'll be yours!

1209
02:19:56,200 --> 02:19:59,000
The first human flight in space!

1210
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:03,440
Our soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin in space!

1211
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:05,720
Hurrah, comrades! Hurrah!

1212
02:20:05,800 --> 02:20:08,440
Hurrah!

1213
02:20:11,160 --> 02:20:14,720
<i>We are now transmitting the message
about the first human</i>

1214
02:20:15,560 --> 02:20:18,200
<i>into space!</i>

1215
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:22,840
<i>It's April 12th, 1961.</i>

1216
02:20:23,720 --> 02:20:28,360
<i>A Soviet astronaut reached</i>

1217
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:33,400
<i>the orbit of the earth</i>

1218
02:20:33,480 --> 02:20:37,640
<i>for the first time in history.</i>

1219
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:21,440
<i>Chinkov's prevision was fulfilled.</i>

1220
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:25,880
<i>They discovered
the Territory's gold-bearing node.</i>

1221
02:23:25,960 --> 02:23:29,880
<i>All this happened
in another century and in another world.</i>

1222
02:23:40,840 --> 02:23:42,440
<i>If there were a higher power</i>

1223
02:23:42,520 --> 02:23:45,800
<i>that could bring back everyone
related to this story</i>

1224
02:23:45,880 --> 02:23:49,240
<i>who died on the route
or lost their way on the continent,</i>

1225
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:51,520
<i>they would've done it all over again.</i>

1226
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:53,080
<i>Not for the sake of money,</i>

1227
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:57,200
<i>they'd learned the true worth
of it in the Territory.</i>

1228
02:23:57,680 --> 02:23:59,280
<i>And not in the name of duty,</i>

1229
02:23:59,360 --> 02:24:03,440
<i>one's true duty lies within,
rather than in words.</i>

1230
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:04,960
<i>And not for glory.</i>

1231
02:24:05,960 --> 02:24:07,920
<i>But for the sake of the unknown,</i>

1232
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:12,040
<i>which is the beginning and the drive
of any person's life</i>

1233
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:17,680
<i>Maybe it's all about being supported
by the thought of those past years,</i>

1234
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:19,680
<i>when you didn't choose the easy way,</i>

1235
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:22,440
<i>when you saw the hard
and beautiful reality,</i>

1236
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:25,320
<i>and lived as a man, a human, should live.</i>

1237
02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:29,680
<i>Today is the consequence of yesterday.</i>

1238
02:24:30,680 --> 02:24:33,640
<i>And all of our tomorrows
are born of our todays.</i>

1239
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:36,760
<i>Then why weren't you
on those tractor sledges?</i>

1240
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:40,600
<i>And why wasn't your face
seared by that frosty February wind?</i>

1241
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:44,120
<i>Where were you? What have you been doing?</i>

1242
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:46,360
<i>Are you proud of your life?</i>

1243
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:52,960
TO OUR PARENTS, WHO DREAMED
OF A PEACEFUL AND HAPPY LIFE
