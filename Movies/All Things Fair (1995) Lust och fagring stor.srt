00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,477
On Mating

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,880
Lectures on Sexuality
by Carolus Linnæus

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:39,080
The discharge of semen generally
begins by the 14th. Year, -

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,836
- when men first indulge in the act
of love, and it continues thereafter -

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:56,072
- until the age of 50 or 60,
when it comes to an end.

8
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,277
And when the semen
starts to flow, -

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:10,480
- the hair round the pleasurable
members grows, the teats swell, -

10
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,840
- the voice changes, etc.

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,239
Both sexes are stirred by Nature -

12
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,356
- towards mating more easily
than before, -

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,792
- when they scarce noted
the difference between each other.

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,913
- The time has come.
- Are you really sure?

15
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,114
- Yes.
- Offenders will be prosecuted.

16
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,440
- I don't care.
- Two centimetres. Check.

17
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,312
- Let's see now.
- We don't have the time.

18
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,120
- Postponed until next recess.
- Postponed until next recess!

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,717
- What is his name?
- Stig.

20
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,878
He's cute.

21
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,669
- He lives in the same building?
- Yes, the same floor.

22
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,952
Mikael Bengtsson.

23
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,437
- Orvar Bergmark.
- Grunt-Orvar.

24
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,554
- What?
- Grunt-Orvar.

25
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,391
It has to be Runt-Orvar to be funny.

26
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,717
Isisdor Blecker.

27
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,711
How long was it?
How long did he say it was?

28
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,550
- Bengt Dahlström.
- How long is it?

29
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,231
Roger Hansson.

30
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,116
Krister Kristensson.

31
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,271
Bo Larsson. Lars Larsson.

32
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,149
Sune Malmberg.

33
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,798
Sture Mårtensson.

34
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,870
Albert Nilsson.

35
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,040
I was class monitor last term.
Can I be monitor now?

36
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,598
Yes, we can keep order
in the class together.

37
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,919
- It will be good.
- Helge Persson.

38
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,594
- Stig Santesson.
- The Stockholmer.

39
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,113
- Are you from Stockholm?
- Yes, I left two years ago.

40
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,633
I am too, I left three days ago.

41
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:27,313
My name is Viola J-son Gryter.
I'll write it on the blackboard.

42
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,000
Some ladies piss
themselves when they come.

43
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,591
What did you say?

44
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,474
They piss when they come.

45
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,794
Why?

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,152
It's like, wide open inside.

47
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,516
Wide open, like a door.

48
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,594
Maybe they just forgot
to go to the toilet before.

49
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,920
Don't you understand anything?
The dick is still inside.

50
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:12,037
- Maybe it's when they come a lot.
- Probably.

51
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,319
I hope we'll get along well
during this spring term.

52
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,958
- You just staying one term, Miss?
- We'll see. Take out your books.

53
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,191
- Show us now, Izzy.
- Use the tape-measure.

54
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,394
It's stuck in his fly.
We don't have all day.

55
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,990
- A full pass.
- Is it two?

56
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,116
- Yeah, he's right.
- There are 28 times 25 pennies.

57
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,119
- That's right.
- Stop, that's cheating.

58
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,712
- Yes, he's a Jew. It doesn't count.
- Doesn't count?

59
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,437
No, they have more hair than us.
It's cheating.

60
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,830
I didn't cheat. Look. It's hair!
What the hell else could it be?

61
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,398
It's not that, Izzy. You're a Jew.

62
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,231
- Christ, sure I'm a Jew, so what?
- It doesn't count.

63
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,511
You've got thicker hair than we have.

64
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,352
Outside the racetrack tote.
If he was a horse.

65
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:38,151
- You didn't say anything before.
- No, but that's how it is now.

66
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,399
Wait Izzy.
You get 25 pennies back.

67
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,116
- What fucking 25 pennies?
- His stake.

68
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:00,078
- He can't compete. He gets it back.
- Why? He knew it from the start.

69
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,035
- What did he know?
- That he's a Jew.

70
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,713
Look in the mirror,
his beak takes up the whole mirror.

71
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,075
But this time we'll let him off.
Give him his 25 pennies.

72
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,115
And you should be damn grateful.

73
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,877
"He came like a storm an April night
and had a tankard round his neck."

74
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,471
Do you know who this was?
His name begins with C.

75
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,469
- Time's up, 5 minutes.
- She looked, I've got 3 left.

76
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,752
Hell no, one at the most.

77
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,351
He is the storm.

78
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,874
- Are you asleep? It's full of flies.
- His name is Carlsson.

79
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,472
- We'll look at the excerpt once more.
- Left.

80
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,153
Thank you for today.

81
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,870
Sit down. Your name is Stig?

82
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,235
The fact that I haven't shouted at you
may persuade you to think -

83
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,710
- that I haven't noticed
your little... eccentricities.

84
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,995
Nothing could be more wrong.
Chewing of the same gum is bad.

85
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,070
It promotes infectious diseases.
The note you passed around...

86
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,354
However, I may allow you
to continue your little speciality.

87
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,954
I've never considered the fly
to be a useful animal.

88
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,837
I don't know how many you've killed,
but I am very impressed.

89
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,431
- I think you missed one.
- Two.

90
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,840
One behind the widow's son
in the picture, and another...

91
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,389
You will stay
and clean up the place of execution.

92
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,392
How? Is water all right,
or should I use a little soap too?

93
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,672
Use your imagination.

94
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,480
- And the note...
- What note?

95
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,800
- The note you passed around.
- I don't know where it is.

96
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,516
Right hip-pocket.

97
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,314
Would you please read it?

98
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,030
I'm all ears.

99
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,320
- I can't do that, Miss.
- Are we no longer able to read?

100
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,073
Yes, but I can't do it, Miss.

101
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,875
"How many times does a cock go
in and out during normal sex?"

102
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,515
"Prize for the right answer."

103
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:54,275
You gentlemen have a rather
exaggerated idea of male potency.

104
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,158
All answers, except perhaps Olle's,
are wishful thinking.

105
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,551
- The flies.
- What?

106
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,231
That one, for instance.

107
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,875
- All bodies removed, Miss.
- That one there.

108
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,159
- Good-bye.
- Good-evening.

109
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,319
Sigge...

110
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,953
Sigge!

111
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,475
- Don't hang your hat on the elk.
- Where is Sigge?

112
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,231
First I heard he had a quick leave,
then Kalle came and said, -

113
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,911
- it was postponed indefinitely.
And I made brown beans.

114
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,478
- Was there a letter?
- Under the mermaid.

115
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,400
Little mermaid.

116
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,753
- Save the batteries, Mum.
<i>- An extra news report.</i>

117
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,116
<i>German forces west of Stalingrad</i>
<i>have suffered severe losses...</i>

118
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,759
He lost a kilogram, but he's still
too fat for welterweight.

119
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,796
- You going to a party?
- Oh, I just felt...

120
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,279
- I wanted to look nice for Sigge.
- How much too fat?

121
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,598
- Two.
- Kilograms or tonnes?

122
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,636
Tonnes. The limit is 67.

123
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,674
Then he should fight Carlström.

124
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,877
- Is that Strong Arvid?
- Yes. Toughest guy in the army.

125
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:43,077
In other words...
Every bite is a safety risk!

126
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,918
"Transfer to submarine service
has not been confirmed."

127
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,831
- Not confirmed...
- Submarines?

128
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,760
He gets panicky in a lift.

129
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,157
I'm just going up to the attic.

130
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,357
- I'm in sort of a hurry.
- You're going to the cinema.

131
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,678
I'm late.

132
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,190
Chocolate, sweets, cream cakes.

133
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:58,112
<i>- Let's take the tables.</i>
<i>- No. Leave them for the museum.</i>

134
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,873
<i>- Help me.</i>
<i>- Do you know this one?</i>

135
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,040
<i>Music, music, music...</i>

136
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,116
A technical problem. You can buy
chocolate while you wait.

137
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,357
We don't want chocolate.

138
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,318
It's 5 minutes late
and then it breaks down.

139
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,720
- And it's not the first time.
- I'll have some chocolate.

140
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,240
- You buying the whole box? Hurry.
- Anyone else...

141
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,229
No. Start the film.

142
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,198
That's the last time I help you.
You have to learn to be on time.

143
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,872
- If Pettersson had shown up...
- It'd be my last coconut ball.

144
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,109
Damn it, I don't want
to lose my job just because...

145
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,233
And put your hat on.

146
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,676
If Pettersson sees you
with no hat on, you'll see stars.

147
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,239
Good boy.

148
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,711
Then they have orgies.

149
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,557
- Orgies?
- I can't hear, what's that?

150
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,549
When a lot do it together.

151
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,959
- A lot do it together?
- Yes.

152
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,600
- Is that the same as group sex?
- What's group sex?

153
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,319
- Same as you said, what is it...?
- Orgies.

154
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,239
- Orgies.
- Quiet!

155
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,958
- He's good around the house too.
- Yes, he is.

156
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,437
- He always empties the garbage.
- And the rugs?

157
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,954
- What?
- Does he help with the rugs too?

158
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,914
Always.

159
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,592
You sit in the window a lot.

160
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:48,071
- God, you know what we forgot?
- Radio language lessons.

161
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,472
<i>- Aasen... Norway.</i>
- That's him.

162
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:06,154
<i>There are a few of us here</i>
<i>round the microphone.</i>

163
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,310
<i>And there are thousands throughout</i>
<i>Scandinavia listening to us.</i>

164
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,073
<i>There are thousands in the whole</i>
<i>of Scandinavia listening to us.</i>

165
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,910
<i>...we here</i>
<i>and you listening to us in Sweden, -</i>

166
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,080
<i>- Denmark, Norway,</i>
<i>Finland and other places.</i>

167
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,671
<i>And you who are here and you</i>
<i>listening to us in Denmark, -</i>

168
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,920
<i>- Sweden, Norway,</i>
<i>Finland and other places...</i>

169
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,512
- What do you think?
- You're improving. You'll do it.

170
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,314
- Sigge.
- Hi.

171
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,718
- How long are you staying?
- Just till tomorrow.

172
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,949
- Did you buy a ticket?
- No, the girl likes the navy.

173
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,030
- She's Danish, right?
- Yes. You on submarines?

174
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,314
I didn't pass the test,
but I'll do it again.

175
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,080
I <i>want</i> to get underwater.

176
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,197
Imagine, just a thin steel skin
between you and the icy water.

177
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,074
Cheek to cheek with death.

178
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,478
Can you think of anything nicer?

179
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,800
No, it sounds cheeky. As long
as you don't have claustrophobia.

180
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,994
- Claustro...
- Phobia.

181
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,796
- Fear of lifts.
- I'm not scared of lifts, am I?

182
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,074
I've never seen you in one.
I take lifts, you take the stairs, -

183
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:45,116
- and there are
no stairs in submarines.

184
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,879
That's her... That's her.

185
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,315
If you stay until after the 9 show,
we can walk home together.

186
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,870
- Is Dad home?
- Was my hat hanging on the elk?

187
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,677
- No, well then.
- That's a point.

188
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,670
- Help me.
- When will you learn to undress?

189
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,190
I didn't say you were home.

190
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,633
They'll really be surprised
in the morning.

191
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,632
What're you doing? The black-out.

192
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,072
You should know about that.

193
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,877
- When are the finals?
- They never tell you anything...

194
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,154
Not until the last second.

195
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,274
As long as they don't stop me
fighting Strong Arvid.

196
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,032
I'd like to get revenge on him.

197
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,720
But maybe he has been moved.

198
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,314
They can't move people to suit
the army boxing championship.

199
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,554
Now I really feel like I'm home.

200
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,436
What did you think of Lone?

201
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,837
What did you talk about?

202
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,956
She talked a hell of a lot.

203
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,712
Usually Danish isn't hard.
I didn't understand a word she said.

204
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:52,314
Some dialect,
north Jutland or something.

205
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,670
Sigge...

206
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,873
What if she said she had syphilis?

207
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,798
I'm just looking up a word.

208
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:53,560
I usually do that... Did it,
when Mr. Möllerström was here.

209
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,753
- What's the word?
- Words I don't understand.

210
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,352
We just have a small dictionary
at home, there's not much in it.

211
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:09,557
- I understand. What's the word?
- The word now?

212
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,110
You mean now, Miss?

213
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,870
- Mediocre.
- Moderate ability.

214
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,518
- Now you don't have to look it up.
- Thank you.

215
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,077
- Are there more words?
- No...

216
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,036
I just wanted to see
if it says anything else.

217
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,673
Well? What did it say?

218
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,759
Mediocre, Latin mediocris.

219
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,992
Mediocrity,
person of moderate ability.

220
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,113
Work of no particular value.

221
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,633
I didn't know
the noun was mediocrity.

222
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,392
Obviously,
we learn something new every day.

223
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,875
Good-bye.

224
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,354
- When does it have to be back?
- Before 5, he's going fishing.

225
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,951
How is your turtle today?

226
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,030
Thanks for asking.

227
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:48,909
- What is it Albert?
- I don't know if you can stay.

228
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,715
Don't worry.

229
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,758
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

230
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,078
- What's he doing?
- Looking up a word.

231
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,399
- What's Sticko doing?
- What the hell are you doing?

232
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:19,193
Since Albert hasn't returned, I need
someone else to go to the map room.

233
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,472
I'll help you.

234
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,391
That was the maths teacher.

235
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,797
- What number was it?
- 62.

236
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,797
- It wasn't the German measles.
- Good, sit down.

237
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:34,676
Stig better take that back.
Only he knows where it goes.

238
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,798
Miss, it's the monitor's job.
The nurse was a force majeure.

239
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,198
Yes, indeed.

240
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,160
- Do you see anything?
- No.

241
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,076
Sit down, it's not
the first aeroplane to fly over.

242
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,400
- But it's a flying fortress.
- Sit down.

243
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,718
Plexiglas on the way.

244
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,836
- How many are there?
- Five.

245
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,792
You can carve Plexiglas with a knife.

246
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,790
- Any bullet holes?
- Are there some in the tail fin?

247
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,320
- What's wrong? You look sick.
- No, I'm not sick.

248
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,792
Maybe I am after all... Yes.

249
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,029
- Let me feel.
- I'd better go home to bed.

250
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,039
- Christ, that's my bike!
- You'll get it back tomorrow.

251
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:09,439
- Have I done wrong?
- No, you haven't.

252
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,714
Don't come unannounced.
My husband may be home.

253
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,870
You said he has a car.
What make is it?

254
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,232
American.
It has a deer on the front.

255
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,512
- A Dodge. Colour?
- Blue.

256
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,475
Darker than your eyes.

257
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,879
- He usually parks it in the garage.
- So I just look there.

258
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,517
No, it's not that easy.
Sometimes it's in the street.

259
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,350
There are 4 streets.

260
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,315
Check all 4, for Christ's sake!

261
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,993
A tip. At home he mostly sits
in the kitchen listening to music.

262
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,874
If you hear Beethoven,
it's strictly <i>verboten.</i>

263
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,914
For safety's sake
always use the kitchen stairs.

264
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,238
I never listen to music.
I'm tone deaf.

265
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,512
But certain signals reach me
all the same.

266
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:30,274
- What subject do you study extra?
- English.

267
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,157
I should... We drank juice.

268
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:46,597
Or rather, I drank juice,
and my teacher drank... coffee.

269
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,440
I was just drying the glasses.

270
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,114
Oh, I have to go to work.

271
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,680
- Listen to this.
- What?

272
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,110
- What?
- Aunt Bertha broke her leg.

273
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,631
It serves her right.

274
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,916
Be easy with your extra pupils.
That one was a nervous wreck.

275
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,872
The first in bed lies under.

276
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,711
Come...

277
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,199
Don't be afraid. Come.

278
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,111
Miss, did you see
what the Stockholmer did?

279
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,800
No...

280
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,917
When I took down the map...
He pushed me against the wall.

281
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,275
- Then he ran away with the map.
- We'll deal with that later.

282
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:10,231
Where did I buy it?
I bought it in London.

283
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,070
I just managed to outfit myself.

284
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,512
The last travelling Father did.

285
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,598
He sat in his chair.

286
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,794
The cars just had to wait,
while we wheeled across Bond Street.

287
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,232
The Rolls and the Bentleys.

288
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:33,471
Daddy smiled once, just once.
And then the war came.

289
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,755
Don't talk about Daddy,
not about Daddy.

290
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,400
- You're talking about your father.
- I only do that in intimate moments.

291
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:53,832
And your father. I want to know
all about you. What does he do?

292
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,354
He hunts elk. An elk hunter.

293
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,553
A seasonal worker?

294
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,755
- That's just in the autumn.
- We're so poor.

295
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,035
No, he's a private chauffeur,
for managing directors and such.

296
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:18,077
But he did shoot an elk once,
but he said he "downed" it.

297
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:24,675
He drove a few aristocrats
to their hunting grounds -

298
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,399
- and then they sat him on a stool
and put a gun in his hands.

299
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,152
Not shot, "downed".

300
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:40,037
It's at home, takes up half the flat.
It's smaller than yours.

301
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,280
We have to duck when we pass it.

302
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:53,160
Olle! Olle!

303
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,756
- Where is your hat?
- Can't I work without it?

304
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,638
Are you crazy?
It's to keep your hair in place.

305
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,390
- Go in and sell, for God sake!
- But nobody wants any.

306
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,798
Go in.

307
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,070
Chocolate, sweets, cream cakes.

308
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:51,036
Nobody wants any.
Start the film.

309
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,469
Olle! Olle...

310
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,991
Move, okay? 3 minutes to go.

311
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:37,116
- Seconds leave the ring.
- Last round...

312
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,233
Third round.

313
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,680
Get up! Sigge, up!

314
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,914
One, two, three...

315
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,597
Eight, nine, ten. Out!

316
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,431
Sigge! Sigge!

317
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:38,872
Stop. I'm first...
Anyway, elders come first.

318
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,915
Will we make it?

319
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:38,555
<i>We'll begin with the air raid alarm,</i>
<i>which sounds like this.</i>

320
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,720
Are you sure
that's the Stockholm accent?

321
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,200
Viola.

322
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,880
Viola, happy birthday.
I didn't go to Nässjö.

323
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,756
Viola!

324
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,352
Well, hello, where's the wife?

325
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:46,237
- Has she gone on an errand?
- Yes.

326
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,593
- Are you behind in English again?
- Yes.

327
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,594
A vase. Just perfect.

328
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,709
Tchaikovsky. Romeo and Juliet.

329
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,632
- The girl on the balcony.
- Yeah, I know.

330
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,197
Straight gin.

331
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,155
Not bad.

332
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,832
But you should see the plans
I drew for my real innovations.

333
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:37,035
This is just small potatoes.

334
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,550
A bit of hocus-pocus for customers.

335
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,119
But not without
a certain elevating effect on turnover.

336
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:51,237
There's a lot...
You think of a lot of things, -

337
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,117
- when you sit behind the wheel.

338
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:01,952
And you know, the roads
around Göinge, straight and boring.

339
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,197
You have lots of time.

340
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:10,078
Lots of time to think
there among those spruce trees.

341
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,355
It's not complicated.

342
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,840
You just regulate the flow
with a little bolt on the back.

343
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,000
If you're away, or made some
unwise New Year's resolutions, -

344
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,752
- you can stop the flow
and turn it on again January 2.

345
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:35,230
Understand? As easy as pie.
You know, this is just peanuts.

346
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:41,880
A little gimmick for customers,
but it makes an impression.

347
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,915
And that's what counts
in my business, making an impression.

348
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:50,876
Take my name.
It's not Kjell as on my sign.

349
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:55,359
Kjell is no good, boring.
Christ! No, no...

350
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,997
It's only by the pastor
and my sign that I'm named Kjell.

351
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,717
My real name... Frank.
Frank to my customers.

352
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,674
They think of Frank Sinatra,
and I'm half-way in.

353
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:13,798
Everybody likes Sinatra, right?
I prefer Mahler myself.

354
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,190
And Beethoven, late Beethoven.
String quartets. <i>Grosse fuge.</i>

355
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,953
Cream for the cat.
Skol, to Beethoven.

356
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:32,440
- Frank... and your name is?
- Stig.

357
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,995
SLEEP ON.
KJELL IS AT KOLMÅRDEN. V.

358
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:26,478
Good-morning, Albert.
Is anyone absent today besides Stig?

359
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,957
Is Stig absent?

360
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,836
Yes, I met his mother on the tram.

361
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:47,114
Hi. We must hurry.
Breakfast break will soon be over.

362
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,635
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

363
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,833
It's coming soon.

364
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,200
It swells, swells...

365
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:39,593
- Do you want some juice?
- Yes please.

366
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:53,437
Think of what we talked about.
Stockings made of nylon.

367
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,119
- Nylon stockings.
- Thanks.

368
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,915
That's what Yank parachutes
are made of.

369
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:04,797
It's like sandpaper round the thighs.
Women aren't so dumb.

370
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,517
Think about it.
Where do wool stockings come from?

371
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:16,194
The ones that warm ladies' legs?
It comes from curly little lambs.

372
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,155
- And shoes, where are they from?
- From cows.

373
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:26,800
Yes. Mooo, that's it.

374
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:32,671
Cows. Milk under their bellies
and leather on their backs.

375
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:38,751
And let's not forget
the hard-working little silkworm.

376
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,351
The slant-eyed workhorse
from China.

377
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,600
A silent character, certainly, -

378
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:52,671
- but it works and struggles
by the sweat of its brow.

379
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,319
Not to mention cotton,
which grows in the fields of Alabama.

380
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,399
What do these materials
have in common?

381
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:06,629
Well, they come from...

382
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,514
From abroad.

383
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:14,840
But we have lambs and cows
in Sweden. For God's sake, Stig.

384
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,477
- No they come from...?
- From nature?

385
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:23,152
- Of course.
- They move.

386
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,956
Move, make noises...
well, not all of them.

387
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:31,313
- Run and play when young.
- Silkworms don't run...

388
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,797
- They lie in cocoons when young.
- Sure.

389
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:42,396
But the rest. Wool, leather...
They run around and dance and play.

390
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,799
Moo, baa...

391
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:53,600
And where does nylon come from?
Oily machines in the Pentagon.

392
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:59,956
On top of all that, it's
a dumb product. Nylon has no voice.

393
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:05,918
It's not just unnatural,
it's an abomination.

394
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,670
It's misbegotten,
it's worse than that, worse.

395
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:13,920
It's, it's...

396
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:18,080
- An anomaly.
- Exactly. Exactly. It's...

397
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:23,230
- It's an...
- Anomaly.

398
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:28,390
That's it... Skol to wool!

399
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:34,600
- What's on at the cinema tonight?
- "They Died With Their Boots On".

400
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,111
- Skol!
- To wool.

401
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,471
Dad's home. Your hat.

402
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:59,320
- You bought a gramophone record?
- Wait. Listen.

403
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:04,549
Was it expensive?
Stig bought a gramophone record.

404
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,197
It's Sigge's gramophone.
He can't use it.

405
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,757
But Sigge's at sea, Seymor.

406
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,352
I'll listen later.

407
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,600
Let the cat out!

408
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,433
Let the cat out!

409
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,351
Can't you hear me?

410
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,519
Jesus Christ!

411
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,310
- You old bastard!
- What did you call me?

412
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:06,036
- You old bastard!
- Stop it, boys!

413
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,152
What does the stocking say?

414
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:43,918
You don't have to explain,
if you don't insist on it.

415
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,158
Sit down.

416
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,159
Sit down!

417
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:02,835
Swedish? Or English?
You must speak it perfectly by now.

418
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:16,232
Explanation, the young man asks.

419
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:25,275
But can the husband keep calm?

420
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:29,076
There are certain things -

421
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,639
- that shouldn't be
in a certain place at a certain time.

422
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:38,550
A lady's garter, for example.

423
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,036
On top of everything violet.

424
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,119
Where should it not be, -

425
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,472
- when the old salesman comes home
after a week on the road?

426
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,240
In the back seat of his car.

427
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:56,676
If it happens to lie there,
who should definitely not find it?

428
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,432
His wife, of course.

429
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:08,551
Wrong thing, wrong place,
wrong finder, wrong time.

430
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:18,239
Well, he sells ladies underwear.

431
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:23,231
Couldn't the garter have come
from his sample collection?

432
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,671
No.

433
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:32,070
No, it couldn't.

434
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,069
It was in fact used.

435
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,960
What an idiot!

436
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:46,316
That garter cost me a son.
Nothing could repair that.

437
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:50,480
One week after the wedding.

438
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,594
And then, violet, the colour of sin.

439
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:00,433
Of course, booze was to blame.

440
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:05,840
You don't know what you do,
what you did, what you should do.

441
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:11,036
It simply just tastes too good.

442
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,598
Sticko. How are you? I'm fine.

443
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:43,510
There's a new match
next Thursday. Sigge.

444
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:48,395
It's true...
It's the same language.

445
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:57,156
I can't fit it together.
I can't fit it together.

446
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,753
I can't fit it together.

447
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,876
I can't fit it together!

448
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:47,599
The rule for going on the wagon.
Avoid hotel dining rooms.

449
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:53,114
You have to sleep in a hotel,
but skip dining rooms.

450
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:58,952
Imagine, <i>Lilly's Farewell</i> played
by some dusty dining-room trio, -

451
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:02,278
- when you're sitting there
hungering for Mahler.

452
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,679
Then it's tempting
to order two whites and a brown.

453
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,998
And wash down the misery.

454
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:15,036
And they have dandruff
on their collars, all three of them.

455
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,992
There they are.

456
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,519
Emil, Emil!

457
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,914
Once more.

458
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,875
Shoot now, Emil.

459
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,189
Now we'll drink a toast.

460
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,950
- Skol.
- Skol, and welcome.

461
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,276
- Stina, more presents.
- There's no name on this one.

462
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:40,190
Have I got an unknown admirer here?

463
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,950
You'd better watch out, Seymor.

464
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:56,871
- What will you use that for?
- I don't understand.

465
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,438
- What's so funny about the duck?
- A family secret.

466
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:30,034
- Curt, play another piece.
- Yes, do that.

467
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,877
- I want to show you something.
- What?

468
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:51,760
- What do you want to show me?
- You'll see.

469
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,393
Stand there.

470
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,560
Don't look before I tell you to.

471
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:27,031
Now you can look.

472
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:30,199
Do what you want with me.

473
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:35,839
Don't be shy.
This is what a woman looks like.

474
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:39,716
I've thought of everything.
I locked the door.

475
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,676
The others won't come for a while.
You saw how many cakes were left.

476
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,635
You don't have to worry
about me getting pregnant.

477
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,437
It tells on the package
how to use them.

478
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:00,592
I've thought of everything.
If there's a lot of blood...

479
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:17,556
If I could explain...

480
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:29,350
- If I could explain, Lisbeth...
- You don't have to explain. Just go.

481
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:34,954
If your mum asks about me,
say I ate too much cake.

482
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:46,155
- Listen, I found that quotation.
- I want to hear this now.

483
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:51,674
- Just turn it down a bit.
- No, I want it like that.

484
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,358
Why are you with Frank?
Why did you get married?

485
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:09,840
He is my hostage.
Frank is a hostage I took once.

486
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:17,638
You should have seen
all the gentlemen who courted me.

487
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,400
They would always think
before opening their mouths, -

488
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,240
- so they never spoke.

489
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:28,674
These were courting "cavaliers".
Well-tailored, with nothing inside.

490
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:33,033
I called them courting <i>canailleries,</i>
scoundrels.

491
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:36,631
Scoundrels who were just
after my father's money.

492
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:42,393
And when Frank came, you should
have seen my aunts' faces.

493
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,719
He brought fresh air into the salons,
they couldn't stand that.

494
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,437
But I got air
and could begin to breathe.

495
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,074
But that air is used up now.

496
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,240
Shouldn't you let your hostage go?
Why don't you divorce?

497
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:04,560
He must have someone to come
home to.

498
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:08,310
You've seen it for yourself,
otherwise he'll sink down.

499
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,672
Are you sure of that?

500
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,076
I know where
to buy cheap condoms.

501
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:28,832
If you buy five hundred,
you get them for half price.

502
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:33,512
What do you want 500 condoms for?
You have no use for one.

503
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:37,760
Advance planning.
Like, if you fuck three times a day, -

504
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:43,080
- then you will use them
in less than six months.

505
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:50,196
Only rabbits fuck three times a day.
And they don't need condoms.

506
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,393
Nobody is forcing you to buy.

507
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:15,750
- You said you're off booze.
- I know, but there are reasons.

508
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:20,876
You come to a house of mourning.
There should be spruce twigs.

509
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:28,715
The gramophone plays suitable
music. <i>Kindertottenlieder.</i>

510
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,437
NYLON HYSTERIA IN AMERICA

511
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,960
<i>- Toten.</i>
- What?

512
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:41,918
It's <i>toten</i>. They're not hottentots.

513
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:46,273
No, I can't speak German.

514
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:52,033
But I hear that it's sad music.

515
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:58,153
- Children's death. <i>Kindertoten.</i>
- Yes, yes...

516
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:04,038
<i>Toten</i> or <i>totten,</i>
they die in any case.

517
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,118
- "Nylon hysteria in America."
- It will soon be here.

518
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:25,951
- It's just a matter of time.
- Maybe it's a fad.

519
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,949
- It'll pass.
- No, no.

520
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:34,313
Once women wrap their thighs
in sandpaper, you can't stop them.

521
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:38,116
It's sad that they don't know better,
but I mean if...

522
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:44,237
You mean I should give in
and begin selling sandpaper?

523
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:48,116
Never... Never!

524
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,279
Christ,
it's not primarily about money.

525
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:56,396
It's really, it's...

526
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,196
- An anomaly.
- Exactly.

527
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,436
But...

528
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,189
Even if...

529
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,836
Even if what?

530
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:33,514
- It's too late anyway.
- Why is it too late?

531
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:37,634
Go down in the cellar and you'll see.

532
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,797
You mean you've...

533
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,516
Remember that batch of wool pants?

534
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:49,751
Yes, on Lundavägen.
Suspiciously cheap. You bought it?

535
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,759
I couldn't resist at the price.

536
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,590
- Was it a big batch?
- Barely room in the cellar.

537
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:03,274
- So you rented Anderbjörks' cellar.
- Christ no, it was full!

538
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:09,590
Whose cellar, Frank?
I'm thinking about the price.

539
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,916
You couldn't rent...?

540
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:19,077
Yes, the Goat's.

541
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,359
Not the Goat's...

542
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:27,033
Yes, the Goat.

543
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,354
But that's not all.

544
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:56,476
No? Another bargain-price batch?

545
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:00,879
- Yes, but not wool.
- No. Not wool.

546
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:04,118
Could it be silk? No.

547
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:08,439
What the hell! Why not silk?

548
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,439
Was it silk?

549
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:21,440
- Feinberger...
- And the Goat's cellar was full?

550
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:27,637
- You could hardly close the door.
- So you had to rent another place?

551
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:33,552
- Yes, so what?
- Where? That crook Karl Ohlsson?

552
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:41,236
Yes, more expensive than the Goat's.
It was packed full of crap.

553
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:45,992
I had to empty it.
It was a hell of a job.

554
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:54,200
I would like to see their bedroom.
The old lady had jam everywhere.

555
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:58,555
Every day, for weeks...

556
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:13,150
- I've already written it, Miss.
- Do as I say.

557
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:42,630
THE COAST IS CLEAR. 7.30 P.M.

558
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:58,953
- May I go to the toilet, Miss?
- Of course.

559
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:13,716
GIRLS

560
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:32,076
- That's all for today.
- Thank you.

561
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,675
- The turtle didn't hurt you?
- You promised...

562
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:53,433
I wasn't talking about Stig.
I said the turtle.

563
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,393
You learned something anyway.

564
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:02,391
- You talk like them up there.
- What good is that to me?

565
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:07,117
You can talk to the turtle
in the Stockholm dialect.

566
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:29,677
COME TO THE BOX. STIG.

567
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:36,360
Weren't you going to the john?
It's vacant now.

568
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:42,113
- But I've been already.
- I mean, for safety's sake.

569
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:46,394
Yes, you're right.

570
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:56,792
Welcome aboard.

571
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,559
Where did she go?

572
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:11,471
Strange... Without clothes.

573
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:32,239
Damn. It's moving.
We'll just go along.

574
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:41,556
- Where did you learn all that?
- At work.

575
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:46,509
I sell chocolate in the cinema:
Film kisses and stuff...

576
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:29,637
I'm so happy.

577
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:36,079
<i>I shall give some of the names</i>
<i>so you will understand the effort-</i>

578
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:41,355
<i>- that has gone</i>
<i>into finding the men of The Wolf...</i>

579
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,514
- Hot?
- God yes.

580
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:52,397
The whole factory wanted open
windows except that bitch Holm.

581
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:56,514
She can't stand fresh air.
They were closed all day.

582
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:01,636
We'll have milk for dinner.
I traded coupons with Svea.

583
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:05,550
Rydbergs are famous for, five letters?

584
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,913
Santa... Santa Claus.

585
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:14,438
You knew it.

586
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:21,194
You should drink milk.
That's where the calcium is.

587
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:25,519
- Predator, 4 letters, with an L in it?
- Wolf.

588
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:28,952
- You knew that too.
- No, I didn't think of it.

589
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,470
We gave you milk
when you were small.

590
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:34,479
That's why you and Sigge
have straight backs.

591
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:38,993
All the kids who didn't get milk
have crooked backs.

592
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:43,160
- What is it?
- Nothing.

593
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:48,719
That's why he's such a good boxer.
The Central Dairy did it.

594
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:51,913
I'll go and unpack now.

595
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:58,111
<i>The crown</i>
<i>has taken over the ship now.</i>

596
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:04,237
<i>This is an important role.</i>
<i>It was equipped with echolocation.</i>

597
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:14,351
Wolf's jaws... The Wolf.

598
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:28,355
- What's wrong with you?
- It's nothing.

599
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:35,990
You look like you're going to faint.
Puberty.

600
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:40,911
<i>Sven Jerring's report</i>
<i>from the salvage ship Belos.</i>

601
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:05,119
- No.
- Any adults at home?

602
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:08,233
No, just me.

603
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:13,752
I'll stay until you've read it.

604
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:29,119
The submarine Wolf
just finished trials at sea outside...

605
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:39,469
Everything all right?
I'll close the door.

606
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:24,112
<i>Now a report from the west coast</i>
<i>on the rescue work.</i>

607
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:29,395
<i>Belos here.</i>
<i>We have no information...</i>

608
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:41,197
I'll do that.

609
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:46,031
- Are you going to help?
- I usually do.

610
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:13,000
<i>Something has occurred</i>
<i>that will be reported on radio...</i>

611
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,511
How long have you known?

612
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:21,033
Why didn't you say anything?

613
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:23,914
Why didn't you say anything?

614
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:30,435
Sit down. I didn't know anything
before we did the crossword.

615
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:34,395
- Predator in 4 letters.
- An L in the middle.

616
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,513
I knew then. I got Sigge's letter.

617
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:42,431
He and I had a code.
From the kids' pages.

618
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:45,439
A line from dot to dot gives a picture.

619
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:48,439
Remember the giraffes?

620
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:53,920
It was always giraffes.
But this time it was a wolf's jaws.

621
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:59,240
Then I knew he'd got his wish,
to serve on that damn submarine.

622
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:04,390
- I knew nothing before that.
- Why weren't we informed?

623
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:08,799
We were. A telegram.
I hid it behind the books.

624
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,119
I couldn't... I'm sorry, Mum.

625
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:16,996
I intended to tell you a number
of times, but I just couldn't.

626
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:23,356
I thought, if there's no danger,
I didn't want to worry you.

627
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:28,032
And there is no danger, Mum.
They've sent out all the ships.

628
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:31,836
- All the ships are searching.
- They're all searching now.

629
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:11,431
One... The back row.

630
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:16,152
That will be 1.50.

631
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:23,430
<i>Lieutenant von Döbeln in person, -</i>

632
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:26,917
<i>- ready to hit</i>
<i>the French at Hamburg.</i>

633
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:30,591
<i>It's 30 years ago</i>
<i>since my first battle.</i>

634
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:36,398
<i>And now I must beg to get</i>
<i>a little whiff of gunpowder.</i>

635
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,434
<i>Well, there'll be no rattling...</i>

636
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:43,759
I'll see if I can find him.

637
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:48,960
<i>From headquarters</i>
<i>to General von Döbeln.</i>

638
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:55,236
<i>- Please seal this.</i>
<i>- Yes, General.</i>

639
01:37:55,440 --> 01:38:00,231
<i>Sorry General but my betrothed...</i>

640
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:18,959
- At least let me try to explain.
- Awful! I won't talk about it.

641
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:25,157
I never want to see you again.
I wish you'd move away.

642
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:31,436
Or that we would, so I don't happen
to meet such a disgusting person.

643
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,719
It's open!

644
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:04,720
- We have to talk.
- Look who's here.

645
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:09,949
Look who's here, a rare guest.

646
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:14,959
Give me the glass,
you might cut yourself.

647
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:21,871
So you don't want to screw
the little schoolteacher today?

648
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:26,154
No biology lesson
with practical application?

649
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:29,876
It doesn't suit you now, right?

650
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:41,157
Not in the hooky-playing mood?
I'll show you, by Christ!

651
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,713
Unbutton me!

652
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:02,759
Didn't you hear what I said?
Unbutton me.

653
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:07,359
Undress me, undress me!

654
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:12,918
Undress me, then take that off!

655
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:15,954
Take it off...

656
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:21,394
Didn't you hear what I said?
Take it off!

657
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:26,470
That's it. My brassiere too.

658
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:31,277
No cheating,
you know exactly how to do it.

659
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:37,238
Unbutton it there.
That's it, open the clasp.

660
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:40,717
Let go!

661
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:50,472
There. What do we find here?

662
01:40:55,640 --> 01:41:01,272
No messing with the food.
The entrée first.

663
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:06,316
You haven't forgotten
your table manners, have you?

664
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:22,154
I need some advice.

665
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,829
I'm listening.

666
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:30,354
It's about a pupil
I've had problems with for some time.

667
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:35,435
Stig, please stay behind.

668
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:49,920
- It's over, after that bottle.
- I don't know what you mean.

669
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:54,558
I asked you to stay
because I feel I have to flunk you.

670
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:58,037
- You won't be in my class...
- Flunk? What the hell is this?

671
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:01,517
You will not be in my class next year.

672
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:05,316
The official explanation will
be repeated absence from class, -

673
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,160
- without a parental note.

674
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:15,278
Also, fail tests in my subject,
which is personally offensive.

675
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:19,235
You know
the unofficial explanation...

676
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:24,515
I can't stand to have you
in my classroom any more.

677
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:33,277
It happens to be a place
of education, not a rabbit farm.

678
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:45,680
Stop!

679
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:58,511
Why are you lying? You know
why I wasn't present at your lessons.

680
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:02,873
I was in your bed waiting for you
to come home for a fuck.

681
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:06,960
- Don't talk like that.
- What?

682
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:12,235
Do you think it was something
special? It was just ordinary fucks.

683
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:14,875
Silence!

684
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:19,040
- Are you afraid I'll tell?
- Who'd believe you?

685
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:47,400
Please leave the classroom.

686
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:52,554
Albert...

687
01:44:55,400 --> 01:45:00,475
Stig.
This was a hard decision, -

688
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:05,630
- what with your family situation.

689
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:12,238
Nonetheless,
we are all in agreement -

690
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:15,877
- that you shall repeat Class 3
next year.

691
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:21,872
We don't see this as punishment.
We see it as a favour.

692
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:27,360
We want to be certain that
when you leave your old school -

693
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:33,431
- you will take with you in life
everything it has to give you.

694
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:40,114
We want you to leave the nest,
fully fledged.

695
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:31,070
And then she cut out my marks...

696
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:08,399
How much have you had to drink?
How much did you drink?

697
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:13,516
- I can take the helmet off.
- No, keep it on, sit down.

698
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:34,638
- It just tastes too good.
- You know she's lying.

699
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:38,117
You know why I didn't have a note
when I was absent.

700
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:41,597
Don't you? I need your help now!

701
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:45,157
- Can I offer you something?
- You can offer me the truth.

702
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:49,513
You know she's lying.
She lies like hell.

703
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:54,476
Talk to her, Frank, or Kjell,
or whatever the hell you're called.

704
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:58,310
You don't...

705
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:03,317
It doesn't have to be official, -

706
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:06,957
- but you must talk to her.

707
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:10,471
Can't you do something?

708
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:27,879
But you'll do anything to creep
to that pussy once a year, right?

709
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:42,671
There's nothing left. She's torn
wide open between her legs.

710
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:55,111
"Storks saw us here in Skåne..."

711
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,395
Sit down.

712
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:09,758
Stig.

713
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:14,910
It's something about his brother.
They found The Wolf.

714
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:46,351
- A flying fortress.
- Do you see it, Nisse?

715
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:50,634
- Two engines out.
- It's coming right here.

716
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:55,312
What's wrong? It's coming here!

717
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:20,311
Petrol.

718
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:27,797
- It's burning.
- Was that the monitor in 3B?

719
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:33,918
Anything broken?

720
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:51,117
<i>They are pumping the dry-dock</i>
<i>out rapidly.</i>

721
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:53,960
<i>Soon the mystery will be revealed.</i>

722
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:57,471
<i>A mine has blown a gaping hole</i>
<i>in the hull.</i>

723
01:50:57,680 --> 01:51:01,037
<i>The explosion was so powerful</i>
<i>the hull almost broke in two.</i>

724
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:03,880
<i>Fractures are visible.</i>

725
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:07,869
<i>It's a miracle it didn't break</i>
<i>in the middle during salvage.</i>

726
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:11,869
<i>The Wolf went straight</i>
<i>to the bottom.</i>

727
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:16,074
<i>It hit a rock there</i>
<i>and the bows caved in completely.</i>

728
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:18,431
<i>It must have been terrible.</i>

729
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:24,671
<i>This is the last time a Swedish</i>
<i>navy ship will be named "Wolf".</i>

730
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:27,998
<i>Recovery of the bodies of the 33</i>
<i>crew members began immediately.</i>

731
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:33,673
<i>A crane lowered them one after</i>
<i>the other onto navel houseboats.</i>

732
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:41,469
<i>All the crew members</i>
<i>were immediately identified.</i>

733
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:51,879
I've rewound the film, -

734
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:59,078
- and I've run that news reel
at least 20 times for you.

735
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,876
Now I'll go up and shut it off.

736
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:09,839
Then we'll go home.
It's best that way.

737
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,391
It must be twig...

738
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:39,913
We would have written notes for you
if you just asked us.

739
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:44,558
If you were so tired
of all that night work.

740
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:50,631
It's just a matter of time
before the god RA comes up.

741
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:54,117
- Night work?
- Yes.

742
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:57,711
Sometimes you didn't get home
til after we'd gone to bed.

743
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:02,233
I never saw a sick note,
or whatever they're called.

744
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:04,875
Note of absence.

745
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:09,393
I can't forgive myself.
Some mornings you looked exhausted.

746
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:14,197
I shouldn't have let you go
to the cinema night after night.

747
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:19,439
What is it, Stig?

748
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:26,031
- What is what?
- There's something else.

749
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:30,120
It's not only Sigge
and failing in school.

750
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:36,032
Surely you can tell me,
I'm your mother.

751
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:45,593
Another time,
when you're older and wiser.

752
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:02,872
Where's Dad?

753
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:48,039
Urban Sahlin.

754
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:02,394
Stig Santesson.

755
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:08,910
Stig Santesson.

756
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:12,590
Not present.

757
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:15,793
Karl-Erik Schön.

758
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:07,596
Karl-Erik Schön.

759
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:37,959
FEAR OF THE LORD
IS THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM
