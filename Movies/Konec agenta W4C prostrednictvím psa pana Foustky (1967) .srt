1
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,780
Why do I love animals so much?

2
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,420
Juan...

3
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,420
Excuse me. The Chief is calling...

4
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,020
F-U-K-W-H-M calling.

5
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,020
O. K! Coming...

6
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,620
It's always like that.

7
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,010
When will you get back?

8
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,210
Pssst.

9
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,740
He can't get away. Send the obituary.

10
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,770
The black or the white one? - The mournful news I said!

11
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,580
Look out, he's suspicious...

12
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,620
Look out, he's suspicious...

13
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,210
He's suspicious... Over...

14
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,610
He's suspicious - fire!

15
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,460
Juan!

16
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,020
Juan!

17
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,370
Wait!

18
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,420
He's got away again. Pack up!

19
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,420
Presents

20
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,610
Agent W4C's end through Mr. Frusta's dog

21
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,130
Story

22
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,130
Screenplay

23
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,130
Dramatist

24
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,340
Cast

25
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,300
Music

26
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,340
Vocalist

27
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,380
Conducted by

28
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,100
Editor

29
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,140
Sound Engineer

30
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,100
Production Manager

31
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,810
Director of Photography

32
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,820
Directed by

33
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,020
Made at Film Studio Barrandov

34
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,420
In an unknown foreign city

35
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,890
An agency working for an unnamed power

36
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,620
Our Agency has got hold

37
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,740
of fabulously valuable information:

38
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,090
A microfilm of a plan

39
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,860
for the military utilization of Venus.

40
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,690
We were ready to hand over the microfilm in Prague...

41
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,700
in an anonymous town I mean...

42
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,020
to our allied White Fog Agency-

43
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,890
when our agent...

44
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,020
disappeared...

45
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,620
The lady working for White Fog is still in Pr...

46
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,020
in the anonymous town

47
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,140
and the microfilm

48
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,740
hidden in a salt-cellar-

49
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,980
on the table No 7 of a night-club

50
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,610
has to be found and handed over...

51
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,020
I'll go to the anonymous town

52
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,810
find the salt-cellar with the microfilm and deliver it to the White Fog agent.

53
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,210
Is that all? - It's more than enough.

54
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,300
Not easy as all that.

55
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,380
Get an eyeful of the lady.

56
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,100
She may have pinched it herself... What's her name?

57
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,340
Alice Roberts, most often.

58
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,420
Yes, she may have appropriated the microfilm.

59
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,020
You'll worm it out of her.

60
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,820
She looks pretty beastly, eh?

61
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,410
Uncommonly pretty beastly!

62
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,730
How shall I contact her? - You'll find her at the hotel bar.

63
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,420
You'll address her: ""Shall we dance?""

64
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,500
And she'll answer: ""As soon as I finish my brandy.""

65
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,620
M. Dujardin... - Show him in!

66
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,850
M. Dujardin,

67
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,900
this is our famous W4C.

68
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,820
Any new device to show us?

69
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,900
An apparently trivial requisite.

70
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,020
Inexpert handling,

71
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,100
however results in the discharge -

72
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,820
of tear-gas!

73
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,620
All inventions have their weak points! - I only wanted an explanation...

74
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,820
Pull here and you have a dagger.

75
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,130
The bell is an effective hand-grenade.

76
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,820
Sorry, I mean bomb

77
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,420
This here is a universal skeleton key.

78
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,820
Winding up will reverse the tape recording.

79
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,620
This here is a universal skeleton key.

80
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,660
Winding up will reverse the tape recording.

81
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,610
The alarm clock also contains

82
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,610
a microphone. On - out.

83
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,210
If the hands show 12,

84
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,620
I repeat, 12 o'clock,

85
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,220
a small nuclear explosion follows after 15 seconds.

86
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,250
And, what is most important:

87
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,610
It has a built-in Geiger counter.

88
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,020
That microfilm in Pr...

89
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,020
The anonymous town!

90
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,900
In... that town... was made...

91
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,620
slightly radio-active - and a Geiger counter

92
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,210
would be very useful.

93
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,820
Still, allow me to remark... What if it is a trap?

94
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,100
Of course it is a trap!

95
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,180
Our W4C feels in traps at home!

96
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,610
We won't even change the film

97
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,700
in that lift girl's camera.

98
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,490
And, because she's working for all big powers

99
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,410
and several lesser powers - that town will be swarming with secret agents...

100
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,620
And such troubled waters are W4C's favourite hunting ground.

101
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,810
I am sure, dear Cyril Juan,

102
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,180
that the precious salt-cellar will get into the proper hands!

103
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,020
Keep calm... If salt be wasted

104
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,100
what wouldst thou salt with?

105
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,210
What? - That's the Scripture!

106
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,420
It's the police.

107
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,020
He came to ask about a candlestick - dropped from the window.

108
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,410
I nearly forgot: It also shoots!

109
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,420
Sorry, I'm a bit on edge today.

110
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,850
Good thing this is an allied power.

111
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,610
There...

112
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,700
Gentlemen...

113
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,020
Good luck!

114
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,420
What a man!

115
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,610
Juan...

116
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,820
Cyril...

117
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,020
This trap will kill him!

118
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,610
Such a difficult case - could only be assigned to W4C.

119
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,010
And we'll liquidate him at last.

120
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,410
Then we can sell the salt-cellar to all the other agents.

121
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,580
Excellent work, Resident!

122
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,740
This salt-cellar is worth a billion! - Dollars?

123
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,610
Idiot! Crowns!

124
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,220
Your task

125
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,010
won't be too difficult, Idiot... err... Resident.

126
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,010
In another unnamed city

127
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,860
An agency working for another unnamed power

128
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,020
The famous W4C coming to Prague!

129
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,100
Yes, he is.

130
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,820
What does he want here, anyhow?

131
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,780
He has to hand over something to the White Fog agent.

132
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,980
Then why bother me with this?

133
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,410
Shouldn't we know what it all about?

134
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,410
Well, you may be right... Any of our men available?

135
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,500
Not one of them.

136
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,010
What are you talking about? We have... err... Balsanek, Doruzka...

137
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,020
They have their assignments!

138
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,180
Or... this here... Foustka?

139
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,570
Mr. Foustka is our bookkeeper!

140
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,020
Never mind. He'll do, it's easy enough.

141
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,420
Out of order. - Fetch him here!

142
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,420
How did you get in here? Just when I'm doing the taxes!

143
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,610
What's that?

144
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,410
Where's your place? Don't try to talk me over.

145
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,010
Where's your place?

146
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,010
Nothing doing,

147
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,820
you're a naughty doggie - and you'll stand in the corner!

148
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,610
Now, stay there...

149
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,970
Mr. Foustka, the Chief wants you!

150
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,020
I can't. I'm busy! - At once!

151
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,700
It's the assessment, probably. Stay where you are, and behave!

152
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,210
Come in, Foustka!

153
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,010
Excuse me, this clock is slow.

154
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,020
And punctuality being the courtesy of kings...

155
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,010
That can wait, that can wait

156
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,010
Well, Mr. Foustka, I have - we have

157
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,170
an assignment for you - and it's external.

158
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,820
This gentleman will arrive from Paris by air.

159
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,900
We call him...

160
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,410
W4C - W4C

161
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,420
Follow him from the airport and find out what he's doing here.

162
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,210
And that's all, that's all. - All right, I only...

163
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,020
All this without any fuss or scandal. Give me a call if necessary!

164
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,100
I only wanted...

165
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,020
It's nothing difficult. Here, read up these directions...

166
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,100
You don't understand, I...

167
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,010
I give you two days and it's an order! OK

168
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,500
Aren't you an employee of this Agency? - Yes.

169
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,330
You are? Well then! - It's only

170
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,420
that I've been feeling poorly lately and with that stitch in my side -

171
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,610
I need a dietetic treatment... Will that be a problem?

172
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,260
Don't worry, Foustka- you'll be treated all right.

173
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,010
And if all goes well, you'll be made... chief accountant.

174
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,620
Yes...

175
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,020
You are now our... - Agent No 13 B.

176
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,420
Well, we're spies now, Pydie.

177
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,220
Follow him, he says...

178
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,820
But how do we recognize him?

179
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,820
Where's your manners?! Put your paws down!

180
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,210
W4C is landing in a few minutes.

181
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,570
Task No 1: Eliminate W4C.

182
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,260
Task No 2: Sell the salt-cellar for the highest price.

183
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,450
All the Agencies are greatly interested. The place will be swarming with agents

184
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,140
I repeat, it is worth a billion!

185
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,820
Where are you going to hide it? - In a safe, of course.

186
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,900
Idiot!

187
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,610
Every burglar goes straight for the safe.

188
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,100
I know from experience,

189
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,810
that the most conspicuous place is least conspicuous.

190
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,610
Everything ready at the hotel? - Yes.

191
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,090
To your stations!

192
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,620
Attention, attention! The flight from Paris has just landed

193
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,970
The flight from Paris has just landed.

194
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,420
Qu'est-ce que c'est monsieur?

195
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,300
Looking for a light blue car, sir?

196
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,010
My aunt has a light blue one. - Your uncle is expecting you.

197
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,820
Have all passengers alighted yet?

198
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,900
Gone through the customs already. - This one too?

199
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,620
Funny!

200
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,210
Here we are

201
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,010
What does this mean?!

202
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,180
The light blue car is being repaired.

203
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,810
We're getting near, get ready!

204
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,020
Step on it!

205
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,420
Get back there!

206
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,580
Get out and push!

207
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,010
Dear me...

208
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,100
Such a lot of glass -

209
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,410
that's pretty inconsiderate...

210
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,410
Pydie, I got no patches.

211
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,210
Darn it! Get away!

212
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,210
It's empty!

213
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,340
What's up? Where's the fire?

214
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,970
Come here, Pydie!

215
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,420
Hide here, quick!

216
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,410
See him?

217
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,020
That's him all right. After him!

218
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,610
Instead of arriving by plane - he comes up from a sewer!

219
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,100
Or is it a remote heating?

220
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,420
Who's down there? I see you!

221
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,810
You won't come out? Just you wait...

222
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,220
Good Lord, what a stink...

223
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,020
Home already, Pydie?

224
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,810
Good doggie...

225
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,860
Found out anything? Calm down...

226
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,020
What's up? What's the matter with you?

227
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,300
All right, I'm coming! No one's going to steal it!

228
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,860
Now lead on!

229
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,020
Not so fast - I'm no dog!

230
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,380
Which way? Make up your mind!

231
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,420
Where shall we put it? - Into the safe, of course!

232
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,810
Every fool - goes straight for the safe!

233
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,820
I know from experience -

234
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,220
the most conspicuous place to be least conspicuous.

235
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,140
You got to think a bit... Aha

236
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,730
Know him?

237
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,380
No... He's cunningly disguised.

238
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,820
I'll sound him myself!

239
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,620
No, I won't let you in!

240
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,890
Don't wave your arms - calling attention to me!

241
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,010
Just take a look at yourself!

242
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,420
Oh... I'm from the street-cleaning department.

243
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,620
Hmmm... - All right... no street-cleaning.

244
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,820
I'm going to tell you - but don't give me away.

245
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,740
I might get into trouble. I am the agent No 13B.

246
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,010
Are you? Hmmm...

247
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,020
I see... Come on in!

248
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,460
Come on!

249
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,500
Come in, come in! - Shush, be a good boy...

250
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,020
Here's a brush.

251
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,100
Thanks

252
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,210
Towel and soap at the lavatory. OK

253
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,820
A dog!

254
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,020
Is that your dog? - Yes.

255
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,420
I can't let it in. - It's a trained dog.

256
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,730
Well, as it's your...

257
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,740
What's your assignment here, anyway?

258
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,980
I can't tell you. - Why?

259
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,100
Well, it's so secret - that I don't know myself.

260
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,010
A darn difficult job this!

261
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,420
Well, thank you very much. - Don't mention it.

262
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,770
Who is it?

263
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,410
An imbecile!

264
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,980
And that's him? - Yes, disguised too.

265
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,010
A small smile plays on my face

266
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,010
hiding the sadness inside

267
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,420
But when the tears flow from my eyes

268
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,010
life feels sweet

269
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,580
A face of lies and deception

270
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:22,420
that only a young girl can see

271
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,610
One that will break the hearts

272
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,010
of innocents in the world at large

273
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,020
I used to laugh like other girls

274
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,850
What a handsome man!

275
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,530
But what a terrible mistake I made

276
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,100
A man enticed me to play a game

277
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,410
and then he broke my heart

278
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,020
Since that day I cry my tears

279
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,020
when others think to laugh

280
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,010
and laugh at times of sadness deep

281
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,100
which turns funerals into a farce

282
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,020
G 15 calling. The fools have let W4C slip through -

283
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,100
and here is now! Don't worry, the booth is sound-proof.

284
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,970
The last table by the door

285
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,420
the corner where they sit

286
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,890
when they've lost their faith in everything

287
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,020
It's nothing Excuse me...

288
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,420
and nothing more can be done

289
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,010
Reserve a spot for this brunette

290
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,820
who's been standing here for so long

291
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,220
so that she can turn her back on the world

292
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,410
and finally have a real good laugh

293
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,210
It's all right... ...he sits at the specified table.

294
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,260
Gin, four drops of lemon juice and a pinch of liquorice.

295
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,300
Right away

296
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,610
You'll be pinched all right!

297
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,700
This table is reserved...

298
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,420
Some guy is blocking my sight!

299
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,770
Allow me.

300
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,620
Let me put it right.

301
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,020
Twelve fifty... Good Lord...

302
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,410
Pydie, be quiet!

303
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,820
Chateaubriand - seventy two

304
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,940
and fifty again...

305
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,180
Yes?

306
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,210
Edward! Is it possible?

307
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,820
I beg your pardon? - You aren't Edward?

308
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,620
No.

309
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,210
Incredible!.. What a likeness!

310
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,620
You resemble someone, who is no longer with us.

311
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,620
All right, but I can't leave my dog...

312
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,700
You really aren't Edward?

313
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,220
I'm not.

314
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,730
No, you are not. You have more beautiful eyes.

315
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,980
I beg your pardon, but the remembrance was so intense...

316
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,740
We must have a drink.

317
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,820
She must have a drink.

318
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,420
I shouldn't drink, really! You aren't competing tomorrow.

319
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,890
May I call you Edward? What will it be?

320
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,220
Lemon juice. And you?

321
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,610
Whisky. - Whisky.

322
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,660
Right away

323
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,820
You are competing - in what? - Come tomorrow morning.

324
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,020
Some sort of a jump?

325
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,010
Oh... a high dive...

326
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,500
I never tried that

327
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,250
I was good at the side-stroke - when I was a boy.

328
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,020
Here you are Thank you

329
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,890
Shall we dance?

330
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,100
As soon as I finish my brandy. - This is whisky!

331
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,300
As soon as I finish my brandy. - All right - but it's whisky.

332
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,220
Isn't madam drinking whisky? - Whisky!

333
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,220
Well, shall we or shall we not? - Of course we shall. Excuse me Edward?

334
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,420
Of course

335
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,620
It's whisky all the same!

336
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,700
I loathe brandy.

337
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,530
Fix him somebody! He's screening my view!

338
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,620
I feel like in a vice!

339
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,890
To squeeze the salt-cellar out of you!

340
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,420
The one on table No 7 contained salt. Your agent has bungled it!

341
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,420
Isn't it a double-cross?

342
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,770
You may have sold it - to Turkey, for instance.

343
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,210
I never got it! But I am suspecting someone...

344
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,010
What about?

345
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,410
I think the Residen...

346
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,810
"She said "the Resident"!"

347
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,970
This wench knows everything! She has to be eliminated.

348
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,010
What does she say now? - I can't hear her-she keeps turning around.

349
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,500
She keeps turning around...

350
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,010
Only a fool would bug a chandelier!

351
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,420
Now they won't trust each other and as soon as they start murdering one another

352
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,210
we'll eliminate W4C

353
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,420
We'll get rid of the witness, that Alice

354
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:06,020
and we'll sell the goods - to the highest bidder.

355
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,100
Do you know it is worth a billion? Hmmm...

356
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,020
A billion what, Stern?

357
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,210
I don't care. What do you mean?

358
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,580
If you think it's dollars - you're an idiot.

359
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,020
A billion crowns, eh?

360
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,020
Hand it over, Stern! - What?

361
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,020
I'm asking you nicely, hand it over

362
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,610
Think you'll sell it - and leave me in the soup?

363
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,020
You were always slow -

364
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,100
in fixing the silencer!

365
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,810
One of my best men...

366
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,210
You inspire confidence. - Think so?

367
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,020
Isn't it gas?

368
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,420
Won't you stop the tape-recorder in your watch?

369
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,100
There. But the clock is still ticking

370
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,810
Still, time will always be our master.

371
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,410
They're jamming us!

372
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,610
Is this a novelty?

373
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,700
The latest novelty! - A novelty!

374
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,890
A novelty! - A novelty!

375
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,210
American lemonade, please? - Why American?

376
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,610
We serve no other sort. - Didn't I tell you...

377
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,100
He has an alarm-clock!

378
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,610
Allied agencies shouldn't keep secrets from one another!

379
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,780
Friendship has its limits.

380
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,340
Love alone is boundless.

381
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,490
Pssst!

382
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,420
The salt-cellar's been found! - Where?

383
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,220
Is this you agent?

384
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,610
Would Her Majesty's agent behave as he does?

385
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,820
But you know him?

386
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,210
You think this salt-cellar?

387
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,300
This is Edward.

388
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,490
Foustka... Joseph!

389
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,220
Cyril Juan Borquette didn't believe me that you're not Edward either

390
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,540
And he used to know him well.

391
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,730
They got the salt-cellar! - Salt-cellar!

392
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,730
He's swiped the salt-cellar! - He's swiped the salt-cellar!

393
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,820
Au devoir!

394
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,140
Two whiskies. Two... yes, sir.

395
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,420
Poison? - How old-fashioned!

396
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,220
A quarter for the telephone, please.

397
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,420
You're welcome

398
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,620
What brand is this? - Black and White.

399
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,210
I don't take Black and White - with plague-bacilli.

400
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,460
Quick, girls...

401
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,020
A small smile plays on my face

402
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,100
It's starting

403
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,620
hiding the sadness inside

404
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,020
But when the tears flow from my eyes

405
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,010
life feels sweet

406
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,220
A face of lies and deception

407
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,420
Stop playing! Start shooting! What?

408
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,010
That only a young girl can see

409
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,490
Roman one! Hmmm...

410
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,810
Roman one!

411
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,620
Thirteen what? Oh... 13B...

412
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,420
That you, Foustka?

413
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,420
Well, what is it?

414
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,810
You wanted any fuss or scandal -

415
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,980
to be avoided. Everything's all right.

416
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,210
That's why you had to wake me?

417
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,010
A young lady has mistaken me - for a man called Edward...

418
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,180
A former schoolmate of hers.

419
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,260
Did you ascertain - what the fellow is doing here?

420
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,780
Dancing, you say? Foustka, I'll strangle you!

421
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,290
Did you search his room?

422
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,410
He's got a room here? Hallo...

423
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,610
I wanted to add...

424
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,420
A small smile plays on my face

425
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,340
hiding the sadness inside

426
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,610
But when the tears flow from my eyes

427
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,810
life feels sweet

428
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,820
A face of lies and deception

429
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,020
that only a young girl can see

430
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:04,020
What are you doing here?

431
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,010
I am the Agent No 13.

432
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,020
One that will break the hearts of innocents in the world at large

433
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,100
Have a black coffee and go to bed!

434
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,020
And be careful next time! Understand?

435
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,020
I say... I really am a spy...

436
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,010
I used to laugh like other girls

437
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,220
but what a terrible mistake I made

438
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,610
A man enticed me to play a game

439
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:32,010
and then he broke my heart

440
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,020
Since that day I cry my tears

441
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,610
when others think to laugh

442
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,610
and laugh at times of sadness deep

443
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,220
which turns funerals into a farce

444
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,210
The last table by the door

445
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,010
the corner where they sit

446
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,410
when they've lost their faith in everything

447
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,610
and nothing more can be done

448
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,410
Reserve a spot for this brunette

449
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,010
who's been standing here for so long

450
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,210
so that she can turn her back on the world

451
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,410
and finally have a real good laugh

452
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,010
G sharp!

453
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,220
Target straight ahead

454
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,410
Stop this row at once! You don't know who I am!

455
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,900
Such a fine place and you...

456
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:13,610
Look at him!

457
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,620
Proceed, gentlemen.

458
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,620
Can't all this be settled in an amicable way?

459
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,620
That's what I think too!

460
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:42,010
Condemned by love to hope and dream

461
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,900
For which philanthropic agency are you working, Edward?

462
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,610
For town-cleaning.

463
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,700
Pydie, leave him alone!

464
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,620
Let's bygones be bygones...

465
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,700
worn out by desire, where will I find peace.

466
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,210
We shouldn't have taken this job.

467
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,010
Two whiskies.

468
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,020
Give me shadows, give me a drink

469
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,020
take the shackles from my arms

470
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,620
Number twenty three. Thank you. What's this, aha...

471
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,810
build a house above the swamp

472
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,690
Excuse me, but just in case you pocketed - something by mistake...

473
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,820
when mine went up in flames

474
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,010
Worn out by desire I still dream

475
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,220
Isn't he looking for a salt-cellar too? Let's go!

476
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:46,020
You were marvelous! Just as I expected.

477
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:49,810
Burnt by love, I draw your shadow to me...

478
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,810
Footsteps in W4C's room.

479
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,730
Search the room!

480
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,980
I don't know for what! He said search it, that's all.

481
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,420
Look at all these wires!

482
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,420
We must be near a laundry...

483
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,980
Footsteps in room 23.

484
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,620
Somebody walking there. Switch on!

485
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,420
Bugged by everyone except Greenland.

486
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,620
Pssst!

487
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,020
What about the mikes?

488
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,210
A jamming station!

489
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,610
Darn it!

490
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,210
Some defect!

491
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,410
More advanced technology will win every time.

492
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,410
Only human beings are irreplaceable!

493
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:24,020
The salt-cellar is practically mine now. - Certainly.

494
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,820
And the price?

495
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,620
It is worth a billion, but we'll leave all this to the agencies.

496
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,020
It had to be handed over- and we made

497
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,620
a quick job of it!

498
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,210
Such a lot of money! And I left it on the table.

499
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,980
I'd better take it to a safe place.

500
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,420
You can take it away now!

501
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,220
We have to get that salt-cellar!

502
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,820
Come on! Wait! Wait, I say!

503
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,410
Cyril, did you lock the door? - Nobody would dare to come in!

504
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:14,020
Ouch! - Sorry.

505
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:24,010
We got the wrong one! - You are just the right sort, anyhow!

506
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,540
It was exchanged for another salt-cellar. That's terrible!

507
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,740
No, it's wonderful!

508
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,060
Was it Edward?

509
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,690
The dog.

510
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,620
Yes, that dog Edward!

511
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:49,420
No. This dog. Doesn't it carry a bomb?

512
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,610
A biological weapon, don't you think?

513
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,970
A beautiful weapon don't you think? Cyril, what do you think?

514
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,460
I can't help loving animals. - A woman can be an animal too.

515
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,420
This isn't the luggage check!

516
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,010
Come here, Pydie...

517
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:47,010
We shouldn't have taken this job!

518
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,570
What time is it?

519
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,810
Don't... you might cause

520
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,850
a minor nuclear explosion!

521
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,610
Pssst!

522
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,770
Oh, please don't! The mikes didn't work and I...

523
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:23,610
so they just sent me to... no, no please don't...

524
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,810
I have a wife and children!

525
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:30,410
Your fault!

526
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:41,220
Love is always at variance with duty.

527
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:57,420
Good evening. Good...

528
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:11,020
Fie, Pydie! What have you got here?

529
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:18,010
Aren't you fosy! Which of them is it?

530
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,500
I can't tell...

531
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:51,010
Your bill.

532
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:55,420
I only had some lemonade. "And what does "dog" mean?"

533
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:59,740
Lemonade, whisky and the cloakroom ticket - for the dog.

534
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:03,820
Ninety two twenty. Hmmm, well...

535
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,410
Thank you, come again.

536
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,620
You can keep the change!

537
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:40,020
Will you open the door, please?

538
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,010
There's the back door!

539
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,020
Oh, I see... Come on!

540
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,210
Let's leave it till tomorrow. Go to sleep! - And you?

541
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:43,220
I'll look round for a bit.

542
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,340
What about the salt-cellar? - You'll get it at 11 a.m.

543
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:49,180
Why at eleven?

544
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:53,420
I am leaving at twelve - I'm having lunch in Casablanca.

545
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,610
Has anything happened here? - Nothing, I'm sorry to say!

546
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,620
What now? Let's try it over there...

547
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:03,650
Dammit... Not cleared up yet!

548
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,420
Come here! Come!

549
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:34,420
I feel a draught - it has to end here somewhere

550
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:45,010
...because you lost the salt-cellar and W4C is still alive!

551
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,410
If you don't make it right till twelve,

552
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:52,820
you'll have to swallow the red ball!

553
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:57,220
Listen well!

554
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:00,410
Firstly: W4C!

555
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,820
Secondly: Before

556
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,620
Alice Roberts dives,

557
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,010
the swimming pool has to be charged with 200.000 Volts.

558
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,020
200.000 Volts.

559
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,610
The body will be removed by a device made ready beforehand.

560
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,820
That girl know too much!

561
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,020
The cabin will be your command post.

562
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,020
Now - don't forget! - Nn - o!

563
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,020
You understood perfectly? - Yes.

564
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:36,420
Yes or no? - I said I understood.

565
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,010
I can only hear a whistling sound. It must be you mikes! ...Hear me?

566
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:43,100
Just a moment!

567
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,850
They were functioning all right...

568
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,810
I can hear you now!

569
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:56,010
Don't forget: Firstly and secondly!

570
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,980
Out! Hmmm...

571
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,460
What sort of a trap is this?

572
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,660
We've been here before...

573
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:38,420
Wait...

574
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:43,420
And we didn't notice this here! Now, run!

575
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:48,820
What's so precious about it? Don't sniff like that, there's a billion in that!

576
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:54,810
Where is it though?! We'll have to ask.

577
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,620
Up Pydie, up!

578
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:13,410
Hallo, Chief, will you please - give me some information about salt?

579
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:18,010
Foustka, the agent, speaking.

580
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:22,010
What's all that nonsense?

581
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:26,220
I told you I was a dietarian.

582
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:29,210
I'm not allowed to use salt.

583
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:32,410
That's why salt is double Dutch to me.

584
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:36,010
Dutch? I have a dictionary...

585
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:40,010
That fellow W4C told the young lady- it was worth a billion.

586
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,650
Which young lady?

587
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,820
The one they want to kill in the swimming pool tomorrow.

588
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:49,610
You gave me her photo...

589
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,620
You must prevent it!

590
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:55,410
We can't have ladies killed in our swimming-pools!

591
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:58,290
Think of our tourism!

592
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:01,420
I hold you responsible for the pool!

593
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,570
Got your regulation bathing-drawers? So what?!

594
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,620
I say, Chief... Hallo...

595
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,220
We shouldn't have taken the job, eh?

596
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:19,740
Swimmers, get ready!

597
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:37,420
When are you head-diving? - After the intermission. Why?

598
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:40,420
I want to see it! - And the salt-cellar?

599
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:43,500
At eleven, as I told you!

600
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,210
Your ticket!

601
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,770
Haven't got one. They're sold out.

602
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:08,820
Then stay out!

603
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,420
Pydie, try and make some confusion -

604
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:17,620
so I can sneak in!

605
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:32,420
Got it working? - Yes. 200.000 Volt.

606
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:41,210
You sure nobody's in the pool yet?

607
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:45,020
Well, you see

608
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:49,420
To your stations!

609
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,500
Everything O.K. Sir, as expected -

610
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:59,410
the stadium is full of people - the trouble is,

611
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:02,290
I can't get in.

612
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,970
There were no tickets to be got...

613
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:07,810
You bungler, you could have bought tickets

614
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,620
in advance! - Kindly remember, Chief...

615
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:13,980
Look up the directions - given in your booklet!

616
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:17,810
I did - paragraph 15- how to work one's way into the Headquarters.

617
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,620
Not a word about swimming-baths!

618
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:24,620
Get in through the conduit,

619
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:27,660
or disguised as the Mayor! Use your head, Foustka!

620
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:33,010
Use your head... Says he...

621
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:37,290
Disguised as the Mayor... I'd rather crawl in through the pipes!

622
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:52,020
Monsieur... well you're finally here let's go inside... sofort...

623
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,850
Your ticket! - Your ticket!

624
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,410
No use talking! Your ticket! - Got no ticket? Stay outside!

625
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:10,020
...the 100 metre breast stroke final

626
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:14,020
for this year's championship.

627
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:19,210
The lanes were drawn as follows

628
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:23,500
Starting block No 1 - Ron Wyler of New Zealand,

629
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:30,820
Block No 2 - Juan Alvarez, Ecuador...

630
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:35,220
Isn't that your Edward?

631
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:38,010
And he said he was a poor swimmer!

632
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:41,170
In Ecuador children start swimming at the age of three.

633
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:44,820
97,2% using the breast stroke and the back stroke, the rest.

634
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,460
You know everything, Juan!

635
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,220
About antique culture, for instance.

636
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:59,220
But I'm taking an interest in it. Excuse me.

637
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:12,090
Pydie! Bite... bite... bite!

638
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:21,020
Bite it through and then sick him!

639
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:52,220
Come in.

640
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:13,820
To your blocks!

641
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:44,420
...this inconspicuous Ecuadorian's stroke seems rather slow,

642
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:48,010
but you ought to see his legs under the surface...

643
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:40,210
The greatest surprise of this contest was the victory

644
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:44,410
of the Ecuadorian - Juan Alvarez, whose style...

645
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:47,250
Dear listeners, I can only say,

646
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:50,210
it was a really wonderful show.

647
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:53,300
We hope to get the champion to the microphone...

648
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,460
The diving competition will begin

649
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:19,580
with a double back-summersault executed by Miss Alice Roberts...

650
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,980
Will you, please - at this happy occasion - say a few words

651
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,090
to out listeners? We must prevent murder!

652
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:28,220
Bravo! Bravo! Dear listeners, this admirable Ecuadorian athlete -

653
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:31,420
the winner of the 100m race, in his finest sporting hour, not only

654
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:35,420
speaks good Czech, but he's also made an appeal for World Peace!

655
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:51,020
Hold this for me! - Right... Ladies and...

656
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,820
You won't!

657
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:05,090
What's bitten you, Edward?

658
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,090
Come down! You mustn't dive! The pool is charged with high voltage!

659
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:11,410
Take it easy, gentlemen! Let me prove it! Look!

660
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,810
The salt-cellar!

661
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:24,500
The salt-cellar!

662
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:28,260
At eleven sharp!

663
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:36,410
What's that?

664
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,420
Jesus Christ...

665
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:48,020
Dammit!

666
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:06,900
A different sound.

667
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:10,220
It's wet.

668
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:56,810
Step on it!

669
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:01,100
We must get him!

670
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:08,970
We can't allow that sort of thing here! You are disqualified!

671
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:12,740
Why? Good morning...

672
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,460
Come here, Pydie!

673
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:19,570
We shouldn't have taken this job!

674
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,660
This is yours. Wait a minute!

675
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:44,060
Faster! And to the left!

676
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:51,500
Take off your shoes!

677
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:55,020
They are indestructible.

678
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:58,260
I sometimes think, I haven't chosen a nice profession.

679
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:01,220
Oh, really?

680
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:19,580
Bon voyage, my boy...

681
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:57,340
Darling...

682
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:01,540
We gotta overtake him!

683
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:12,780
Three... Two... One... Go!

684
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:24,420
Eight minutes left for us.

685
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:27,500
Too short a time for lovers!

686
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:45,020
He's got away again!

687
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:07,620
You can choose!

688
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,410
Marie Novakova, Hongkong,

689
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:15,490
Marie Novakova, Hongkong, Marie Novakova, Hongkong...

690
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:24,420
Your passports, please!

691
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:33,020
The alarm clock! Fetch it!

692
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:42,100
Good doggie...

693
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:54,900
Hold this!

694
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:59,610
Interesting. And old timepiece - keeping bad time...

695
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:13,490
Hello, Edward. - Keeping bad time...

696
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:16,780
The alarm-clock, I mean. - I know, Edward.

697
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:21,780
No manners! - Thank you.

698
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:27,130
A window-seat on the right, please!

699
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:30,220
Not above the wing!

700
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:41,020
Juan!

701
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:08,580
Eat it!

702
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:19,620
A pool full of corpses!

703
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:26,620
W4C blown to kingdom come!

704
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:30,620
Foustka,

705
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:34,090
you've disrupted the whole European spy-network

706
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:37,220
You've destroyed the reason

707
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:40,210
for our existence!

708
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:44,420
That's as may be - but the young lady was saved.

709
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:07,410
And you bring me this stuff!

710
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:10,500
It's said to be worth a milliard!

711
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:13,620
A billion? - What am I to do with it?

712
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:16,780
It's beyond my planned revenue.

713
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:20,020
Which one is it? ...This one? - I'll soon know.

714
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:34,020
Edward, the salt-cellars!

715
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:39,610
Edu...

716
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:55,020
I'll return the brief-case, Edward.

717
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:10,810
There... the milliard is gone.

718
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:14,810
Couldn't you offer resistance?

719
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:18,220
This gimmick is out of order again!

720
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,620
Why didn't your bitch jump at her and worry her?

721
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:24,410
He was meant to jump on her and tear her to pieces! - He couldn't.

722
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,460
What do you mean he couldn't? - Holding the salt-cellar in his mouth.

723
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:30,730
Which salt-cellar? - The right one.

724
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:34,010
Pydie, let him have it!

725
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:40,010
Foustka!..

726
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:44,810
Let me hug you!

727
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:49,010
Now it's functioning!

728
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:56,890
Mr. Foustka, why did that woman call you Edward?

729
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:59,970
She was mistaking me for a schoolmate of hers.

730
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:04,820
And... do you... know her intimately?

731
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,660
Well...

732
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:20,740
Mr. Foustka,

733
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:24,220
this is most valuable indeed!

734
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:27,620
It really is a plan for the military utilizations of Venus.

735
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:32,620
You'll be promoted from Agent 13B

736
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:36,650
to... Agent 13A!

737
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:40,980
Pydie, here boy

738
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:44,140
We shouldn't have taken this job.

739
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:47,220
Why, Mr. Foustka?

740
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:50,410
He said I'd be appointed Chief accountant - didn't he?

741
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:53,620
And now an agent again, right?

742
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:02,140
The end
