1
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,200
The Parson's End 

2
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35, 920
Step right up, ladies and 
gentlemen,

3
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,176
A show to top all shows,

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,800
A drama of passion and love,
Love and passion...

5
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,500
Enough of that, girls.
Get going and sing!

6
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,000
<i>Thirteen outlaws stabbed 
a lord,</i>

7
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,380
<i>The blood flowed red 
around the sword,</i>

8
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,000
Where are the actors? He 
always shows the actors!

10
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
Get into your costumes!

11
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,138
As for acting,

12
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,588
Friends, acting must be done 
with feeling, with sincerity.

13
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,800
For example, when I laugh, 
I mean it! See?

14
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,600
And when I cry.

15
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
It's with feeling naturally.

16
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,500
You there. Look natural.

17
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
That's it, exactly.

18
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:02,050
...love and passion, that's 
the fashion.

19
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04.850
The maiden Anna, sweet as mama,

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,850
loved her Tony, brave and brawney.

21
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,200
You mean I wear this?

22
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:10,999
Shut up!

23
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,800
The boss knows what he's doing!

24
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,430
Anna's folk approve.

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,600
They don't know he's not so smart

26
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,950
That he's fallen for Majka.

27
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,000
The local tart.

28
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,050
Who are all these people?

29
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,000
What are they doing here?

30
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,400
Oh, those are only observers 
and advisers.

31
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,010
What?

32
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,700
They're going to check whether 
we have fun.

33
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,000
<i>The blood flowed red 
around the sword.</i>

34
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,450
Everything is absolutely true 
to life and absolutely fictional.

35
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,400
You'll see a teacher scrape and smile
and hide his free mind all the while.

36
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,400
Just make sure it's clean.

37
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,190
There are children around.

38
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,750
People ought to love each other.

39
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,200
On the other hand, don't go easy 
on anyone who doesn't deserve it.

40
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,800
Okay, so we'll toss a preacher 
in, right?

41
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,500
Far away in a distant land dwelt
a solitary man

42
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,700
Who was to save them all.

43
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:11,800
Little does he know,

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,600
what God has prepared for him.

45
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,700
Bless you, Father, our little 
one here...

46
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,600
Father, don't run away. Would 
you give him...

47
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,300
The sacrement of Holy Baptism? 
Sorry. Granny, but the priest 
is out...

48
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,578
That's all right, you'll do as 
well as anybody, Sexton.

49
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,515
But really, I can't. You'll 
have to wait for the priest.

50
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,200
But what if the good Lord
calls him before then?

51
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,646
You, say something, tell the 
Father why...

52
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,200
That's the child's father?

53
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,700
Lordy, no, she don't even 
know who the father is.

54
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,800
Please, Father, please...

55
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,916
Well...well..Go on into the 
baptistry.

56
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,999
God bless you, Father.

57
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,900
If only we had you back home.

58
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,358
Our parsonage has been empty 
for years.

59
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,494
Listen to him yell...and a while 
ago I  thought we'd lose him.

60
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,380
Give him a drink!

61
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How can I, Grandma?

62
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
You should have been ashamed 
in the first place!

63
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,888
The Father won't watch.

64
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,000
He's drinking!

65
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,320
Is he?

66
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,600
Just a minute, Father.

67
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Couldn't you come for our 
patron Saint's day?

68
00:08,08.074 --> 00:08,10,800
So we could go to mass in 
our own village church?

69
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,400
God bless you, Granny.

70
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,616
Make it snappy, the wedding 
party's due.

71
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,900
Did you give the altar boys 
clean robes?

72
00:08:47,000--> 00:08:48,500
Yes, Father.

73
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:21,000
What's that?

74
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,546
He asks if you are the sexton.

75
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,000
What's he saying?

76
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,300
Let him finish.

77
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh what?

78
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,500
You're to line them up for 
the ceremony.

79
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,550
The master of ceremonies is drunk.

80
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,200
The mademoiselle here...and you 
come here...

81
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,500
there you are...
the sea-sick gentleman...

82
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,520
Up you go...

83
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,778
The mother of the groom...

84
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,700
...and the bride stands by 
the groom...

85
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,530
Hurry up, make it snappy.

86
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,951
Dearly beloved...

87
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,800
I don't want to mary him!

88
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,475
I'm not the bride, my mother is!

89
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,550
The sexton misunderstood!

90
00:11:05,324 --> 00:11:06,800
The sexton?!

91
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,100
All's well that ends well.

92
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:31,200
Here, Father, for christening 
the baby.

93
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,800
What am I to do with it?

94
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,100
Take it, Father, please.

95
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,100
Well, Ma, what do you say?

96
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,800
Are we a happy family or 
aren't we?

97
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:17,850
And what the hell is eating you?
Why don't you talk to her?

98
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,100
Isn't she your girl?

99
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,200
This will kill you, Louie. 
Down the hatch!

100
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,700
Just so he doesn't pass out on us.

101
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,577
He can take it, teacher boy.

102
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,200
This is what our whole life 
will be like someday.

103
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12;44,000
Just one big happy celebration!

104
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:48,600
That public address system I 
had installed.

105
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,746
A sign of prosperity, culture,

106
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,361
and people will love each other.

107
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,306
Except for Louie here, he's 
an anachronism.

108
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,622
I mean, our society has 
eliminated hobos.

109
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,876
We ought to find him a job.

110
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,591
He's no good at anything, 
but getting drunk.

111
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,075
Make sure they're good and 
greasy!

112
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,200
Granny, here, since you 
can't come down.

113
00:13:38:,200 -->00:13:42,766
Come here. What's up down there?
Everyone's having fun, ain't they?

114
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:47,800
But I've got to go.

115
00:13:48,348 --> 00:13:50,010
Wait a minute, sugar.

116
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:52,675
Nobody's ever got time for me.

117
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,147
You keep stuffing me like a pig.

118
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,147
Go to hell with your damn food.

119
00:13:58,349 --> 00:14:01,461
I want some company.

120
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,420
And what is your main subject?

121
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,462
The problem of commitment in art.

122
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:14,000
An esoteric question, true,

123
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:22,430
but a complex of phenomena
integrated with creative activity.

124
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,386
Avant garde trends...

125
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:27,724
Say, teacher, that PA system is 
really something!

126
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,000
Yes, it will really be fine.

127
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,900
People really ought to love 
each other.

128
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,976
Are they taking him to the pigsty?

129
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,900
When he comes to, he'll wind up
in the haystack.

130
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,800
Do you know how many drunks have
burned to death in haystacks?

131
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,843
No great loss if Louie should 
catch fire.

132
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,888
True - but he is a human being 
all the same.

133
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,068
Beautiful music, isn't it?

134
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,274
Granny wants you to come up 
and see her.

135
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,915
All right, later. After I get 
my work taken care of.

136
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,000
Here, give her something to 
elevate her mind.

137
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,180
And this, John, is for you.

138
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,949
Very intereting, most educational.

139
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:22,800
Why do you keep giving him books?
He's the town idiot.

140
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,800
John Christian is actually very
interested in scientific atheism.

141
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,150
In who?

142
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,340
The belief that there is no God.

143
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,000
You mean, like, Johnny's an 
atheist?

144
00:17:56,178 --> 00:17:58,500
<i>My book about God.</i>

145
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01, 800
<i>Religion - the un-scientific 
belief of the past.</i>

146
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,514
<i>And she brought forth her 
firstborn son</i>

147
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:30,120
<i>and wrapped him in 
swaddling clothes</i>

148
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,400
<i>and laid him in a manger.</i>

149
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,200
Where's Tonik?

150
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,484
Am I his keeper?

151
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,927
Tonik! Where are you?

152
00:20:14,064 --> 00:20:16,950
<i>...as it is written...</i>

153
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,010
<i>...behold, thy King 
cometh,</i>

154
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,099
<i>sitting on an ass.</i>

155
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,800
What's the matter, Granny?

156
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,361
What's going on down there?

157
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,418
They're just having fun.

158
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,999
Fun!

159
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,336
I'll bring your dinner.

160
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,900
At half past four?

161
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,100
I'll be busy later on.

162
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:51,722
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

163
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,800
Help! Help! I'm dying!

164
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,100
What's the matter, Granny?

165
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,641
I'm dying! Help!

166
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,000
It must have been the sausage.

167
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,389
I'll call the teacher.

168
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,600
How far is it to the next 
village, son?

169
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,500
Who...who are you?

170
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,247
The new priest.

171
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,145
We never had a priest.

172
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,325
Now you do, son.

173
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,999
Where does it hurt, Granny?

174
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:49,600
Everywhere, everyplace, 
teacher boy!

175
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,750
And nobody to talk to...

176
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,243
You want a bite to eat?

177
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:11,563
Me here dying, and she says eat!

178
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,503
The last rites, if anything.

179
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,150
How about a doctor?

180
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,450
God bless you, my children.

181
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,100
Oh, Father, you're a Godsend!

182
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,900
You've got to give me the 
last rites.

183
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,999
You aren't serious, Granny!

184
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:39,750
When a body's at death's door,
everything's serious.

185
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,766
The last rites is something 
precious.

186
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,240
You really need it?

187
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,350
I haven't been to confession 
for years!

188
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,650
You wouldn't condemn me to...

189
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,300
Granny, you've been flat on 
your back all those years.

190
00:24:13,015 --> 00:24:14,495
But I sinned anyway...

191
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,006
in thought and word.

192
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,750
The last rites is a holy matter.

193
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,450
Wouldn't it do if we said a 
prayer together?

194
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,830
You think it'd help?

195
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,115
The power of sincere prayer 
is immense.

196
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,100
Don't take it so hard, teacher.
She does it to be on the safe side.

197
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,147
You'd better send for the doctor.

198
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,200
Saddle a horse, this time of day?

199
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:53,402
See, John, the deep roots of
superstition?

200
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:09,600
Children, neighbors! I'm not 
dying anymore!

201
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,900
The power of sincere prayer.

202
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,531
I call it the power of...
suggestion.

203
00:25:21,075 --> 00:25:22,350
Where's the priest?

204
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,050
Somebody said there's a priest!

205
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,700
I - I want to confess my sins.

206
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm a sinner, God, I'm a sinner.

207
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,850
You said it buddy!

208
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,900
I have to reform.

209
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,300
It's been here for years. It's 
yours, it's too small for me.

210
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,400
No friends, I can't stay, really.

211
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,050
It doesn't look like much. But 
we'll fix it up for you.

212
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,050
Lovely village. Everyone so 
busy...

213
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Yes, we are improving things.

214
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,765
But it's all for our happy future.

215
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,518
And for the people, mainly for 
the people.

216
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,200
Because the people are against, 
I mean, with us.

217
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,100
Truely lovely.

218
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,300
Help!

219
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,700
Never a dull moment.

220
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,332
The church here is better than 
in the next village.

221
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,900
Stay here, Father. We really 
need you.

222
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,750
But friends, I was headed for the 
next village.

223
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,700
See? The Father was headed for...

224
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,500
Stay with us, Father. Surely, 
it's all the same.

225
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,200
We've been needing you...

226
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,324
...weddings, funerals, 
christenings...

227
00:27:12,907 --> 00:27:14,750
...instead of the teacher just
registering them in the book.

228
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,800
If you get the urge at night,

229
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,930
you won't have to go to the church.

230
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,800
We all need to improve 
ourselves, badly.

231
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,200
And if you need anything, holler.

232
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,822
I'll put some flowers on the altar.

233
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,250
What's up? Where is everybody?

234
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,300
In chruch. Singing.

235
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,010
In church?

236
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,850
And you? Did you do your homework?

237
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,750
Well, how much is six times five?

238
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,650
Six times five is...is

239
00:28:33,600 --> 0:28:35,585
This is impossible. You'll fail.

240
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:42,329
Even God won't help you pass, 
if you go on like this.

241
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,970
Sit down!

242
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,800
I don't know...

243
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:03,914
Saint Wenceslas, prince of 
Bohemia...

244
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:41,900
Your hat!

245
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:55,569
I see you're hard at work. 
Fine, fine.

246
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:02,250
You know, I always say that 
above all, we need culture.

247
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,650
Naturally, I don't mean 
superstition. God forbid, not that.

248
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:12,500
I'm opposed to superstition myself.
I stick to the faith instead.

249
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,750
I knew we'd get along.

250
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,289
People ought to love each other.

251
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,720
On the one hand, I'm an atheist...

252
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,250
On the other, a little religion 
can't hurt.

253
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,900
It refines our sensibilities.

254
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,150
What would the future be without 
sensibility?

255
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,149
An emotionless future is no future.

256
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,600
That singing is lovely.

257
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,200
Yes, aside from its significance,
liturgy has its poetry as well.

258
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,900
Poetry, that's it, stick to poetry.

259
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,600
I mean, you'd better stick to 
the church.

260
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,150
I'll take care of civil matters.

261
0:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,900
I'm a clergyman. Worldly matters
are not my affair.

262
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,800
Father, the children especially.

263
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,060
I was always interested in 
the future, above all.

264
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,400 
And that means children.

265
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,589
And I'll take care of them, too.

266
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,150
What is it, my good man?

267
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,200 
I want to go to confession.

268
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,300
They called it an inflammation 
at the hospital.

269
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,800
I know the urologist there...

270
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,500
Father, I've sinned, every day.

271
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,419
With the baker, the blacksmith, 
and two I don't even know.

272
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,950
Once, or frequently?

273
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,052
Lots of times. But I deeply 
repent...

274
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,400
Where is he going?

275
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,250
Mother told me to come and say I've
committed the seven mortal sins

276
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,350
I was lazy, proud,avaricious,
envious and immoral.

277
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,850
Look, son, tell your mother I'll
hear your confession some other time.

278
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,800
Aren't you feeling well, Father?

279
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,250
No, my dear friend.

280
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,500
It's just that the cup of 
bitterness sometimes overfloweth.

281
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,750
Look, Father, what I brought you.

282
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,680
The Savior's eyes follow you 
everywhere.

283
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,700
What happened?

284
00:33:41,472 --> 00:33:44,010
They used to do arithmetic
and now it's soccer.

285
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:50,350
They ought to teach them to 
be good...not rougnecks.

286
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,900
We've got the Father, to keep 
their soul heatlhy.

287
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,650
Leave their souls out of it!

288
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:08,723
Father, I'm a music lover myself,
but the children are my affair.

289
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,999
They come here on their own. They 
say they have civics in school 
instead of music.

290
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,350
That's a lie!

291
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,250
Sometimes they had theory, and 
they didn't like that,

292
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,020
and I don't have an ear 
for music...

293
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,400
Well, really...

294
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,600
See? Do you want me to teach 
them to sing off-key?

295
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,078
You and me, we want 
the same thing.

296
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:56,500
for people to love each other,
help each other.

297
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,550
Our opinions differ only in 
details.

298
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,800
What details?

299
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,900
Like is there or isn't there 
a God.

300
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,150
So why shouldn't we help 
each other?

301
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:12,450
I'm all for it. I just won't 
back down on my principles.

302
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,213
Naturally! Principles are 
principles!

303
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,850
But look at it from the 
philosophical viewpoint.

304
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,300
I work with children on the
verge of adulthood.

305
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,890
Whereas you work with their 
elders,

306
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,860
on the verge of death.

307
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,600
Yes. We are all on the verge 
of the same thing.

308
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,400
Yes. The future.

309
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,800
Yes. Death.

310
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,450
Forever and ever, amen.

311
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,683
You look down at the mouth, 
Father.

312
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,350
You don't get much rest, 
do you?

313
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,150
Blackjack.

314
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,650
Don't waste the sign of the cross.

315
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,850,
As long as I've got you.
Nobody gives a shit for me anyway.

316
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,182
Twenty.

317
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,324
Even God won't help you.

318
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:37,100
Twenty-one!

319
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,350
Damn it, who taught you to 
play blackjack?

320
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:43,075
Johnny will have to run to 
get some more pennies.

321
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:57,500
Now the preacher can polish his 
crucifix till he's blue in the face.

322
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,984
Where will we put it when it rains?

323
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,500
Let's move the criminals from
the pigsty to the woodshed.

324
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,750
That's none of my business. Talk it
over with the police force here.

325
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,999
And now we'll play for the TV set.

326
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,999
Not that, Granny.

327
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,300
They only show a bunch of 
bullshit anyway on TV.

328
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,650
Granny, that's too much.

329
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:52,832
Take it back. I don't believe in
getting rich gambling. I'm a preist.

330
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,033
A swell priest you are.

331
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,178
Priests like you are few and 
far between.

332
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,500
I wasn't always a priest.

333
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,450
You're a reformed sinner?

334
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,200
That's why you're so 
understanding.

335
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:23,750
Didn't Jesus say that one 
reformed sinner

336
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,273
meant more to him than ten 
righteous men?

337
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,150
Did he say that?

338
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,600
Sure. Don't you read 
your bible?

339
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,010
Of course. Daily, Granny.

340
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,600
Well, Granny, I've finally 
found some time.

341
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,600
Why aren't you watching TV?

342
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,450
Is it broken? Let's see. 
Without it...

343
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,999
You're completely cut off from
the world, Granny.

344
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,850
The TV works, but my eyes aren't
worth a shit, teacher boy.

345
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,400
I should stand you in the 
corner for that word.

346
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,250
Bullshit.

347
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,200
Granny, really now!

348
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:33,150
There is so much vulgarity 
these days.

349
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,200
And yet we were never better
off than today.

350
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,800
Were we ever better off, Granny?

351
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,999
Nope.

352
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,500
See? And yet you keep carrying on
this way...

353
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,060
At least listen to the most 
important news.

354
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,650
The government met in session 
and resolved...

355
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,800
Are you asleep?

356
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:07,450
Granny, the govenment...are 
you asleep?

357
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,050
No, I'm no. I'm thinking.

358
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,200
How about a little game?

359
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,500
Good idea. Chess?

360
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,850
Fine game. Sharpens the wits.

361
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,200
I don't need 'em sharp. 
I need some fun.

362
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,800
That's it. There's eight times 
eight squares.

363
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,700
Black, white, black...

364
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,150
And now the chessmen. 
This is the pawn.

365
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,900
The working class of chess 
and the most important.

366
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:35,992
With people like you, friends,
everything is possible.

367
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,429
Your lives aren't easy.

368
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,917
Your callosed hands feed millions,

369
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,035
and yet there is enough to spare to
buy a splendid machine like this.

370
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,908
You might ask, why a fire truck?

371
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,831
True, we've done away with fires.

372
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,677
But it will serve as a warning

373
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,716
to anyone who might want to 
cause a fire.

374
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:17,717
People ought to love each other
and not cause fires.

375
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,997
Under the rule of this beautiful
fire engine.

376
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,797
We will never have another fire 
in our village.

377
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,589
Fire! Fire!

378
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,918
Water pressure must be low.

379
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,712
Nonsense. New-fangled nonsense.

380
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,560
Buckets were fine when I was a girl.

381
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,660
Should we go get the buckets?

382
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,990
Nonsense. Don't panic. Everything is 
under control. We have a fire truck.

383
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,000
What should we do, Father?

384
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,036
Pray.

385
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,559
There's no depending on anything
these days.

386
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,031
A miracle. It squirts!

387
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,468
The good Lord sent us a miracle!

388
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,512
But the hottest of flames, friends,

389
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,031
are the flames of sin in your hearts.

390
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,957
When I see that the best of 
you are no

391
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,392
better than thieves and adulterers,

392
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,111
I am sad.

393
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,393
Where are your resolutions?

394
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,229
Your promises to atone?

395
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,836
Words, words, words.

396
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,757
I ask myself, what makes people 
submit to temptation 
again and again?

397
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,592
I look at myself and I know.

398
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,997
People behave as if being human
meant having privileges only.

399
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,439
Being human means, above all, 
having duties.

400
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,672
Not to be prideful,

401
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,157
but humble, helpful and modest.

402
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,197
So let us repent and pray to God.

403
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,960
God, punish me, I am a sinner.

404
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,834
It's a blessed land, John.

405
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,435
Especially since you came, Father.

406
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,799
You're a good boy, John, like
John the disciple.

407
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,716
I know you're fond of me.

408
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,310
You know, I never knew how much
a pastor means to his sheep.

409
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,639
I'd like to be a real priest. 
A proper one.

410
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,837
But you are!

411
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,673
I'm not, John.

412
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:47,273
I know. You're actually more 
than a proper priest.

413
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,800
Reverend Father, 
can you spare a moment?

414
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53,514
I've mass to serve at ten in 
the next village.

415
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,156
Your believers are patient. 
They'll wait.

416
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,878
I'm in favor of a dialogue, Father,

417
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,378
but not if you're always ahead.

418
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,900
You must admit that this is a threat
to my privileged postion in the village.

419
00:47:15,075 --> 00:47:16,500
Dialogue has to be useful.

420
00:47:17,000 --> 00:7:18,075
To whom?

421
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,999
Whom? All of us, of course.

422
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,317
Do you know of anything useful
to everyone?

423
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,794
What?

424
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,112
What? Eh? Anything that our 
town council decides.

425
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,634
It represents us and decides for us,

426
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,295
and there is nothing more perfect,

427
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,549
than our town council.

428
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,300
There is nothing more perfect 
than man.

429
00:47:38,075 --> 00:47:40,800
Nothing more imperfect. Don't 
you believe that in man?

430
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:46,311
Man has his faults, but in 
essence, man is good.

431
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,956
Man is, in essence, evil. 
He only has his good attributes.

432
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,637
See? I told you we agree.

433
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:01,552
So why shouldn't we lead the village,
hand in hand towards the happy future?

434
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,469
<i>...the devil taketh him up 
unto an accordingly high mountain,<i>

435
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,752
<i>and showeth him all the 
kingdoms of the world...</i>

436
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:23,457
<i>and said,'All this will I 
give Thee if thou will kneel 
and worship me,'</i>

437
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,318
What I mean, Father, is that 
I'm all for dialogue,

438
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:33,269
if you recognize my leading 
position in the village.

439
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,434
It's a fact anyway, there's 
no changing it.

440
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:46,833
If we agree, Father, you 
won't be badly off yourself.

441
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,117
I leave it all in the hands 
of God.

442
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,736
A man in uniform steps in.

443
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,575
Strict with the poor man 
and his kin.

444
00:49:15,075 --> 00:49:17,273
With the brass buttons of 
the sentry,

445
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,028
Damn pigs! Somebody's going 
to break his neck one day.

446
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,800
Are you hurt, man?

447
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,990
Let me smell your breath.

448
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,800
You've been drinking, sir!

449
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,992
Heavens, no.

450
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,556
It was the Blood of the Lord.

451
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,119
See the pretty color you made?

452
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,231
All right come with us.

453
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,877
Lord, no, no...

454
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,631
<i>His lungs are shot, his 
guts are torn.</i>

455
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,474
<i>His eyes have ceased to 
wiggle,</i>

456
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,389
<i>...hear the outlaws 
giggle.</i>

457
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,399
Those piges are a public nuisance. 
We'll have to do something 
about them.

458
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,557
We'll discuss it.

459
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,670
<i>...hear the outlaws giggle.</i>

460
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,872
Who's in favor?

461
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,839
<i>...hear the outlaws 
giggle.</i>

462
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,511
All right, old boy, all right.

463
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,313
Amnesty! Amnesty!

464
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,557
The town council is setting 
you free.

465
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,554
Since it's the patron saint's 
day.

466
00:51:51,999 --> 00:51:55,759
I wonder, isn't releasing 
criminals a bit premature?

467
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,152
The sooner we'll catch them 
again.

468
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,278
Where are you going? Halt!

469
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,272
So you insist you haven't 
been drinking?

470
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,597
But my nose knows.

471
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,598
At least two quarts!

472
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,435
Some things are beyond your 
nose, sir.

473
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,035
Like transubstantiation.

474
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,575
Trans...who?

475
00:52:31,999 --> 00:52:33,392
Transubstantiation.

476
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,316
Look you, cut that out...
that kind of language.

477
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:42,156
It won't go you any good.

478
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,230
That's right. 
You've been drinking!

479
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,434
But I drank the 
Blood of the Lord.

480
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,555
You can think you drink 
anything you want.

481
00:52:54,075 --> 00:52:57,750
As for me, you drank wine, and we 
don't recognize any blood of the Lord.

482
00:52:58,075 --> 00:52:59,469
But we do. Our law does!

483
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,474
What law? Our law recognizes no
such nonsense.

484
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,830
According to the law of the Chruch,

485
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:09,590
wine turns into blood.

486
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,594
We'd be the first to know if 
the law transforms anything.

487
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:18,231
That's right. If something has alcohol
in it, it an alcoholic beverage.

488
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,100
But the laws of our state...

489
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,478
Get out!

490
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,300
Easy boss.

491
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,756
I'll show you, you and your laws!

492
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,731
He always squirms out of 
everything.

493
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,431
Never mind, 
we've got our eye on him.

494
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,113
You work too hard. That's why 
your head aches.

495
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,315
I like my work, John.

496
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,918
But giving out the Holy Sacrament
is too much for me - 

497
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,712
You are so pious, 
so deeply religious.

498
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,396
But you have to go now.

499
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,950
-Must I?
-You must.

500
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,795
All right, but first take 
that painting to the rectory.

501
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,992
Dearly beloved.

502
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,033
The promise of matrimony is 
binding and permanent.

503
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:51,474
There is still plenty of
time to reconsider.

504
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,038
Do you want to think it over?

505
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,954
And so I ask you before God.

506
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,633
Anna, do you take Tonik to be your
lawful husband of your own free will?

507
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,991
I do.

508
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,235
And I ask you, Tonik, 
do you take Anna

509
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:35,032
to be your true and faithful wife
of your own free will?

510
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,250
Tonik, you're drinking too much.

511
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,235
Leave me be!

512
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,610
The Father is the smartest. He 
doesn't have to worry about 
getting hooked.

513
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,833
Is this a wedding or a funernal?

514
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:22,513
Or take the teacher here. How did
you manage so long without women?

515
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,672
Hard to tell.

516
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,515
Can't say I wasn't lonesome 
sometimes.

517
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,317
What's the matter? Is there 
anything  I can do for you?

518
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,791
God bless you one and all.

519
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,800
I don't know that your condition

520
00:56:55,075 --> 00:56:56,709
is the right one to be 
calling on God.

521
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,118
Even a saint sins seven 
times daily.

522
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,556
But you're far from sainthood.

523
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,757
But I only sin once..from 
morning to night.

524
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,670
<i>The Lord is my Shepherd,</i>

525
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,553
<i>I shall not want...</i>

526
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:26,190
<i>...in green pastures, 
He leadeth me...</i>

527
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:38,798
As for doing away with sin, 
you're not doing so well.

528
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:44,628
I try at least to be compassionate.
I help wherever I can.

529
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,155
And what about me?

530
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:54,711
From the public address system, 
to the fire truck...

531
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,352
I do what I can.

532
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,075
I work and slave and 
drink only water,

533
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,431
and yet people don't...

534
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,038
Maybe because you do too much
for everybody.

535
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,832
Try doing something for just
one person once.

536
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,678
Father, I'm unhappy.

537
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,395
Tonik - are you hurt?

538
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,150
But Tonik, you're married!

539
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,270
The others were too.

540
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,516
But with you, it's different.

541
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,470
Tonik, are you in there?

542
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,312
Please, Majka...

543
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,030
God, you're drunk.

544
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,512
Cut that out.

545
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,033
Let go of me!

546
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,800
Turn him loose!

547
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,998
You slut! You whore!

548
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,474
I'll kill you!

549
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,831
Leave Grandma's veil alone!

550
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,151
I hate you, you bitch!

551
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,630
Why the vulgarity?

552
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:57,800
Can't they say it without 
words like that?

553
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,597
You flithy whore. I'll show you!

554
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:14,876
Damn it, where is everybody?

555
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,830
Are you all drunk already?
And it's only five o'clock.

556
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,996
Aren't you ashamed, Mary Magdalene?
Tempting a married man?

557
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,800
It was him, not me!

558
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,550
A kick in the behind is what 
she needs.

559
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,951
Where is the priest?

560
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,078
What do you think, Father?

561
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:28,560
<i>...and when they had set her in 
the midst he said unto them...</i>

562
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:36,278
He that is without sin among you,
let him cast the first stone.

563
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,999
Go and sin no more.

564
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,514
Can you spare me a moment, Father?

565
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,474
Excuse me. I know that people ought 
to love one another.

566
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,599
This is a question of justice.

567
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,750
How about the poor girls who
wouldn't dream of...

568
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,829
...at least not as openly.

569
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:36,830
Not for our deeds, but by your
mercy, forgive us, Lord

570
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,075
No. This is too much.

571
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:42,300
If you think that choir singing and 

572
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,553
altar boy-ing will teach you 
arithmetic,

573
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,514
you're wrong. Wrong.

574
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,392
God won't save you, Jude.

575
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,400
I know, there is no God.

576
01:03:58,075 --> 01:03:59,355
Only one thing can save you.

577
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,993
- I'll study well, now -
- That won't help you either.

578
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:11,712
I'm going to talk to Jude in the hall.
I want it perfectly quiet in here!

579
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,153
Kokes, you're in charge.

580
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:24,670
Quit bawling. 
You've one more chance.

581
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,320
When will you be back, Father?

582
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:03,513
I don't know, John. I may 
be transferred to another parish.

583
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:08,312
They can't. You stil have a 
mission here.

584
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,478
Mission?

585
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,233
I go where God sends me.

586
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,308
Good morning, Father.

587
01:05:22,075 --> 01:05:24,112
God bless you, son. What is it?

588
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,273
What did you tell the Reverend 
Father?

589
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,630
What did you tell him?

590
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,832
That Majka said for him to 
come to the haystack.

591
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,590
Who told you to say that?

592
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:55,232
Aren't you ashamed, picking 
on a little boy?

593
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,900
God bless you, Father.

594
01:06:06,675 --> 01:06:08,394
God bless you, Majka. What 
is it?

595
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,278
What? I don't know.

596
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,375
You wanted to see me.

597
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,355
I always want to see you.

598
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,359
I was so ashamed. You must 
think I'm awful.

599
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,511
We're all sinners.

600
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,637
We all need forgiveness.

601
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,636
The Father is in the haystack 
with Majka!

602
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,879
When I confessed it to you, 
I felt better.

603
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,476
I know. Majka. I understand.

604
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,873
Reverent Father!
Run! Run! Run!

605
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,878
She tricked you into coming and
now the whole village is after you!

606
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,196
Jesus, that's a lie!

607
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,914
Honest, Father, 
it isn't the truth.

608
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,713
Father, it's not true!

609
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,315
Come on out!

610
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,313
Majka, Father!

611
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,518
They are in there!

612
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,070
We know you're there.

613
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,351
Your flock wants to talk to you.

614
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,800
Fire! Fire!

615
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,551
Run everybody!

616
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,072
Let's get out of here. Fire!

617
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,191
It isn't true, Father, I didn't...

618
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,637
It's isn't true, Father.

619
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,470
What's going on?

620
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:38,231
I don't know, Granny. 
Fire, I suppose.

621
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:42,275
Fire, what the hell. Let it burn.

622
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,632
Here's Grandpa. I'll put him
back again when you're through.

623
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,750
I wonder if he'll recognize me,

624
01:08:49,075 --> 01:08:51,157
up in heaven?

625
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:55,600
What kind of nonsense is that?

626
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:59,914
No nonsense, sugar. 
It's pretty bad.

627
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,840
If only the Reverend Father 
was here.

628
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,593
God knows what they were really
doing in here.

629
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,110
Maybe she has sung her catechism
with him.

630
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,549
Find anything?

631
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,392
Still nothing?

632
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,516
Nothing.

633
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,712
They must have burned to death.

634
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,875
This shouldn't have happened.

635
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:40,633
No one wanted this to happen.

636
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:46,678
Poor girl, she was good to 
everybody who asked her.

637
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:51,276
They could have even gotten married,
if it weren't for the church.

638
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,598
Here he is. Alone.

639
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,309
Why was he alone?

640
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,917
<i>His lung are shot, his guts 
are torn.</i>

641
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,200
<i>His eyes have ceased to 
wiggle,</i>

642
01:11:16,999 --> 01:11:19,591
<i>hear the outlaws giggle.</i>

643
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,394
What's all this about. Out!

644
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,850
Two distinguished gentleman 
of the cloth,

645
01:11:26,075 --> 01:11:28,336
white-skinned, black-skinned, 
bishops both.

646
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,671
Instruments of heaven's might.

647
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,631
Arrive in a carrage in the night.

648
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,754
Have you seen the Reverend Father?

649
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,635
The Reverend Father!

650
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:28,037
Impossible!

651
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,550
Reverend Father! A miracle!

652
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,469
Where are you going?

653
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,513
I have to leave, friends. 
I'm called away.

654
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,239
Father Granny is calling you.

655
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,677
She's really in a bad way.

656
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:45,077
You have to come to her!

657
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:55,550
And who is this, then?

658
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,959
Louie the vagabond!

659
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,193
Louie! Louie the vagabond! It was
Louie the vagabond!

660
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,797
What was it you were saying brat?

661
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:09,579
Making up stories about the
Reverend Father?

662
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,151
It wasn't my idea!

663
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,072
Whose was it?

664
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,628
Teacher, the Reverend Father 
is alive!

665
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,877
Thank God! It wasn't him!

666
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,838
You see where alcohol can lead
neighbors!

667
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:47,100
Such a promising fellow, and 
see what drink has done!

668
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,668
Oh it hurts...

669
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:02,835
Oh Father, oh Father.

670
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,718
And wouldn't a little prayer 
do again?

671
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,359
No, Father, not this time.

672
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:32,436
I was faking that last time.

673
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:39,075
- Faking?
- That's right. But this time, 
  it's bad.

674
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:47,536
Give me the last rites, Father.
Please, Father, please...

675
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,437
John, how long would it take 
to get the deacon from town?

676
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:00,478
Father please, don't 
leave me alone.

677
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,217
You remind me of somebody.

678
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:09,700
a little of my old man,

679
01:15:10,075 --> 01:15:12,514
and a little of Jesus.

680
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,876
It must be that Jewish 
face of yours.

681
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:24,397
Please, Father...

682
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,436
Stay here, light the candles. 

683
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:21,635
Unfortunately, the church 
here is unoccupied.

684
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,514
We have so few priests.

685
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,230
Oh, we have enough of them.

686
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,237
Do you hear an organ playing?

687
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,469
I hear it, but I don't 
understand.

688
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,471
I really don't understand.

689
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:03,719
Perhaps my chauffeur stopped 
at the wrong village.

690
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,554
Incredible!

691
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,831
A church full of believers...
singing!

692
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:56,079
Your church is in the perfect 
order, I believe.

693
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,153
And so many generations.

694
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,957
I beg your pardon? 
I don't understand.

695
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,751
Well, Excellency, my Latin 
is pretty poor.

696
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:18,549
But you aren't so old yet.

697
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,390
Help yourself, help yourself.

698
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,075
You aren't so old, please, 
the consecration.

699
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:31,239
<i>Anno milesimo..one </i>

700
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,592
It is a long time ago.

701
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,395
You can go home now, John.

702
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,351
What does he say?

703
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,900
You look familiar...

704
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,917
Help yourself.

705
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:54,399
You look familiar...That's it! 
At St. Roche's!

706
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,830
Well, I...

707
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,951
Excellency...

708
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,195
I'm not a priest.

709
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,431
What are you, then?

710
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:08,999
A sexton.

711
01:19:09,075 --> 01:19:10,793
What does he say?

712
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,389
I am at a loss of words.

713
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,797
Try a dictionary, then.

714
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,593
You have no servants?

715
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,916
Not even a maid?

716
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,075
Don't forget to pack your bags.

717
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,398
You're going to the police 
station with us.

718
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,959
Take off that robe.

719
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,752
Just one thing.

720
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,238
May I assist you at mass tomorrow?

721
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,710
You're out of your mind.

722
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:32,117
A hundred years' worth of sacrilege
and he has the audacity...

723
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,358
I know, I wanted to make up for it.

724
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,075
The authorities will see to you,

725
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,229
But God will be the one.

726
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,676
Perhaps God will be merciful.

727
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,111
Hope and pray.

728
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:52,590
Excellency, I don't know if I dare...

729
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,432
Something else?

730
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,751
Could I apply to attend seminary?

731
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,789
The sinful pride of it!

732
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:08,270
I mean, after I am punished. I've 
been considering it for a long time.

733
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:12,756
I wasn't much of a believer, 

734
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,952
but I've come to see how 
much we all need

735
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,431
faith and consolation.

736
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,798
Dear Son, God closes the door 
to no one.

737
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:33,475
I can only say, go and pray.

738
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:49,555
Father, please, my sister is dying.

739
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,600
The Last Sacrament, Father, please!

740
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,992
I'd like to, but...

741
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,515
I'll go myself.

742
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:03,719
Oh Father, she'll be pleased. 
She's unconscious.

743
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,200
Extreme unction?

744
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,116
Yes, I'll go myself.

745
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,437
And you stay here and pray for 
your sinful soul.

746
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,798
Open up!

747
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,917
Gentlemen, we'll have to stay here. 

748
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,111
There's not enough room in 
my house.

749
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:09,270
Of course, I don't know why.

750
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:13,155
You gave us the first tip.

751
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,876
What's this? Clean it!

752
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,900
No, I only reported that 
the priest

753
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:25,915
drives when he's been drinking.

754
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:29,795
I didn't know you'd...
- It's a good thing.

755
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:33,631
If you'd known something and 
not reported it...

756
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,639
Yes, of course. 
But I'm against all of this.

757
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:40,037
I only wanted to scare him, 
but not to ruin him.

758
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:43,158
So you're on his side?

759
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,954
Oh no, not that!

760
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,913
Then watch your step or we'll
come and pick you up too.

761
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:52,498
Me? What for? Why?

762
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,999
We'll find something on you, 
don't worry.

763
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,038
On anybody, in fact!

764
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,873
How terrible!

765
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,075
Do you know what you've done?

766
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:12,397
Christenings...well, no child 
died, that can be fixed.

767
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,990
But Last Sacraments, 
weddings...

768
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,589
You've made Sodom and Gomorrah 
of this village.

769
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,751
No, not Sodom. Not me!

770
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,953
Well, at least your 
conscience is clean.

771
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,349
Father...Father.

772
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,557
Reverend Father...

773
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:06,396
Father, I didn't send Jude, 
really I didn't, honest Father.

774
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:10,599
Honest, Father. I, didn't send 
him, ever.

775
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:16,238
I like you, Father, lots.

776
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,758
I love you so much!

777
01:26:42,075 --> 01:26:43,240
All right, Majka, but now -

778
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:46,750
I know you're a priest.

779
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:49,796
I don't want anything, just so 
you're not mad.

780
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:23,148
Father, I know you're a priest, I
mustn't think of you that way...

781
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,759
Is anyone there?

782
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,800
Father, who is that in your bed?

783
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,800
A bishop.

784
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:38,693
God, and who's he?

785
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,851
Another bishop.

786
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:44,148
They even brought a sexton along?

787
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,039
Shh! No.

788
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:50,150
Why are they looking for him?
There isn't any sexton here.

789
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,679
Yes there is.

790
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,198
Where?

791
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:56,075
Here.

792
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,319
Where, here?

793
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:05,514
Shh! It's me. I'm no priest, 
I'm a sexton.

794
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,309
Jesus, you aren't a priest?

795
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,670
What's you name?

796
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:10,670
Albert.

797
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,234
Albert...

798
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:27,500
My God! 
Get thee behind me, Satan!

799
01:28:28,775 --> 01:28:31,118
Retreat, evil apparitions!

800
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,076
Scandalous!

801
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,749
Where am I? In a den of sinners?

802
01:28:38,075 --> 01:28:40,151
Or the home of a clergyman?

803
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,471
Haven't you seen the Reverend 
Father?

804
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,992
We'll expose him before the public.

805
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,191
Hadn't we better wait?

806
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,832
Until after mass?

807
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:09,356
No, we'll strike now. It's 
a matter of strategy.

808
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:44,595
Our Father is in well with 
the church -

809
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,155
Two bishops at the patron 
saint's day mass.

810
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,118
Two of them!

811
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,752
Beloved in Christ.

812
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:19,436
You have gathered to celebrate 
the day

813
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,555
of the sanctification of your 
church,

814
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:25,957
the day of your village's 
patron saint.

815
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,836
In the name of the law, I 
arrest you.

816
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,900
Do you know who I am? I am Joseph,
first bishop of the province!

817
01:30:36,075 --> 01:30:37,715
Come with us.

818
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,438
Oh, God be with us...

819
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,432
Revolution!

820
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:56,312
Wait! Stop! Turn him loose!

821
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,358
That's not him!

822
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,119
Over there!

823
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,076
Father, they're after you!

824
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,511
That isn't what I wanted to 
happen.

825
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,354
Wait, I'll give you a hand!

826
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,319
Stop!

827
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:41,153
My God, what have I forsaken 
thee?

828
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:03,389
What a horrible fall...
like a fallen angel.

829
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,435
May we ask God to forgive him?

830
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,671
I've forgiven him already.

831
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:23,396
He was a sinner, but there was a
longing in him.

832
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:28,229
Who knows how God will judge 
our deeds.

833
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:34,514
Can he be stricter than people?

834
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,836
This isn't what we wanted.

835
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:43,118
He was a good man. On the one 
hand we didn't agree with him, true,

836
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:46,437
but on the other hand people 
ought to love each other.

837
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:53,675
Let me voice our regret over 
this tragic, deadly, accident...

838
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,351
but I know better than all of 
you, that life goes on!

839
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:06,111
And we have brave deeds and 
a happy future ahead of us.

prison for their sins.</i>
