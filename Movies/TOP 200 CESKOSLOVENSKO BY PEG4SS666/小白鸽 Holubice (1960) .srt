00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,485
The White Dove

3
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,691
Open the cages!

4
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,125
Is that the lot? What?

5
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,968
Open the cages!

6
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,531
For God's sake, what's taking them?

7
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,961
Hurry! Hurry!

8
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,603
Hey!

9
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,488
You wanted to eat it, didn't you?

10
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,731
- You little good-for-nothing!
- This one's half dead.

11
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,247
There's nothing wrong with her.

12
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,761
Fly away, little one.

13
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:10,048
THAT MORNING CARRIER
PIGEONS FLEW FROM BELGIUM

14
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,007
THEY WERE ALSO EXPECTED

15
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,849
ON A SMALL ISLAND
IN THE BALTIC SEA

16
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,921
Hey! Call everyone,
the doves are here!

17
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,602
Where? Where are they?

18
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,127
What happened, my boy?

19
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,568
<i>Oh, you always
make a fuss, Ulli.</i>

20
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,803
Susanne! Susie!

21
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,123
Do you hear anything?
Can you see them?

22
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,925
You aren't even looking.

23
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,129
I don't have to look.
I know when my dove will be back.

24
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:49,482
- You're only thinking of yourself.
- No, I bet my dove will get here first.

25
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,210
I'm sure she will.

26
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,683
<i>- What's going on?
- He says his dove will be here first.</i>

27
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,366
You'll see. Just watch.

28
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,324
All we see is you shooting
your big mouth off.

29
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,971
You've made him mad.

30
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,002
They're coming, here they come!

31
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,803
Where, Susanne, where?

32
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,723
Seven...!

33
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,160
Look what I've got...

34
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,924
Where's my dove?

35
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,005
What you'd call an owl,
another might call a nightingale.

36
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,686
Mine is back,
my dove is back!

37
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,967
You scoundrels,
you've hidden my dove.

38
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,407
You lousy...

39
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:09,683
SUSANNE'S DOVE
WAS DRIVEN AWAY BY A STORM

40
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,606
AND GOT LOST

41
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,010
<i>Good evening.</i>

42
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,560
<i>I hope I'm not intruding.
I'd just like to ask you.</i>

43
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,406
<i>Do you have a balcony
facing the yard?</i>

44
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,731
<i>Yes, over here.
It's Michel's room.</i>

45
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,245
<i>But why...?</i>

46
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,891
<i>Could I speak
to your son for a minute?</i>

47
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,287
<i>Of course. I'll call him.</i>

48
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,125
Michal!
Come here, quickly!

49
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,162
Wait!

50
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,729
Do something!

51
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,521
Ulli!

52
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,927
Ulli!

53
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,970
Fetch Susanne!

54
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,010
Do I have to?
Right now?

55
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,651
Do what I told you!

56
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,288
Hurry up! Go home!

57
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,123
Are you going or aren't you?

58
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,845
And you leave Susanne alone, old man.

59
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,048
She doesn't do anything
at home any longer.

60
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,169
All she does is hang around
here on the beach.

61
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,722
Hasn't your dove
come back either?

62
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,963
That's none of your business.

63
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,928
Susanne, come quick.

64
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,931
Susanne, over there, on the beach.

65
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,487
0-3-303.

66
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,006
What shall we do?
Let's end her pains.

67
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,521
<i>Susanne!</i>

68
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:25,608
<i>Susanne!</i>

69
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,123
Don't worry about them, Susie,
they're only teasing you.

70
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,282
They're just like children.

71
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,729
Susanne...

72
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,763
Susanne, on the beach.
She's back.

73
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,087
There, on the beach chair!

74
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,128
This one is for you, Peter.
This one is for Paul.

75
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,567
And take this one to Michal.

76
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,202
- But he won't open the door.
- He will, run along.

77
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,402
<i>Misa!</i>

78
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,850
<i>Misa!</i>

79
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,685
<i>Misa!</i>

80
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,964
<i>Misa!</i>

81
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,967
Have you come to kill her?

82
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,808
She's dead, anyway.

83
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,931
Open the door, it's us.

84
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,765
We want to play with you, Misa!

85
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,727
Misa!

86
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,002
Misa!

87
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,203
Misa!

88
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,887
Misa! Misa!

89
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,840
He's scared! He's scared!

90
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,606
Come on, Frantisek.
Stand over here.

91
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,844
What's your name?

92
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,086
Michal!

93
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,527
Michal. Get up, Frantisek!

94
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,409
I don't want to.

95
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,281
Nurse, lift him up.

96
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,046
Stand straight, Frantisek!

97
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,888
Nurse, take my findings down.

98
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,681
Heart and lungs.
Skiascopy, no findings.

99
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,565
So you've decided
not to walk, Frank?

100
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,966
Don't you want to play outside,
in the sun?

101
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,328
Don't you want to play
with the other children?

102
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,687
I don't want to!

103
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,362
Martin!

104
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,161
Just a moment.
Are you looking for something?

105
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,971
- I'm looking for a dove.
- Yes? For a dove?

106
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,964
- But it must be a white one.
- A white one?

107
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:53,524
White ones are hard to find.
Wouldn't another colour do?

108
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,604
- I only want a white one.
- Wait, I have a fine grey one.

109
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:01,402
- Could I have a look at the pigeons?
- Of course, come with me.

110
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,845
What about this one?
Come here, little one. Don't be afraid.

111
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,688
Looking for stray pigeons:

112
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,330
England

113
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,970
Hungary

114
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,610
Germany

115
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,250
Belgium

116
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,890
Poland

117
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,445
0-3-303...

118
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,320
I'll work until I've paid for her.

119
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,889
No.

120
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,762
I can't let you have her.

121
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,481
Take her!

122
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,642
Martin!

123
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,488
Look!

124
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,043
<i>Satan, go away!</i>

125
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,969
Misa!

126
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,724
Come here!

127
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,409
She's still weak.
She couldn't fly far.

128
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,683
You should be glad.

129
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:31,481
Hello, boys!
Look what I've got.

130
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,011
- Does she fly?
- Of course!

131
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,287
Let her go, then.

132
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,962
Misa, what are you going to do
when she's well again?

133
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,242
She doesn't belong to you.

134
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,643
Lemonade!

135
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,168
Lemonade!

136
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,482
I've got something for you.

137
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,162
What do you think this means?

138
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,329
It's for Susanne.

139
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,365
Someone in Czechoslovakia
sent this to her.

140
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,850
Hey, wait a minute.
What's the hurry?

141
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,446
Where are you off to?

142
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,448
She'll come back.

143
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,323
Let her go, Misa!

144
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:07,644
<i>''Glow, glow, silver moon...</i>

145
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,726
<i>''I'm getting ready
for my honeymoon...</i>

146
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:25,408
<i>''Green suit, red boot...</i>

00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:58,329
