1
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,520
It was a world for itself, up here.

2
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,120
Last few cottages, last few people.

3
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,400
The cottage of Adama and his mother was the most last.

4
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,960
Adam's mother was the most last woman in the village.

5
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,440
Heel!

6
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,120
I don't want to buy it. I've got enough meat.

7
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,760
Take it to Buxa in Reznovice. Buxa might buy it.

8
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,920
Eighty.
I need one hundred.

9
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,160
One hundred? Do I steal? One hundred?

10
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,960
He doesn't have meat. He'll buy.

11
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,640
Ninety, it's a robbery.
Hundred.

12
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,200
Jesus, hundred?
Do you know how much it is?

13
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,640
One hundred for such poor cow?
Do you think I'm crazy?

14
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:39,320
Ninety five.
What a trading with you.

15
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,240
God is my witness,
what a fool I am. The biggest!

16
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,560
What have I done? What's wrong with you?
You know what.

17
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,400
I can't give you more medicine,
Adam. It's expensive.

18
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,080
I've given you 4x on credit
and it won't help to your mom.

19
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,640
Understand! I would bancrupt!
I've got enough of credits I'll never see.

20
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,240
I can't wait you'll pay me the morphium.

21
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,680
Give me a bigger.

22
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:56,080
Strange man. Who's his father?
Memory to her whoring. He's an ape.

23
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,960
Adam!

24
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,360
Where are you, Adam?

25
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,320
Adam!

26
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,640
Mom!

27
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,600
Mom!

28
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,200
Don't sleep, mom!

29
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,480
Wake up!

30
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,280
Why aren't you sleeping? Go to bed, Adam!

31
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,240
Drink!
You're a man, Adam, aren't you?

32
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,560
Adam!

33
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Adam!

34
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,000
Adam!

35
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,320
Adam!

36
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,120
Adam!

37
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,040
Adam! Come, return!

38
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,040
Stand! Come home!

39
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,080
Adam!

40
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,440
Adam! Adam dear!

41
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,800
Mom, wipe your mouth!

42
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,920
Brok, come home!

43
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,240
What a misery!

44
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,200
Damn the stuff.

45
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,520
Shit, how can I drive this?

46
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Don't stare and give the stick inside!

47
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,600
We need a fourth!

48
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,880
Not you! You wouldn't keep it.
I'll help you.

49
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
My condolence.

50
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,120
My condolence.

51
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,400
Don't be affraid, little one!

52
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,640
Tell me something!

53
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,880
Mom, what are you two talking about?
It wants us to let her go to its mom.

54
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,160
Shall we? Yes!

55
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,240
Mr. Adam.

56
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,840
Can you hear?

57
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,440
Mr. Adam, open!

58
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,840
I know you're at home, I saw you.

59
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:55,160
You're not lettin me stand here, are you?
I've come a long way.

60
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,040
I knew you won't let me here.
Get off, or...

61
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,360
What will you do here all alone?
Who will wash and boil for you?

62
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,040
Get off!
Dirt will eat you!

63
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,200
You'll eat bugs for dinner.
Go away!

64
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,040
Where you've been whoring until now,
you can whore even now.

65
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,600
What are you thinking about yourself?
That some high lady comes for you?

66
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,320
Look at yourself, how you looks.
Just like an orangutang.

67
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,800
I'm not that bad, mr. Adam.

68
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,280
If I were such bitch as you think,
I would go somewhere where is less work.

69
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:17,120
I can work!
You and work? You can do discgrace at most.

70
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,880
Why are you kicking in it, you jerk?
Kick in something yours.

71
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,840
If you've broken my pots, so...
Fuck off with your pots.

72
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,720
Adam deat, come here!

73
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,600
Doesn't it hurt?
No!

74
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,400
Doesn't it really hurt?
Not anymore.

75
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,760
Where have you been? Where have you hidden?

76
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,640
Can you hear me? Come out, you bitch.

77
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,400
I'm not asking for anything from you.

78
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,120
You can take your cakes away.

79
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:46,520
Let me be. Why are you beating me?
Who has asked you to come here?

80
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,000
Animal! Goon!

81
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,800
Whore!

82
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,760
And what about your mother? Was she saint?

83
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,320
Who was your father? Every night
slept with someone else.

84
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,440
And what you?

85
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,480
No! I don't want!

86
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,280
I haven't come because of it.

87
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,360
That's for me?

88
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,880
What are you doing?

89
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,120
No! Not that!

90
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,720
What do you want? The ring you've stolen from me.

91
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:52,840
What ring?
Go, we'll look around.

92
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,200
I haven't stolen anything.
I don't know anything about any ring.

93
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,680
It was mine anyway, you gave me it.

94
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,200
And where do you have it?
I threw it away.

95
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,520
You're nothing to do here.

96
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,280
Why don't you fire her?
Do you want to have a public shame?

97
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,320
Don't you have enough of a shame of your mom?

98
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:36,280
Get out!
No! They're waiting for it, so they can frame you.

99
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,760
Roza, come with us!
What will you eat here? Stones?

100
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,400
You're not gonna make it here until plums.
Bet on that.

101
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,000
I'll never return! Never!

102
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,280
I've catch a golden fish.
Look!

103
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,120
Do you have any wish? Tell me!

104
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,480
We have one, don't we?

105
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,960
Fishy fish, if you're going to fullfil our wish,
I'll let you go.

106
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,840
Our dad liked to stray.

107
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,040
And always when he returned,
he was felt like gin.

108
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,720
He was telling us fairy tales.

109
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,960
One day, two children wandered off seeking strawberries.

110
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,560
The sun set behind mountains and
suddenly lights over swamps began to dance...

111
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,880
...such blue lights.

112
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,520
The children were still too young a they
began to laugh at them.

113
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,360
The lights get angry and suddenly
big red flames arouse.

114
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,800
The children started to run and they arrive to eremite.

115
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,400
He hid them in his beard.

116
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:09,720
And told them: Children, make the lights
good with you, or they'll take you away.

117
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,480
Collect all the slivers from bread,
and pour them behind the doors.

118
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:25,000
Children did it,
lights eat up and disappeared.

119
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,120
He himself made it up?
He was still making up.

120
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,440
Before he died from drinking.

121
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,360
How many left?

122
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:33,680
You'll wait to see.
You have to stick with it a while.

123
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,960
I can't.

124
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:40,920
I've said I can't. Can you hear?

125
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,840
And can you drink beer with fire tender?

126
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,120
Come home Roza! Let her go and have some!

127
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,040
What did she have? I'll pay it.

128
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,720
You don't pay anything, I ordered it,
I pay it. No!

129
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:27,960
It's dark now, wipe the color
and come! What color?

130
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,280
The red on your mouth. Wipe it!
You don't like it?

131
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,880
Guys like it, don't they?
Yes! Sure!

132
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,440
Once more, inn-keeper!
Not anymore! Let me be!

133
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,880
What is he doing to her? Stop! Let me be!

134
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,440
Tell him to let me be. Help me someone!

135
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,880
Guys, do something,
he'll kill her.

136
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,080
He's an animal!
Let her go, Adam! Let her go!

137
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,960
Give it to him!
You bastard!

138
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,280
Stop, jerks! Are you out of your mind?

139
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,400
Come here to me!

140
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,320
Enough! Let him be! Can you listen?

141
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,320
Don't you see it?
They'll kill him. Enough!

142
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,160
Let it be, you'll kill him.
Do you want to end in jail?

143
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,520
Bastards, let it be.

144
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,000
Adam, what's with you? Can you hear?

145
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,560
Adam, can you hear?

146
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,440
You killed him!

147
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,480
See? There's nothing with him.

148
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:54,920
Adam, you can't carry it.
I can! Release!

149
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,240
Why are you blinking at me?

150
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:59,920
Count it! Why, I already did. Count it again!

151
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,400
Wait, come back!

152
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,200
Excellent!

153
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,880
It'll be nice milk cow.
We'll have much milk.

154
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:00,080
And I will be making butter.
And we'll have curd.

155
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,600
And cheese.

156
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:15,640
Beautiful shepperdess fed cows,
in a green wood under a maple...

157
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,160
Isn't it too tight?

158
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:46,960
She is great and strong!
She is strong and big.

159
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,000
And beautiful!

160
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,080
Why are you shaking? You're not going to him.

161
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,320
I hope he won't kill her.
Nobody died because of it.

162
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,360
You should have known.
Or you have forgoten?

163
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,720
Even the smallest can carry the biggest.

164
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,720
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
I'll kill you! Stop it, damn!

165
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,120
Adam!

166
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,560
I'll hand you over to policemen.
I'll come to kill you!

167
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,680
Remember!
I'll burn your house!

168
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,200
They can even hang me, I don't care. Release him!

169
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,440
Don't show yourself here!
Move on with cow to Rapotice.

170
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,480
In order to be all right,
in order to have calves...

171
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,720
...and to bring it to the world. Amen!

172
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,240
Look! See?
It's the eremite.

173
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,560
From the the fairy tale I told you.

174
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:14,160
He assigned me? He got what he deserved.
He did nothing to him.

175
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,320
I'm here because of her!

176
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,760
And because of the stolen ring.
I threw it away.

177
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:26,960
And he gave me it! So let me be!

178
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,240
Who sell it to the watchmaker in the town?

179
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,400
You'll pay or you'll be arrested.
Neither this nor that.

180
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:41,040
We'll talk at the station.
Sign this.

181
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:47,200
If you're not coming, we'll send you an escort.

182
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,400
Wasn't I right, when I told you to fire her?

183
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:58,920
You weren't listening, and now you'll in it too.

184
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,520
You're sitting here like stone,
and you say nothing.

185
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,600
You think I'm a thief?

186
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:29,240
We don't have money to pay.
I'll serve my sentence.

187
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,240
Adam!

188
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,520
Hold!

189
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:42,000
Don't, Adam!
Hold still, little one! She'll stay here.

190
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,240
Don't be affraid! I won't give you.

191
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,440
Roza, be reasonable. Do you want to be arrested?

192
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,920
Do you want to viewed as dirty sheep?

193
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,600
Let them to.

194
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,440
What is this about? You're seeing everything according to testimony.

195
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,920
But down there it's not like that.

196
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,800
Is it her fault?
Look at her!

197
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:14,120
Look at her eyes!
Sell it who knows where.

198
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:18,000
Just now, when she'll have the calf.
How could you?

199
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:23,960
Come, little one! We're going home! Come!

200
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:30,840
Be with her at home and I'll come down.
We'll see then.

201
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:35,240
What did you miss, Roza?
Tell me!

202
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:44,080
I would really give you the ring.
I bought it for you.

203
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:49,400
Why didn't you do that?
Roza, come back!

204
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:55,920
I will settle it down with policemen
and you'll have verything here.

205
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,000
And I'll be a girl for all again.

206
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:04,520
No! Believe me!
After you have left I realized...

207
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,200
How many did you pay for it?
35.

208
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,800
He gave me only 30,
thief!

209
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,480
I'll give you the money, but you have to wait.

210
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:26,920
Ludva, what the thieving whore is
doing here? Tell her to get out!

211
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,640
And comes no more, bitch.

212
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:36,160
Where are you son?
Will you wait? Yes.

213
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:59,320
Butcher promised, he'll wait.
We can service the debt.

214
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:06,280
What did he want in exchange?
He wanted me to return.

215
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,920
But he failed as you can see.

216
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,920
In order to forgive him all his sins.
He's got more!

217
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,840
We sell the calf and
we'll give it all at once.

218
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:29,680
We'll never sell this girl.
She belongs to family as you and me.

219
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:50,960
That's nothing, Adam! I'll have a child!

220
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,680
No?
We'll have children!

221
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:30,960
It is necessary to bless your tie
in a church, so the child will be healthy.

222
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:39,480
It has to raise in a proper family.
Do you understand? Yes, tell him.

223
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:44,440
Adam, disgrace of peopel is terrible.
You knew it yourself.

224
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:50,680
Remember, it would afflict even the child.
It depends on Roza, what she says.

225
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:56,320
We can discuss the term now.

226
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:03,800
Isn't it late, father?
There's never late.

227
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,760
Join your hands.

228
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,240
What does God join, human don't unjoin.

229
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:28,720
I join you in a marriage, in the name of
the Father and Son and Holy Ghost. Amen!

230
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,200
Eremite!

231
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,800
Adam, it's here!

232
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:34,320
Take yourself and run to the keeper-house.

233
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,120
Get to the cot and stay with it.

234
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:46,040
Heat the stove, I'll carry wood.

235
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,400
He's healthy, congratulations.

236
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:50,520
Thanks, young mrs., good luck!
We also thanks.

237
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,440
For his good health!

238
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,880
Have you heard? He said me young mrs.

239
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,320
Roza!

240
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,360
Hold!

241
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,400
Adam!

242
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,920
You've got Adam!

243
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,400
Very health boy, Adam!

244
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,280
But let mother better be careful!
She's very weakened.

245
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,360
Come!

246
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,440
Here little!

247
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,400
Roza!

248
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:10,560
Why are you here? I told you I'll
take care, since you're sick.

249
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:16,800
Wait! Did you pour them? Whom?
The lights.

250
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,640
I've seen them dance on the stove.

251
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:25,360
We have to give them something.
I'll do it, dont be affraid.

252
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,720
She'll make it, but it won't be in a moment.

253
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:01,120
She has weak lungs, it needs time and patience.

254
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,320
A lot of patience.

255
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:12,760
I've heard, you need someone
who can take care about child.

256
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,800
My name is Anezka.

257
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:20,040
Bitch!

258
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,000
I'll kill you.

259
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,960
I'll kill you whore!
I'll kill even the child!

260
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:33,320
I'll kill myself!

261
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,520
Can you hear? He's probably hungry.

262
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:17,560
I'll build the wall here and
carry the loam from downstairs.

263
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,080
It'll be a good piece of field.

264
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:35,240
As every day, as always,
as the whole life.
