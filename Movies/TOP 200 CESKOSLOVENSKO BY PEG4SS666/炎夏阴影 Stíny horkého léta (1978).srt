1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Shadows of a hot summer

2
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,000
It happened by the end of the summer 1947

3
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,999
Rikina!

4
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,872
Come on.

5
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,951
-You'll be better off here.
-Was it you, Mr.Baran?

6
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,480
-The doctor is not here.
-This is from Terezka.

7
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,600
Everyone brings cheese or eggs,

8
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,480
But we hardly get to see any
money from you people.

9
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,109
Hold on.
Cheese and cheese, all the time.

10
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,833
Once again, his horse is here.

11
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,198
Thank you.

12
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,189
-And in autumn...
-You'll bring us wool. I know.

13
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,597
Why do you leave your horse stinking
in front of my shop?

14
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,111
I brought some sheep cheese.

15
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,918
No smoking in my shop.

16
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,158
Eleven kilograms?

17
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,478
Eleven and a half.

18
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,038
Right, twelve.

19
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,872
-It's kinda smelly.
-I'll sell it elsewhere, then.

20
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,552
Wait, I'll buy it.

21
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,549
One kilogram of salt, two kilograms
of sugar, two packets of tobacco,

22
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,239
candy for the kids,

23
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,632
You are thirsty, eh?

24
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,158
So am I.

25
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,153
Boy, boy, you're living a good life.

26
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,277
Meat is scarce. And selling venison
meat earns a lot, right?

27
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,792
-Or did you shoot a boar?
-I hunted one down.

28
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,312
-You could do it yourself, in this heat.
-Stop joking, Beran.

29
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,160
-You know there are charges against you.
-Are there? Anonymous? -Do you think so?

30
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,436
I wonder why you keep tolerating
his partisan ways.

31
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,272
Two years after the end of the war.

32
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,115
So you have charges but no witnesses.

33
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,474
Otherwise you'd have me jailed by
now, the kind of people you are.

34
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,839
Do we know each other
so little, Ondrej?

35
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,955
Why do you tell me this, Mr.Grygar?

36
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,188
You act like you've never shot
at anything in your life.

37
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,838
Good morning.

38
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,879
Dad, could we give Lucy a ride?

39
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,396
-Ok.
-Come on.

40
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,712
Good morning.

41
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,559
Get down, kids.

42
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,000
Just a minute and
we'll go on home.

43
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,991
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

44
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,752
Welcome, Ondrej.

45
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,391
Wine, cold water
and juice for the kids.

46
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,076
Can you see him, the sheepman?

47
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,358
He smells of cheese,

48
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,189
but he drinks his wine with water.

49
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,115
One shot of brandy
would kill him.

50
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,150
-Anyone know him?
-Some Beran from Bukovy Hill.

51
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,515
Do you remember Tereza Jezova?

52
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,672
-From Podtate?
-Right.

53
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,870
He married her.
It was before the war.

54
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,149
-I'll switch it off.
-She wasn't bad.

55
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,517
Poor thing, she'd deserve
a better man,

56
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,720
than this smelly sheepman.

57
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,236
I believe he sleeps with
his sheep in the muck.

58
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,918
Haven't you heard them?

59
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,312
Wait outside.

60
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,671
Don't tell them to go away.

61
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,350
Better crawl in a pile
of dung yourself.

62
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,480
Moooo! Sheepman.

63
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,315
Ondrej, do you still have
any plum brandy left?

64
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,120
Why?

65
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,112
I haven't made enough in winter.
My stock is getting thin.

66
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,440
Hurry up! Soon it'll get dark
and a wolf will come

67
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,200
-and eat your little sheep.
-You could make some profit.

68
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,158
There'll be a new plum brandy
in six months time,

69
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,592
There will be enough of it
and the prices will be low.

70
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,437
-your little Tereza Jezova
-Leave him alone, Josef.

71
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,036
-How many plums do you have?
-It's poor.

72
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,440
-Sixty trees.
-Yeah, you and your type

73
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,160
lounging with a woman
while there was a war.

74
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,754
-Leave him.
-Let go!

75
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,880
Tell you what. If, in this drought,

76
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,680
you yield more than 6 litres
of plum brandy

77
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,036
I'll give you for each extra litre
two litres of my own.

78
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,758
So you won't sell?

79
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,476
-You're not afraid to leave her
alone, Beran? -I'll sell in winter.

80
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,748
It will be as expensive as
a cognac in winter.

81
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,880
But you're afraid of this.
Aren't you?

82
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,950
Stop making mess here!

83
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,432
Look,

84
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,395
this hand has killed so many Germans.

85
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,878
-Wimp.
-Hm.

86
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,789
You'd let me shit on your head,
wouldn't you.

87
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,560
I'll gladly meet you when
you're sober.

88
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,880
Lukas said he'd walk.

89
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,592
He was crying.

90
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,392
Really.

91
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,272
Stop it, Rikina.

92
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,473
He kept on calling Rikina
to go with him.

93
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,119
But she ignored him. She only
obeys you, doesn't she?

94
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,078
Thank you, Mr.Beran.

95
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,795
Don't be angry with Lukas.

96
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,633
He thinks you should have beaten
up that fella.

97
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,038
Wait till we're home, son.

98
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,032
The water's too cold for you.

99
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,520
Now, now, don't act like
you're a hero.

100
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,391
Come on.

101
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,998
Quiet, Rikina.

102
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,918
Stay here.

103
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,598
Tereza?

104
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,150
There's nothing we can do, son,

105
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,915
we gotta ride down again.

106
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,519
We had some vermin here, Rikina.

107
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,632
You go home.

108
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,678
Rikina.

109
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,992
Come on.

110
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,279
Take your time.

111
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,839
We've got enough time.

112
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,317
I'll be back soon.

113
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,957
Who is it?

114
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,514
-Who's there?
-Rafaj was stabbed. In the pub.

115
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,632
-Which Rafaj?
-Pavel Rafaj. Stabbed with a knife.

116
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,317
-Like animals.
-We need a doctor, quick.

117
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,320
-Here.
-Go to bed.

118
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,436
And you don't stay in the pub.

119
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,195
-Good evening, doctor.
-Where have you been, Pavlina?

120
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,558
-Just ... to see a friend.
-A friend, right?

121
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,432
Good night.

122
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,718
How many of them are there?

123
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,196
About five, I guess.

124
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,156
Including this Holy Willie.

125
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,392
The Bandera guerillas, right?

126
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,708
Why didn't you tell
the police?

127
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,874
If they let you go to town.

128
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,397
Right.

129
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,752
I could have run away.

130
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,472
But why? They have my Tereza
and my kids.

131
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,548
The captain would know how to
handle this.

132
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,080
-This situation.
-Captain Grygar?

133
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,077
Lucky I didn't tell him.

134
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,148
These people are no bunch of
poachers, doctor.

135
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,431
Come here, I have something
to heal your face.

136
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,312
Remember our place, how it
looks like.

137
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,314
The house is in the middle
of a grazing,

138
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,397
You can see everything from there.

139
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,152
There's no way you can
come there unobserved.

140
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,918
And no way to run away.

141
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,034
-Here, taste this.
-It's not about running away.

142
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,679
The wounded one is probably
some high ranking officer.

143
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,349
He said that if he sees a
suspicious move

144
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,431
They'll bake the kids in the oven.

145
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,158
A man like this. Shit.

146
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,597
And you're supposed to heal him.

147
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,353
Eh...

148
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,230
-What is this?
-My patent.

149
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,232
Juniper, rowanberry, wild plums.

150
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,078
Got a cigarette?

151
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,758
Ask him.

152
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,991
He took my rolling papers too.

153
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,996
I think you should have told
the police.

154
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,758
They'd send the army and that
would do it.

155
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,119
Noone wants to end up
on the gallows.

156
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,391
They don't care about anything. Either
they shoot their way through, or they die.

157
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,958
They don't care.

158
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,868
I need a lot of boiling water.

159
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,036
I'll have to open the wound.

160
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,069
But I have no anesthetics.

161
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,317
Do you understand me?

162
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,438
Two men should hold you.
At least.

163
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,468
Tereza, pass me that little
dark bottle.

164
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,112
Don't smoke here.

165
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,599
I'm telling you not
to smoke here!

166
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,880
-Come on!

167
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,317
-Mom, little Petra has wet herself.
-Change her diaper, Lukas, please.

168
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,596
What's the doctor doing here?

169
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,079
-He's looking after the sick man.
-A guerilla?

170
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,630
-Where's daddy?
-He's sleeping.

171
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,718
Sleeping?

172
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,597
He was awake the whole night.
He's tired, Lukas.

173
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,032
Will he get better?

174
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,672
Yeah.

175
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,796
Leave him be, Tereza.

176
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,552
There's enough of them
to look after him.

177
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,477
It's not so bad.

178
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,836
But it will take a week before
he can walk again.

179
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,272
A week?

180
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,392
Maybe more.

181
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,038
Sieben Tagen.

182
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,239
Tereza, where can I lie
down for a while?

183
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,359
Go upstairs, to the room
where Ondrej sleeps.

184
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,518
I've got to get some sleep.

185
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,072
What did they want?

186
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,238
First they wanted you.

187
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,712
-Me?  -Yesterday, when they brought
the wounded one.

188
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,511
Now they want more.

189
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,150
Civilian clothes, food, money.

190
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,999
And a map.

191
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,960
Said it's up to me to get all
this in a week's time.

192
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,960
-Then they'll be gone.

193
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,757
Yeah, gone. I'd like to see that.

194
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,269
The wounded one, my friend,
will be here for a week at least.

195
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,800
In case he was not infected
during the operation.

196
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,916
Which is likely.

197
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,677
If he's lucky,

198
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,400
it will take a few extra
days for him to,

199
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,470
start walking again.

200
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,920
They brought him in, they can carry
him away, too.

201
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,718
Yeah, they can. You go and tell them.

202
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,597
I'll have to sell my plum brandy
to get all that they want.

203
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,960
Ondrej, did you consider what
would happen

204
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,838
if someone came to see you ?

205
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,912
Noone ever comes to see us.

206
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,871
Maybe in Easter.

207
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,237
But it can happen.

208
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,352
Only if they came looking for you.

209
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,952
For me?

210
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,115
If they come looking for me,

211
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,034
it will take some time. And they
won't search for me here.

212
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,512
To feed them and you for such
a long time ...

213
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,312
I'll have to kill a sheep.

214
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,669
I'm afraid a week is too much.

215
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,400
What if the guy gets alright,

216
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,515
and they'll really leave?

217
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,236
Will they leave us alone?

218
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,680
What do you think, doctor?

219
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,912
Say it again?

220
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,119
Nothing.

221
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,118
Mooo!

222
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,678
Lukas?

223
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,638
Come here!

224
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,318
Come on!

225
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,515
It's time you learn
how to scythe.

226
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,318
You've seen enough of me to
know how it's done.

227
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,473
Keep the bottom on the ground
and turn around.

228
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,278
You'll be good in it.

229
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,272
Try again.

230
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,072
Why don't you tell them
to leave?

231
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,835
You keep them here and
serve them.

232
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,235
Even though they killed Rikina?

233
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,078
Because you're scared!

234
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,231
I know you are!

235
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,400
Yesterday in the pub you
were scared too!

236
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,990
You let them do what they want!

237
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,877
And you, you heal them!

238
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,996
Want a cigarette?

239
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,110
I've bummed one from Terezka.

240
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,792
Here.

241
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,920
Don't be angry with the boy.

242
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,120
He's a good son.

243
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,638
Lukas?

244
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,040
Come, eat something.

245
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:16,110
-...and he ran and hide.
-Grodski!

246
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,158
Did you want anything?

247
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,431
Lukas!

248
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,758
Stop yelling.

249
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,229
-Doctor...
-What is it?

250
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,112
Go and stay with Tereza,
she's alone in there.

251
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,160
I'll be back soon!

252
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,391
You can't do that, Lukas.

253
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,991
We can't call anyone here.

254
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,358
Lukas,

255
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,719
what you said to your father
is too complicated.

256
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,753
Sometimes even the strongest man
can't do anything.

257
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,592
There are five of them.

258
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,038
They have guns.

259
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,880
-nothing can stop them.
-One of them is sick.

260
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,269
That's still four.

261
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,474
You all just serve them.

262
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,550
There's nothing we can do
about it, son.

263
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,316
We just have to live
through this.

264
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,114
I wouldn't let them.

265
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,954
At least, I'd run away.

266
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,912
I wouldn't do anything for them.

267
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,872
But what about your mom?

268
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,318
And what about little Petra?

269
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,192
You're doing us wrong.

270
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,957
And you're hurting your dad.

271
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,112
How much have you got?

272
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,832
Twenty five litres.

273
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,118
You'll sell it all?

274
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,310
One litre more or one litre less...

275
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,592
Wild plum brandy?

276
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,279
Hm...

277
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,831
Fertig.

278
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,192
Pour some hot water
on my hands.

279
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,470
Where do I get the money now?

280
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,197
Come on.

281
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,756
It's better than if they
got drunk.

282
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,631
We've made a little
disinfection here.

283
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,997
I like the sun but this is
too much.

284
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,398
Lukas!

285
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,912
Come here.

286
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,078
Why?

287
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,232
Just come.

288
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,431
You'll learn how to milk.

289
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,674
-You...

290
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,996
I'd like to see you in my place.

291
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,754
Hit it with a stick. On its head.

292
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:25,440
You don't hit animals. You've
said that yourself.

293
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,000
-It depends which animal.
-No animal.

294
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,470
Never hit a dog. Especially not
with your hand.

295
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,308
A dog which is afraid of his master's
hand is good for nothing.

296
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,509
It's an insult for him. It's
an insult for a horse too.

297
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,589
Crack the whip in the air
or just hit it really light.

298
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,676
Otherwise it won't obey you.

299
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,990
But you have no choice with the ram.
It can only understand a stick.

300
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,871
-It's you or the ram.
-Do I have to hit it in the head?

301
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,716
Other places will hurt it.

302
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,272
Come.

303
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,312
You'll learn it.

304
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,956
But don't pull so hard.

305
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,074
Poor sheep.

306
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,592
Ondrej?

307
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,398
Wait.

308
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,520
Ondrej!

309
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,909
If any of you touches Tereza
again, I'll kill you.

310
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,958
You can shoot us if you want to.

311
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,318
-We need to bring the feed in.
-Hm.

312
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,035
What do you want to do, Ondrej?

313
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,872
What do you mean?

314
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,232
Look!

315
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,757
Just like your old man.

316
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,355
-I know you well...
-We have to wait till he gets better.

317
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,078
Ondrej.

318
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,395
I'll get everything they want.

319
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,390
and in a couple of days,
we'll be fine again.

320
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,718
Where do you get the
money for that?

321
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,832
Good morning.

322
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,320
-Have you gone crazy?
-How much do you pay?

323
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:09,480
What a damage. Coulnd't you
wait one more month?

324
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,950
How much do you think I'll pay
for this slink?

325
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,551
-Good enough for stuffing, that's all.
-It's up to me, when I shear my sheep.

326
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,594
And you pay me as much as
you want.

327
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,832
But hurry.

328
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:27,956
Give me twenty more packets
of tobacco ...

329
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,751
And two hundred ...

330
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,353
cigarettes.

331
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,357
Beer for you, Mr. Grygar?

332
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,792
Yes.

333
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:46,511
What, are you opening a
tobacconists' up there?

334
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,832
Or a clothes shop?

335
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,231
Maybe, since you've sheared
your sheep so early

336
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,597
you should buy more from
the jew?

337
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,155
You gotta dress them sheep,
now that they're naked.

338
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,636
You sniff like a dog.

339
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,233
Why don't you try to find
the doctor instead?

340
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,797
Tereza,

341
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,876
would you have any...

342
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:25,111
You'd better go upstairs.
I'll bring it for you.

343
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,119
Doctor, what is Ondrej
going to do?

344
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,832
I don't know.

345
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,992
You don't know him so well.

346
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,314
I don't believe he'll leave
it like that.

347
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,556
He'll think of something.

348
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:09,595
But there is now way he can
fight them, is there ?

349
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,116
I'm afraid there isn't.

350
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:19,469
He's not afraid of anything.
He's crazy enough.

351
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,031
A mountainman. Stubborn
like a ram.

352
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,109
Yeah, like a ram.

353
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:32,831
It's not that there are
four or five of them.

354
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,988
It's that these people are trained
to kill. Understand, Tereza?

355
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,873
They are capable of doing things
Ondrej has never heard of.

356
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,797
You tell him that.

357
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:47,079
It wouldn't help. As if you
didn't know.

358
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,109
You know what is worst?

359
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,355
That they don't care about
anything anymore.

360
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,798
They've lost everything,

361
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,718
and I don't think they have
anything ahead of them.

362
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,388
Poor men.

363
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:15,112
-I am so sorry for them too.
-Hm?

364
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,236
Tereza, Tereza.

365
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,512
What are you doing here?

366
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,272
-Is it your forest?
-No.

367
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,477
There are others who'll
take care of you.

368
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:27,076
I'll just answer that pub
talk of yours.

369
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,678
Hey, hey...

370
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,915
We know very well who was a partisan.
And we know who wasn't.

371
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:37,158
-So you better try it elsewhere.
-Mind your own business.

372
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,557
I'll just hit you.

373
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,632
Ondrej,

374
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,398
I can't do it anymore.

375
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,952
I am so scared.

376
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,790
Everything will be fine again.

377
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,916
What will happen when they leave?

378
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,792
What do you mean?

379
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,514
We will have peace, like
we used to have.

380
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,073
So why did the officer
say that?

381
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,718
Say what?

382
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,116
That you must understand,

383
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,354
That you'd do the same if
you were him.

384
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,388
God knows what you've heard.

385
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,911
I can hardly understand what
they're saying.

386
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,555
I understood very well.

387
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:21,280
He acted straight because
he has a bad conscience.

388
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,750
He apologized in advance for
what will happen.

389
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:28,356
No. He apologized for
being here.

390
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:39,872
Why didn't we move to the village,
to old Kristek's house.

391
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:46,156
Why didn't you listen to me.
This would never have happened.

392
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,310
Did we have any bad times here?

393
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:59,116
Mr. teacher has sent me to find
out what's up with Lukas.

394
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:02,670
He is sick. Come and see him.

395
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,515
I fell off a ladder.

396
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,872
-Did you bleed?
-Me?

397
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,398
His nose was bleeding.

398
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,033
But only a little.

399
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,237
Yeah, my nose.

400
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,951
Francek Skypala brought an adder
to school yesterday.

401
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,118
-So stinky. And he threw it on me.
-Was it alive?   -Yeah.

402
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,792
I'll beat him up.

403
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,198
Alright.

404
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,791
I have to go.

405
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,912
When are you coming back?

406
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:42,752
-The holidays will start soon.
-He will stay in bed for a few days.

407
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,358
He'll be back after sunday.

408
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,838
-Goodbye then.
-Give my greetings to Lojzik.

409
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,837
Now...

410
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:18,710
Do you have to mend the roof now?

411
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,552
Why not?

412
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,432
You said the drought will last
untill winter.

413
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,118
There's enough time for that.

414
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,799
Call Lukas.

415
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,160
-What for?
-He'll join me,

416
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:58,153
-so he can see how it's done.
-Why do you keep teaching him these things?

417
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:02,275
-He'll fall down.
-Why should he?

418
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,592
Call him.

419
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,036
You won't give him a break,
will you?.

420
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,310
First, it's scything, then
milking, shearing ...

421
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,113
-He's still a child.
-A child?

422
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:26,120
Soon he'll be a man. And he
will be the farmer.

423
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,388
You gotta give them that. They
are disciplined.

424
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,954
I guess it's in their blood
after all those years.

425
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,030
I gave them everything.

426
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,273
But the officer insists
on a map.

427
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:11,273
A detailed one, so that they can
find their way to the south.

428
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,958
South?

429
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,033
They're trying to get
to Austria.

430
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,515
And then further, maybe.

431
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,116
I have some maps.

432
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,719
At home.

433
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,389
I know I can't go there myself,
but I can give you my keys.

434
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,757
But what about Anezka?

435
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:40,030
You must go early. She's at the
service at half past four.

436
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,192
She's not home by then.

437
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,039
Alright.

438
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,917
Ondrej!

439
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,877
Ondrej Beran, wait a while.

440
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,720
Where is Rikina? I brought
her something.

441
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,960
It's a little stinky, but the
dogs like it that way.

442
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:23,760
-Good morning. Anything else?
-Why so early? -I'm in a hurry.

443
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,433
-Go!
-Can you give me a ride?

444
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:31,235
-How is it going up in the hills? Peaceful?
-Too peaceful.

445
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:37,080
There is a report of Bandera guerillas
operating in the region.

446
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:41,560
I thought the Slovak army has caught
them. They said that in the papers.

447
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:44,711
Really? Since when do you
people read papers?

448
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:49,760
I know that a guerilla has made
their way all the way here.

449
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,469
At Becva, they killed a hunter
and his whole family.

450
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,840
Only his wife survived. They
shot her in the shoulder.

451
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,877
They thought she was dead,
so they let her be.

452
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,511
I would have known about it if they were
here. I know about everything around.

453
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,393
I believe that.
And that's why I need you.

454
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,160
I got an order to search
the area.

455
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:17,596
I've got enough men, but noone knows
the hills like you do

456
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:22,199
-What about the partisan fella?
-Yeah, that one. For sure.

457
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,039
I need you, Ondrej.

458
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,232
I have to cut down the beeches.

459
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,152
So?

460
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,432
When do you plan to do it?

461
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,792
Alright, great.

462
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:42,029
We'll be there tomorrow.
Seven in the morning.

463
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,951
Tomorrow.

464
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,231
Lukas will sleep upstairs.

465
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,911
With me and the doctor.

466
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,469
-Why?
-To keep you from your silly ideas.

467
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,552
I don't want to.

468
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,074
You will sleep upstairs and
that's it!

469
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,312
Alright.

470
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,909
When you finish your meal, Lukas,
we'll take your bed upstairs.

471
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,836
Have some soup.

472
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,432
Lukas?

473
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:28,399
Here. What do you want to do
when they took your gun?

474
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:30,992
I'll think of something.

475
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,398
Quiet, let's not wake up
the doctor.

476
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,920
Mr.Hrabovsky from Vapenku has
a dog, a daughter of Rikina.

477
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:16,879
Tell him to give you a puppy.
Not a male. A female dog.

478
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,471
She will be like Rikina.

479
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,557
-But give her a different name.
-Why?

480
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,156
So that she doesn't end up
like Rikina.

481
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,552
It would be sad here,
without a dog.

482
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,998
One more thing I want to tell you,

483
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,951
stay here.

484
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,232
You were born here.

485
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,192
Just like me,

486
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,758
your grandfather
and his grandfather

487
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,396
Where would I go?

488
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,710
We're far away from people
but someone must live here, too.

489
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,720
Even here, someone must
work on the land.

490
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,597
Sleep now.

491
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:07,115
-Why did you tell me all that?
-Every thing has its time. Sleep now.

492
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,117
Good night, daddy.

493
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,120
Good night, son.

494
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,877
Nobody move!
Nobody move!

495
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:24,555
-Daddy!
-Wait. Ondrej!

496
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:25,999
Hide!

497
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:28,713
-There's one more.
-He's run away.

498
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:52,590
It's good now, Tereza.

499
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:23,798
Dad!

500
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,438
Dad!

501
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:30,435
-Ondrej...
-Wait, show me.

502
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,236
It's not serious.

503
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:39,516
-Tereza, don't pull.
-It hurst like hell.

504
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:44,593
-Lukas, bring me my suitcase.
-Hurry.

505
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,592
Hot water.

506
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,440
Daddy, watch out!

507
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:55,034
Ondrej Beran will farm no more.

508
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:59,358
Why didn't he tell me?

509
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:03,835
He couldn't have done
anything else.
