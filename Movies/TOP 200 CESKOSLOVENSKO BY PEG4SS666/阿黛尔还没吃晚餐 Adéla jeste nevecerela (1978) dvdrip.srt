00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,790
"Adela Has Not Had Dinner Yet"

3
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,490
Every Wednesday

4
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,580
Kuratko, Nick's helper,
delivering mail, noticing

5
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,770
the harvest of defeated evil,
thus commented to the point:

6
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,910
What a day again!

7
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,090
Clean it up, please!

8
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,450
Always the same.
When the chestnut is too hot for the police

9
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,900
the low ranks must handle it.
Skotenka, Skulteparik, Kamrik.

10
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,240
Who will be the lucky one?

11
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,930
Director of Police, Prague City.
Where is that?

12
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,360
In Vienna. So...?

13
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,100
Mysterious disappearance in an
important family

14
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,490
come immediately, will pay any price.

15
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,580
Interesting case!

16
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,420
We have not sorted out
the King's gang yet!

17
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,420
- Can you handle them alone?
- Sure, it's only one gang!

18
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,110
- Shall I pack your bags?
- Yes.

19
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,900
First some necessary information
about those Antipodeans.

20
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,230
Of course, I was right.

21
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:32,110
They use some kind of Slavic language. Well,
I'll have plenty of time to learn it aboard the ship.

22
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:39,140
- Interesting people!
- Will you use your usual perfect disguise there?

23
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,880
I will just melt into the crowd!

24
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,500
"Czech Quick and Easy"

25
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,460
Prague Terminal!

26
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:22,100
Beer! Beer! Drinking water!

27
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,490
Mr Carter! Welcome to Prague!
I'm the Director of Police, Knight Franz von Kaunitz.

28
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,400
...Hot dogs... hot dogs...
- Commissar Ledvina!

29
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,190
Josef Ledvina.

30
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:57,720
- I assume my arrival has been kept strictly secret.
- But of course!

31
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,210
The most famous
American detective's in Prague!...

32
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,000
Can't keep a secret here...

33
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,290
To your success, Mr Carter!

34
00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:00,630
- No denying it... Pilsen's the best!
- Pilsen?

35
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,070
Famous local beer.
The liquid bread of the Czech nation.

36
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,650
- That's some baggage!
- Please!

37
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,790
Present from my friend Edison!

38
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,280
- Why would you drag that with you?
- A modern detective must move with the times!

39
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,770
Technology is his friend!

40
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,760
A few drinks will achieve
the same result, too...

41
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:39,290
- To the point, gentlemen!
- Thank you!

42
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:54,160
- Mr Carter, this is an unusually mysterious case.
- That's the only type that interests me!

43
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:01,490
This happened in the bedroom of the wife of Duke Tuna.
She refuses any involvement of the police because of that.

44
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:07,930
This lady has therefore asked me
to engage you;

45
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,520
she is a great admirer of yours.

46
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,610
- She's sure you'll be able to explain the disappearance.
- Whose disappearance?

47
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:22,440
The lady will explain everything.
Here, a gesture of her gratitude...

48
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,380
A preliminary one...!

49
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,710
I work alone. However, I'm a stranger here and
cannot get by without some information.

50
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:43,200
Of course; that's why you'll have Commissar
Ledvina at your disposal.

51
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,290
A man Prague holds no secrets from!

52
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,820
- OK. Tomorrow.
- Investigation at the crime scene,

53
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,210
...this afternoon a sightseeing tour!
- Sure!

54
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,700
Let's go sightseeing, then!

55
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,220
Eureka! It's weeping!

56
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,390
- The plant is weeping!
- Congratulations, sir!

57
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,090
- Did he arrive?
- Yes, sir! He's staying at the Hotel Paris.

58
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:48,520
He has conferred with the Director of Police,
is sightseeing now and tomorrow will start investigating!

59
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,560
Good! If he wants to investigate,
he must open the jail of my Adela!

60
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,550
Of course, sir! By tomorrow night,
Adela will be back in your hands!

61
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,480
I didn't cut you off
a hangman's rope for nothing!

62
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:13,460
If only that American dick knew
he's paving the way for my revenge!

63
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,460
He's full of himself...
Can't handle us, though!

64
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,500
No way, sir!

65
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,540
Keep him in sight;
even a mosquito can sting!

66
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,430
My people aren't asleep, sir!

67
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,620
Very old castle.
From the Dark Middle Ages, surely.

68
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,160
Very dark!
That's why we put gas lights here!

69
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,500
- And the statues, are they hand-made?
- Of course, everything's hand-made here.

70
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,380
What wouldn't we do for the tourists!

71
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:04,350
All the talking's made me thirsty!
Have you drunk Pilsen before? No? Please!

72
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,300
So?

73
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:44,060
Another famous place; frequented by King Wenceslas.
But mainly they sell great sausages here.

74
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,050
And Pilsen?

75
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,570
Beautiful! One can just smell the history!

76
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,270
Yeah, it's just breathed out!

77
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,500
If you're interested in history,
this is a historical date.

78
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,990
Plekovsky was born...

79
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,440
Where is the stalk....

80
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,420
That terrible dream again...

81
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:02,300
You won't escape my revenge,
you old Satan!

82
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,500
5 o'clock; we're going home!

83
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,590
Thanks, Commissar!
Prague is a hard city to sightsee...

84
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:03,220
The old palaces,
the great cathedrals...

85
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,310
And we have not even visited
at the "Pinkas's"...

86
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:14,390
There's a bartender
there who just cuddles the beer!

87
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,970
- Every Wednesday.
- Let's go home...

88
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,280
The Lady's awaiting you.

89
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,760
Fit again...
Well, Commissar; pay me back.

90
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:20,800
- Hit me. Go on!
- As you wish!

91
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,470
- You don't box?
- No, we slap.

92
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,610
In this country,
I can't get by without you.

93
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,550
"You've won, Nick Carter!"
whispered the scoundrel.

94
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,740
"Say hello to the devil, Gardener"
said calmly the great detective.

95
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:56,470
Soon the criminal's face, contorted with hatred,
disappeared in the smelly swamp.

96
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:04,800
That was the end of the king of crime,
known in New York as The Gardener.

97
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,330
What a pity my dear Gert has not
lived to see the end of The Gardener!

98
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:18,520
My dear!
You talk about Gert as if he were dead!

99
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:24,110
Until that famous detective's had his last word,
you must keep hoping!

100
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,700
You are so kind...
have you forgiven Gert?

101
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,830
Sure. Such a little transgretion...
But I think Carter won't be around this morning.

102
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:41,870
- Why? - Apparently he got extremely tired
from all the sightseeing!

103
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,950
- Lady!
- Yes!

104
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,590
Oh, he's not tired!
Tell him to come in!

105
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,970
Excuse me, please;
I am supposed to be chairing a meeting

106
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,360
of a Committee for Protection
of Widows and Orphans!

107
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,400
He's so excentric!
Welcome, sir!

108
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:40,290
When dear Gert disappeared so mysteriously
behind those doors,

109
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:45,530
I put some radical measures in place,
so until your arrival

110
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,020
the crime scene was not disturbed.

111
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,900
- Praiseworthy foresight!
- I learned that from you!

112
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:01,690
My favourite reading:
Dante, Goethe and Nick Carter!

113
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,270
Sign of good taste!

114
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,970
The key!

115
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:36,760
Your testimony first.
I'll talk to Miss Karyn later.

116
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,550
Yes... at any time...

117
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,990
Here, I played his favourite song to put him
to sleep for the last time.

118
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,370
To put him to sleep?

119
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:19,371
He wouldn't sleep without it.
This was his favourite corner.

120
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:26,700
He loved the smell of flowers.
This is the only thing left of him.

121
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,690
- Yes?
- Nothing but his collar.

122
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:41,870
- Gert was a... dog?
- Yes. Only he understood me!

123
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:55,930
Sure. A dog's man's best friend, after all.
Please tell me everything.

124
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:07,110
That fateful evening,
I was getting ready to go to bed

125
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,940
at about 11,
helped as usual by my assistant.

126
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:15,741
Gert was doing the same.

127
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:26,070
When Karyn left the room, I locked all the
windows and doors, as Gert was terrified of robbers.

128
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:32,650
I made sure he was set up for the night,
not knowing I was seeing him for the last time.

129
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:39,740
- Sorry, sir...!
- Feelings like these require no excuses.

130
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,770
Thank you! Then I sat down

131
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:57,950
and started singing Gert's favourite
good-night song from Mozart.

132
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,240
It's my favourite, too!

133
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,870
The lady was ringing the bell madly.
I quickly ran over

134
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:59,110
and could hardly comprehend
at first what had happened.

135
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:03,700
But then I saw:
There was only Gert's collar!

136
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,640
Gert had disappeared
as if into thin air!

137
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:14,680
We looked everywhere... without luck.
Gert had gone!

138
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,310
Only then the Lady had pronounced
the saving word: "Carter!"

139
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,130
- Thanks, Miss! I have no more questions!
- Really? Pity....

140
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,510
- Good-bye, Miss Karyn!
- Yes!

141
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:51,440
- She's certainly fallen for you!
- Commissar! We're not at the pub!

142
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,460
How long ago...

143
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:28,061
Mysterious case.

144
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,850
- Dog?
- Disappeared!

145
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,590
- I know that even without you!
- Not that dog! The Italian! Sausage!

146
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:44,880
- It was here a moment ago!
- Enough! I'm in the middle of an investigation

147
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,610
and you are still only concerned about those...
What's that?

148
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,250
Paper! Greasy paper!

149
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:02,530
National Newspaper. My Italian was wrapped
in that newspaper.

150
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,370
It fell out of that flower! It ate the Italian
and spat the paper out!

151
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,650
An experienced crime investigator
does not jump to conclusions!

152
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,830
It must've eaten the dog, too!

153
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:31,720
- A daring hypothesis!
- Just look at it how it's perked up!

154
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,360
You bastard!
You like eating others' food, huh!

155
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:41,750
Don't let carried away by anger!
Now you'll find out by interrogation

156
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:48,280
how did this plant get here.
And I'll borrow this for my laboratory.

157
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,320
Looks like you're in demand,
my little one!

158
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,320
- Thank you! - Please order a big portion
of the Italians for my room!

159
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,010
Will do!

160
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,330
- Good afternoon! The Italians!
- About time. Put them on the table.

161
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:26,960
We were waiting for fresh ones, sir!
They'll just melt in your mouth!

162
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,650
And the smell! Just try it!

163
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:44,190
As you can see, it was no-one
of my personnel.

164
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:49,830
Yeah? And how about
that dwarf that's disappeared?

165
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,720
There's a black sheep in every flock....

166
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,560
Get the hell out you....
shepherd!

167
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,700
At your service!

168
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,290
Have you discovered anything new
in the palace, Commissar?

169
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:12,880
Nothing! No-one knows how the
plant got there.

170
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,770
We have lost the battle,
but we'll win the war!

171
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:27,050
This needs fresh air,
some draught beer,

172
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,730
and all will be well again!

173
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:36,340
Eat, Adela, eat!
You haven't eaten for a long time!

174
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,330
Lucky the dog was so big and meaty!

175
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,380
It doesn't pay for him to pee
on my leg!

176
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,960
At least we know now
what you can do!

177
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,730
So, has the detective
sniffed anything out yet?

178
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,210
Chloroform, sir!

179
00:33:10,211 --> 00:33:12,111
Sorry, sir!

180
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:18,500
To be frank, I don't wish to
meet Nick!

181
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,940
Impossible, sir,
I have his everys step under observation!

182
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,130
Bravo!
Here, hold this!

183
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,020
Now I'll start the revenge!

184
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,060
Grandpa! Look, grandpa!

185
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,950
The General Butterfly, grandpa!

186
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,940
Admiral, my dear, Admiral!

187
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:53,220
- And what've you caught, grandpa?
- Nothing much; I'm an old man after all...

188
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,560
But you look so healthy, grandpa!

189
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:06,690
- What's this? I don't know this...
Well, let's see... - "Hosalba Dexteri"...

190
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:13,430
on a Czech paddock,
Rare, yet explicable.

191
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:21,810
Tiny seeds of this plant have been
brought to Egypt in the digestive system

192
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,900
of Pastejrik Kostrbaty - the favourite food source
of Raroch Vltivy, which winters there

193
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,630
and then transfers them on its beak
back to our homeland!

194
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,770
Almighty Nature!
I see you are also a botanist!

195
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,740
Baron Robert von Kratzmar?

196
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,480
Private doctor of Faust University
in Wienerschnitzelberg?

197
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,470
Oh my god! Such an honour!

198
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:09,650
Let me introduce my granddaugter
Miss Kvetuse Bockova.

199
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:19,180
And my name's Albin Bocek, retired professor
of botany and zoology.

200
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:27,510
You are the author of the collossal work
"Flowers of the Jindrichohradec area"?

201
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:35,090
- Sins of one's youth, Baron!
- Leave the Baron, my dear colleague!

202
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:39,930
I'd be honoured
if you would autograph this copy.

203
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:44,310
But of course! I'd be delighted to welcome
the Baron...

204
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:50,111
colleague, in my modest abode.

205
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:58,340
We'll look through some books,
drink some coffee and eat some apple pie,

206
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:04,580
that Kvetus has made. May I hope
my dear colleague?...

207
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:11,910
Books, coffee and apple pie?
I can't wait! See you tonight!

208
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:18,100
That mysterious plant! The solution
to the dog's disappearance...

209
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,940
- The dog's eaten!
- But Commissar! A sausage is not the same

210
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:29,020
as a dog the size of a calf!
There is no plant big enough

211
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:35,260
to manage such a big bite!
True, I did know someone who...

212
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,750
No! Impossible! He's been dead
for a long time!

213
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:47,670
The fresh air certainly does miracles!
The aromatic gardens, the lilacs....

214
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:59,810
- What's that?
- Olomouc cheese. Nicely decomposed.

215
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,440
Europe is decomposing...

216
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:13,120
Grandpa! The Mineral Butterfly!

217
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:27,340
- General, my darling! I mean... Admiral!
- Yellow Butterfly, grandpa...

218
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,200
Quiet...

219
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:22,660
My girl... you're home!

220
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:26,861
The gentlemen kindly ordered a cab.

221
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:34,590
This is Mr Josef Ledvina, the maker of stripes
and this is Mr Nick Ledvina, Czecho-American,

222
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:40,730
currently visiting the old country.
By the way, have you happened to meet

223
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:46,410
young Matejka in America?
He's the stepson of my sister-in-law.

224
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,011
I haven't had the pleasure.

225
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:54,200
I work as a Magician. Walking out into
the street I had left my work hat on

226
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,690
...and the misfortune was done.

227
00:38:56,891 --> 00:39:01,191
No, Mr Magician!
It was all due to my collector's weakness...

228
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:06,270
I am a bit shaken up... excuse me....

229
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:12,400
Gentlemen - please, sit down!

230
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:22,840
Professor, may I ask a question relating to your field?
It concerns an exotic plant.

231
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:31,920
Exotic plant? My friend! I only know the
Czech plants! But if you wait here for an hour,

232
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,950
you will be answered by the foremost expert
in just that area!

233
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:46,280
- In the meantime, I'll bring some dandelion wine!
- Dandelion?

234
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:57,360
It's a true elixir of youth! I have some every day and
being almost 80, my heart beats like a bell still!

235
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:04,100
- And liver like a rock!
- What else awaits me here?...

236
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,530
Commissar! Who's that?

237
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:17,860
- Some boy... and he's drawing graffiti
on the wall. - Or a masked dwarf!

238
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:24,050
- Always alert, Commissar! That's why
you'll go down to the pub. - Sure!

239
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:33,080
- And you won't let the street out of your sight!
- Well, they have some rubbish on tap there,

240
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:38,260
but it still beats some dandelion poison!

241
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:16,330
Welcome, dear collegue Baron!
What a visit!

242
00:41:16,531 --> 00:41:18,531
I'll take him to the study, my girl.

243
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,660
- Have you wiped the dust off there?
- Of course, grandpa!

244
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:34,890
Mr Magician, may I show you
my butterfly collection?

245
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,430
I'd be honoured....

246
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:53,200
Let us celebrate science,
but mainly botany!

247
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:01,930
- Are you also a poet?
- Sometimes I tease the Muse!

248
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:09,770
- But permanently I'm involved only with
God's plants! - You've been busy!

249
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:18,040
The gem of Kargasovice paddocks:
Peterka Pidlakova!

250
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:28,470
- Plum jam Pidlak!
- Amazing!

251
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:38,400
- I know. You have even more beautiful
butterflies in America. - Yes, we do!

252
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:48,380
Well, we're a country of unlimited opportunity!
But I've found the most beatiful butterfly here!

253
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:10,980
- Watch the step, collegue Baron!
- Good evening, sir!

254
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,310
Your servant, Miss!

255
00:43:15,611 --> 00:43:20,111
- The pride of my glasshouse!
- You didn't need to....

256
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:30,090
Every inch of this place is warmed up
by the touch of the female hand!

257
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:33,120
Kvetus's good at housework...

258
00:43:33,121 --> 00:43:37,521
and not just using her hands!
Last year she made a whole drum of sourkraut!

259
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:47,900
And now, would you bring the coffee, my girl.
Come and join us!

260
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,020
This is the Czech-American magician.

261
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:28,860
- Pleased to meet you!
- Excuse me, Baron; have we met before?

262
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:36,140
- Gentlemen, to the table!
- What's wrong, Baron?

263
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,030
Migraine. An inherited curse of my family!

264
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:46,520
- You need some dandelion wine!
- No, no. Only the solitude of my bedroom

265
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,900
will deliver relief. Terrible illness
tortures my family for centuries!

266
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,690
Yes, degenerative diseases like this
are no fun!

267
00:44:57,189 --> 00:45:00,689
I'd be honoured if you and Kvetus

268
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:06,420
came to visit me at home. You'll see an unusual
sight - feeding of a carnivorous plant!

269
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:11,960
- Carnivourous! Amazing! I'll look forward to that!
- No more than myself!

270
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,640
So, day after tomorrow at 3 pm
I'll send my cab!

271
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:25,070
- Baron! - After you, boy!
- Thanks, sir!

272
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:40,700
Do you know who was at the old dummy's house?
You idiot! Carter was there!

273
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:47,180
Why am I paying your spies? Why?
I'll take the cost of this stick out of your pay!

274
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:55,610
- See you later, Miss!
- See you, Nick, on Friday; you promised!

275
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:01,100
- We'll have strawberry dumplings!
- The sweetest strawberies are your lips!

276
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:09,030
- You may pick them, Nick!
- Kvetus, come and rub my back!

277
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,020
Bye, Nick!...

278
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:28,840
When you've squeezed that sore,
I'll tell you who I've seen here.

279
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,020
I'd like to know how he found me...
It's obvious, he wants to take over my victim!

280
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,910
- You must act fast!
- Murder him, sir?

281
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:49,190
- No! You'll deliver him alive! I want to feed!
- Feed? Where, sir?

282
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:55,230
- On Carter!
- Who does the Baron remind me of?

283
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:02,860
Nice Baron! When he thinks no-one can see him
he's as rude as an old criminal!

284
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,440
Criminal?

285
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,870
- Our saviour!
- What's that?

286
00:47:14,871 --> 00:47:18,671
The Criminal Bible!
An album of international crooks.

287
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:31,540
- I'm not disturbing you?
- Not at all!

288
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,360
Pardon!

289
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,470
No! That's impossible!

290
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:24,830
- But it is him! - Who?
- The Gardener!

291
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:34,760
The most mysterious criminal of this century.
His true identity and his origins are not known.

292
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:43,030
He earned the nickname "Gardener" by his
botanical experiments. Commissar!

293
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:51,270
He appeared out of the Amazonian jungle
where he'd lived with the local Indians.

294
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:55,060
As you see, marked by a cross.
The local shaman introduced him

295
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:01,390
to a carnivourous plant the locals used
to sacrifice the hearts of their captive enemies.

296
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:09,630
When it got sick and lost its appetite,
it got cured by an extract made out

297
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:14,570
of the magician,
and he became his successor.

298
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:22,350
Later on, in the USA, he grew a fast-sprouting
bean, and would use it to get lifted to

299
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:24,690
apartment windows so he could rob them.

300
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:32,230
In California he married a widow of an Apple King
and then got involved in fruit growing.

301
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:37,810
The result of his experiments?
A heavy-duty granny smith!

302
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:47,390
Universal heritage! He put asleep the famous
actress Bara Sernarova by the use of

303
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:52,080
a thorn from a special rose.
But he did not hesitate to use her.

304
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:58,910
Terrible...
And is this rose available on the market?

305
00:49:58,911 --> 00:50:02,711
No. Thank god, it's not!

306
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:07,800
All these plants have been the secret
of his devilish glasshouse!

307
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,240
Only I stopped his rule of terror!
I surrounded him and pushed him to a swamp,

308
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:20,120
where he ended his miserable life.
Or so I believed till last night,

309
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:28,350
when we stood face to face.
I have no doubt it's him who smuggled

310
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:33,140
a carnivourous plant into the bedroom
of Duke Tuna's wife.

311
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:40,380
The plant that ate her dog.
Which concludes the case of Gert, the dog.

312
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,610
- Congratulations!
- Just a moment! The best comes last.

313
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:51,700
- Commissar!
- Observe well!

314
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:58,520
Look at that, Baron Kraztmar!

315
00:51:05,221 --> 00:51:07,021
You're not trying to say that...

316
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:15,800
Exactly! Baron Kratzmar and The Gardener
are one and the same man!

317
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:24,830
- A close friend of Lady Tunova, a scientist,
a philantropist? Impossible!

318
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:31,810
- You've said yourself The Gardener drowned!
- I must have been wrong then!

319
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:42,890
Then? Perhaps you are mistaken now, too!
Mr Carter, we are all fallible.

320
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:50,570
Excuse me. I'm expected at an execution!
Not my own, of course!

321
00:51:50,771 --> 00:51:52,271
Good bye.

322
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:58,200
Just a moment!

323
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:04,290
This is a sensitive case!
May I expect your co-operation?

324
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:12,510
Mr Carter, you work alone, don't you?
I respect....

325
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:27,040
You flirt!... Good-bye!

326
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,890
Watch out for bombs!

327
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:47,790
- What's that?
- A present from my friend Roentgen.

328
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:06,550
- A ticket! Interesting!
Commissar! We're off! - Where to?

329
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:12,390
- To the night club!
- Always ready!

330
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:24,210
And now, the secret of Night Prague!
An artiste incognito!

331
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:44,710
Yes! Irma the Cat!

332
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:46,940
- This is Virgin!
- This is... - Eagle! - This is Eagle!

333
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,080
Invited to the artiste's change room.
Act as per instructions!

334
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,470
- Yes! Yes!
- Virgin's disconnecting!

335
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,510
Very interesting!

336
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,430
You've written these words to me:

337
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:50,970
Do you know what you don't know?
What do you know that I don't know?

338
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:57,160
- This!
- Miss Karyn!

339
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:03,190
- Yes.
- So you are living two lives?

340
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:07,430
Just two?
A cat has seven lives.

341
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,860
Thanks.
A detective must keep a clear head.

342
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:23,250
You have that... and not just clear...
but also classically perfect head!

343
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:30,330
But...my reputation...
I mean, your reputation!

344
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:33,920
- I don't care! - No!
- Yes!

345
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:42,900
Prove that you're a man!
Or aren't you?

346
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:48,240
Excuse me!
And what about this?

347
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:54,770
Or...

348
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:10,390
- Now you can throw yourself at me...
- Yes!

349
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,220
So that's it!...

350
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,450
- You fell in your own trap!
- You dog!

351
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:34,190
We'll get to the dog, too!
First, tell me how the carnivourous plant

352
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:37,580
...found itself in the Lady's bedroom.
- I know nothing!

353
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:43,220
- But I think you do!
- You need to be tough with such as her.

354
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:48,650
- A gentleman treats a woman as a lady, Commissar!
- As you wish!

355
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:56,430
Damn!

356
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:05,460
Well...
Who brought the monster to the bedroom?

357
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:18,740
Please, don't! It's from Paris!
I did. I brought it inside.

358
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,670
And Baron Kratzmar
gave it to you, didn't he?

359
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:35,550
- Yes. - And why?
- So he could use Gert as an experiment

360
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:39,440
...with Adela. - Adela?
- That's what he called the plant.

361
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:43,480
- And what experiment?
- He trained Adela in such a way so as

362
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:51,970
to maximize its carnivourous abilities
by listening to Gert's going to sleep song.

363
01:00:52,670 --> 01:01:00,640
- Poor Mozart! And why did he select Gert?
- Because... I don't know.

364
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,770
Thank you!

365
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:13,160
Well?

366
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:29,630
Stop! Because... the dog was
the size of a human.

367
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:38,110
So this was just a rehearsal...
The next victim, or rather the next lunch...

368
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:42,400
...is to be a person, isn't it?
- Yes!

369
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,740
- Do you know who?
- Yes.

370
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:53,530
- So, who is it?
- OK...

371
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:56,870
- It's...
- You traitor!

372
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:06,250
- Hands up!
- Please, as you wish!

373
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:08,980
And fast!

374
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:21,420
- Armour!
- So we've lost!

375
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:28,350
No we haven't!
A present from my friend Alfred Nobel!

376
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:30,790
Thanks very much!

377
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:40,470
Get down!

378
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:49,750
Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!

379
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:53,940
Pretty strong tobacco...!

380
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:02,920
- Hands up! Or I'll shoot!
- Excuse me!

381
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:09,610
- Good evening, Kvetuska!
- Nick! What are you doing here?

382
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:15,500
Friend and I are playing Cops and Robbers.

383
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:22,780
In the sewage pipes? You men!
You're like little kids!

384
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:32,410
I must run. Before the beer gets flat;
Grandpa would tell me off. Good night!

385
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:37,320
So, by the strawberry dumplings
at 12 o'clock!

386
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:44,180
Always ready!

387
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,140
What are we to do in the cupboard?

388
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:02,539
I'll suffocate here!

389
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:10,620
It's necessary. There are too many
ears and eyes around us!

390
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:17,060
- Here there's too much naphtaline!
- Commissar, we're going to attack!

391
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:22,250
- First I'll take a look at the Baron's.
- You might as well get your funeral organized!

392
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:29,430
Not necessary. If he's sure I'm here,
he won't be expecting me.

393
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:35,120
- You're going to split in half?
- Sort of. You'll be the first half.

394
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:44,300
- I'd rather stay in one piece.
- But you will. Only not as Commissar Ledvina.

395
01:06:55,560 --> 01:07:00,540
- What's that?
- Work clothes. - This?

396
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:09,130
- Once more: When I leave, you will...
- I'll make myself visible by the window,

397
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:14,210
...so it appears you're still here.
- Right!

398
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:24,290
- It's not safe for you outside, Mr Carter!
See you later! - Let's hope so!

399
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:18,730
Would you happen to have a match?

400
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:00,730
You're under arrest, Gardener!

401
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:10,040
Hi, Robert! So you're the most mysterious
criminal of the century!

402
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:15,470
- Franz, you know everything, don't you?
- Not me, Mr Carter!

403
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:27,340
We've got him, sir! In a barrel!

404
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:33,920
High time! I won't charge you
for that broken stick!

405
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:29,760
- Our Diogenes! Open it!
- Yes, sir!

406
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:46,770
- You won't stop my revenge now, you bastard!
- What to do with him, sir?

407
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:51,110
- Adela hasn't had her dinner yet!
- Let her work on her appetite!

408
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:58,800
Tomorrow she'll have two courses for lunch!
Carter will be the second one!

409
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:05,030
- The second one?
- And what about the Miss, sir?

410
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:08,570
- She's yours!
- Thank you, sir!

411
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:17,250
I'll prepare such fate for her
that's worse than death!

412
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:28,280
- And then I'll sell her to a South American bordello!
- That's it! Sweet dreams!

413
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:35,710
- You sniffing bastard! - Come sir,
an injured thumb must be fixed right away!

414
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:06,490
If we rub a carbon pole with a fox's tail,
student Carter...

415
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:31,030
You don't like electric shocks, little one....

416
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:46,900
I'm to be the second...
but who's first?

417
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:56,680
No; I'll strike at the right time.

418
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:03,120
Little bit of patience, pardner!
That'll be some day tomorrow!

419
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,550
Can't see myself
eating strawberry dumplings...

420
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:33,650
Good evening!

421
01:16:39,249 --> 01:16:41,049
Welcome, Nick.

422
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:44,890
You look like you're coming straight
from a magician's performance!

423
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:54,370
- Yes. And sorry I'm coming through the window.
- That's the American way of life! Sit down!

424
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:58,500
Thanks. Alas, my attire makes it
impossible to sit comfortably.

425
01:16:58,501 --> 01:17:02,301
You can speak loudly;
Grandpa won't wake now.

426
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:07,440
I came to apologize.
I can't have dumplings tomorrow.

427
01:17:08,241 --> 01:17:12,641
You must. You are not going
to spoil Grandpa's big day!

428
01:17:12,742 --> 01:17:13,842
Big day?

429
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:19,820
The Baron's invited him to his palace.
He promised to show him plants that eat meat.

430
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,810
Grandpa...
...will be the first course!

431
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:26,000
- Beg your pardon?
- Nothing. Go on.

432
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:31,190
Grandpa's looking forward to it. And me too,
the nice Mr Baron's invited me, too!

433
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:41,520
South American bordello...
I'll come to have some dumplings, Kvetuska.

434
01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:49,290
- Can you keep a secret?
- I'm a daughter of Jan Zizka's nation!

435
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:58,320
Well, I am, or rather I'm not...
Magician Ledvina.

436
01:17:59,521 --> 01:18:04,921
I'm Nick Carter,
the famous American detective.

437
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:10,350
The MOST famous one... and...

438
01:18:10,951 --> 01:18:13,551
what's a detective?

439
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:17,480
Do you want to save your Grandpa's life?

440
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:26,910
You're sucking my blood
for the last time today....

441
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:31,450
Let's raise our glasses
to a successful tomorrow!

442
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:37,090
- You can drink from the bottle.
- Thank you, sir!

443
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:32,320
Sir!

444
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:42,400
Before Adela shows what it can do,
we'll have a cup of tea. Sit down, please.

445
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:51,130
- Would Miss like some sweet dreams?
- Oh yes!

446
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:57,510
I'll suggest a cup of tea
from mysterious Tibet.

447
01:19:58,610 --> 01:20:06,250
Sweet dreams are a reward for its sour taste.
And my colleague? Ceylon, Chinese...

448
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:10,380
...Indian, Darjeeling?
- Do you have rosebud tea? No?

449
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,130
I'll leave it up to you then.

450
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:15,110
Help yourselves to sugar! My Rose Kratzmarentzis
is not yet able to do such precise tasks.

451
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:23,090
- Amazing!
- Just a joke! Let's not get our tea go cold.

452
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:28,730
Excuse me, dear colleague, but how did you
manage to achieve such amazing results?

453
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:30,660
How?

454
01:22:49,659 --> 01:22:58,859
Oh my god! What am I seeing?
A report card from Jindrichuv Hradec High School!

455
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:04,250
- A school I taught at in my youth!
- Do you know that that school

456
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:08,880
was attended by a student, who would not recognize
a leaf of Supatka Jeleni from its stalk?

457
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:13,820
- No! - You let him fail.
- I did the right thing, then!

458
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:21,560
Poor student! Everyone laughed at him!
Even Fanynka Mrchackova.

459
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:28,840
Do you remember her? Well developed for her age.
She used to carry stuffed animals to your cupboard.

460
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:35,280
- Those were the days!
- The poor boy swore he would avenge himself

461
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:41,620
using your own weapons! Not only he drilled
botany like mad, he even became a criminal,

462
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:47,050
to obtain the means for his expensive experiments!
What a hard job that was!

463
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:52,740
Keep calm, colleague!
And what was the student's name?

464
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:59,520
Matej Kracmera? I don't remember!
Then look at me!

465
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,060
- You are?...
- Yes!

466
01:24:01,961 --> 01:24:07,361
Baron Robert von Kratzmar,
the flunked student Kracmera!

467
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:17,890
The time of revenge has come!
Here, you can eat the Fail mark, old man!

468
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:24,520
And be quick, Adela's hungry!
You'll be in good company there!

469
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:05,120
Keep chewing! Enjoy!
Always ready!

470
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:27,680
- The game's over, Gardener!
- The sleuth!

471
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:32,110
- But what devil saved you from the swamp?
- This one!

472
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:42,550
The surface had closed over me,
when I felt the firm bottom below.

473
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:47,430
Just the tiny opening of this smoking utensil
kept my contact with life!

474
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:51,370
It was a fragile connection,
but it allowed me to hang onto life.

475
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:56,660
And this will ensure the noose for you!

476
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:11,280
- I'm giving you a raise!
- Should I use her now or later, sir?

477
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:18,460
- One after the other!
First, we'll feed Adela the detective. - Yes, sir!

478
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,940
That guy needs a truck to move him!

479
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:58,390
Sorry about that!

480
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:36,610
- Just a moment!
- Thank you!

481
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:38,700
Say hello to the devil, Gardener!

482
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:45,990
- Materiel fatigue! What now?
- Do I get three guesses?

483
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:50,870
- No need!
- How primitive!

484
01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:54,960
But how effective! Enjoy the view!
Soon you'll see the ground from up close!

485
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:58,500
But that's not going to be quite the same!

486
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:07,490
- How're you doing?
- Thank you, good so far!

487
01:35:44,410 --> 01:35:51,790
Remember, Commissar: To admit one's defeat
is also a victory of a kind.

488
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:56,030
So in fact we've won! Romped it in!

489
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:13,530
That's impossible.

490
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:24,910
- Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- Stay calm, Commissar! Always ready!

491
01:36:27,910 --> 01:36:33,040
- What's that?
- A solar gun.

492
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:41,460
A present from my friend Laser.
A test run first.

493
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:39,900
- Even heaven's against us!
- So what's new? A present from my friend Messer.

494
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,850
- Robert!
- Yes...

495
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:52,980
Mr Carter!
No doubt you're coming to congratulate me!

496
01:38:55,480 --> 01:39:02,660
- Thank you! - Mr Carter! Gert,
meet America's most famous detective!

497
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:06,750
Director, introduce him to the gentleman.

498
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:13,240
A message from Egypt. Urgent!

499
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:22,510
The Great Pyramid... disappeared?
When's the next Orient Express departing?

500
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:34,090
There's no other way, Kvetuska.
The Great Pyramid's calling me

501
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:41,680
...and it's not interested in what my heart says.
- I understand, Nick. Only you can solve such a mystery.

502
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:48,010
Commissar!
You can still decide to come!

503
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:51,550
It's kind of you,
but what would I do in Egypt?

504
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:55,990
They might have Pilsen, but they're bound
not to know how to pour it!

505
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:05,170
Professor!
I'll never forget your dandelion wine!

506
01:40:19,290 --> 01:40:25,820
- And if you ever meet Ladislav Matejka
in America... - That's me!

507
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:32,510
Larry Matejka, Czech-American!

508
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:44,710
"Egyptian Quick and Easy"

509
01:40:45,305 --> 01:40:51,579
