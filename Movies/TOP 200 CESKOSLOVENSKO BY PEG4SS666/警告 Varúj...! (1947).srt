made on them lately.

35
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,051
Its crew wants to break the record
for round-the-world flight,

36
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,148

After 11 hours, after refuelling
in Newfoundland,

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,630
the airplane lands in Paris.

43
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,873
As it was not allowed
to fly over the Soviet Union.

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,591
The crew had to fly 6,400 kilometres
further than Hughes.

45
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,471
The plane took the Pathé newsreel

49
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,685

50
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,115

record by 12 hours.

We give a part of his speech.

62
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,990
Czechs and Slovaks created
a joint state by making huge sacrifices.

63
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,242
They will build it together
and sustain it together.

64
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,848
The Czechoslovak Republic

65
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:53,269
guarantees peace. gives protection,
guards our rights and freedoms.

66
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,479
Progress, development, civilisation,
prosperity,

67
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,531
and thus will create the conditions
for the happiness of the people.

68
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,355
We live and fall by the common state.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,631
We have to be prepared to make
any sacrifice for it.

70
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,872
We have fought and died for it.

71
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,648
If necessary, we will fight
for it again

72
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,193
voluntarily, from our conviction.
and if need be, even die for it.

73
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,170
Berlin.

74
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,039
The crime rate shot up
dramatically in Berlin.

75
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,789
Military police of all
four superpowers

76
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,794
organised a raid together with
thousands of German security guards.

77
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,645
On the first day they
arrested thousands of Germans.

78
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,758
But let many go after interrogation.

79
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,687
However. it seems that they
caught many of the worst criminals.

80
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,809
New weapons were shown
at the American Army Day.

81
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,513
This vehicle fights against fire.

82
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,435
A huge howitzer with missiles
that can destroy the strongest bulwark.

83
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,001
Mother planes release
small fast fighters.

84
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,962
Paratroopers are largely
emphasised.

85
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,638
Tons of military material are released
on parachutes after the soldiers.

86
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,963
Leading statesmen fight for peace.

87
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,916
Why are weapons prepared
that compel us to think of war?

88
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,371
Don't we all sincerely want peace?

89
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,969
We will show you a highly
cultural sport in Paris.

90
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,715
Women's roller skating race.

91
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,556
You will see how ladies can change.

92
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,407
One can get very upset at sports.

93
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,519
No wonder that some lose their temper.
especially when they lose.

94
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,229
But enough is enough.

95
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,709
Sometimes even the referee is weak.

96
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,519
And his trousers too.

97
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,162
Well. ladies' sport.

98
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,277

Directed by:

113
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,555
Before the First World War Slovakia
was called Upper Hungary.

114
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,275
What was good and big enough
belonged to the lords.

115
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,392
Hill people had to work hard.

116
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,956
“A Slovak is not a human being!"
Hailed one slogan.

117
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,767
Many oppressed Slovaks
ran away to the world.

118
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,556
Some were successful, others vanished
into thin air.

119
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,642
Through their destiny, they fulfilled
the sad history of emigrants.

120
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,995
This is the story of Ondrej Muranica,
who was one the millions of Slovaks

121
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,647
wandering the world
in search of bread...

122
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,471
Beware!

123
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,873
Beware!

124
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,796
Coming from the low end!

125
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,921
He escaped again!

126
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,951
Load up!

127
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,288
Everything.
The shepherd's share as well.

128
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,834
It's already the fifth.

129
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,150
It's a pity.

130
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,955
I'll get him!

131
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,928
Take it! Take some for sheep tenders too!
Quickly!

132
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,191
And what shall I give the boys to eat?

133
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,203
I thought about it, too.

134
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,831
The high lord said
they could drink sheep milk.

135
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,681
The bear allegedly steals your sheep.

136
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,399
It's necessary to compensate the lord
for the sheep and the lost profit.

137
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,722
And a shepherd is not a man?

138
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,952
Mi§o, take what belongs to us!

139
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,044
I warn you, shepherd Ondrej,
you'll regret it!

140
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,159
You can't take what belongs to us!

141
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,806
It's impossible to live like this.

142
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,926
With a master like this.
we'll never have anything.

143
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,608
Lords have always existed
and will continue to exist.

144
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,761
Who knows?

145
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,330
Tell your man if it happens again,
he'll have to go.

146
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,802
Ondrej cannot help it,
the bear takes his sheep.

147
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,315
Why doesn't the lord shoot the bear'?

148
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,008
You can't order him.
He knows what he's doing.

149
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,755
Does he live from your work
or do you live from his?

150
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,835
He takes your field
and sends your man to jail!

151
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,531
Mom, what shall we do now?

152
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,115
Ondrej will tell you.

153
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,969
Mom. can I go with you?

154
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,524
Dad!

155
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,591
My son!

156
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,401
- And mom?
- She's coming.

157
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,550
It's sharp.

158
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,003
- It's for the bear.
- And will you kill it?

159
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,007
Iwill...

160
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,916
And how?

161
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,674
Wait.

162
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,045
This way.

163
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,607
The farmer visited us.

164
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,927
What again?

165
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,278
The lord doesn't believe that the bear
takes the sheep. He wants to lock you up.

166
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,364
He wants to take our small field too.

167
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,712
Why?

168
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,632
He can do whatever he pleases.

169
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,518
He can do whatever he pleases.

170
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,432
What can you do against him alone?

171
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,251
I already know what I'll do.

172
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,799
Miéo, take this sheep to
the master's hall.

173
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,272
Let him choke on it,
if he doesn't believe me!

174
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,320
Stop it!

175
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,832
Gypsy, tune the violin!

176
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,956
There's a gentian for Mrnéa,
and give my regards to him.

177
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,042
A little cheese for mom and tell her
to take good care of herself.

178
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,953
- God bless you.
- Good-bye.

179
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,250
- Come!
- I'll stay with my father.

180
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,359
- Good.
- Good-bye.

181
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,636
At the hall, they only have banquets,
dinner after dinner,

182
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,728
and we don't have anything to eat.

183
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,689
We have bad times.

184
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,242
Only we can help ourselves.

185
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,189
We have to maintain discipline,

186
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,035
and not escape like today's
young people.

187
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,249
Agents permanently recruit people
to America.

188
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,563
America, America...

189
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,080
The locals run away
and foreigners barge in.

190
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,519
Well, if one leaves then so will another.

191
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,159
The strong blood flows out,

192
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,164
the weak stays here.

193
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,923
Sleep well.

194
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,521
- God bless you!
- May God help!

195
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,605
Welcome Mi§o!
Did you bring cheese?

196
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,445
Ondrej sends you cheese,

197
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,676
and also some herbs.

198
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,131
And who did it to you?

199
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,091
The master.

200
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,710
I brought him a message from Ondrej,

201
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,771
and he answered like this.

202
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,091
A new era of hope is coming
sometime soon.

203
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,675
Beware! Come on!

204
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,189
Beware!

205
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,529
Women, back off!

206
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,641
It's not a childbirth, the guy needs
a drink.

207
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,155
Ondrej...

208
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,489
Didn't I say so?

209
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,076
He'll be fit within a few days.

210
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,515
No, it shouldn't be like this.

211
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,887
They say in America, it's different.

212
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,089
Who knows?
Masters are everywhere.

213
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,992
They are.

214
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,755
But fellow-countrymen earn well there.

215
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,928
Maco Korefi wrote.

216
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,449
He has sent money to his wife,
he works in the mine.

217
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,398
Underground.

218
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,752
He doesn't even see the sun.

219
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,878
And who knows if he'll return.

220
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,443
Why not! And he brings home
a few dollars.

221
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,642
I wish I could earn a few thousand.
to help my family.

222
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,950
To buy some plough-land...

223
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,410
lt's possible only in America.

224
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,075
Could you change a mountain
into a dark mine?

225
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,444
Do you really prefer working here

226
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,519
for free, just for sheep milk?

227
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,440
Good afternoon!

228
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,436
What are you bringing us?

229
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,152
We are coming for the bear's skin.
The master wants it!

230
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,631
He took the sheep out of my wage,

231
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,031
I killed the bear,
the skin is mine!

232
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,431
So you won't give it us willingly!?

233
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,952
No, I won't!

234
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,967
If you don't. we are going to take it!

235
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,390
Then take it!

236
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,441
Right.

237
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,287
Then get out of the shed!
This very day!

238
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,046
The handle must be smooth.

239
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,397
Try it.

240
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,167
It's good.

241
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,637
Now, I'm going to show you how
my father killed the bear.

242
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,955
He aimed, then he smashed!

243
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,795
And the bear was killed.

244
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,349
Will you show me how? Then go!

245
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,205
And where is the bear?

246
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,829
Over there!

247
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,801
What have you done?

248
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,167
They wanted me to kill the bear.

249
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:53,953
Ondrej killed the pot

250
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,250
instead of the bear!

251
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,793
He'll be no better than his father.

252
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,487
You'll see, one day he'll kill a bear too.

253
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,551
You brigand of brigands.

254
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,246
I wish it weren't worse!

255
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,109
And I'll mend those cookers.

256
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,689
And what next?

257
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,080
I'll go to America.

258
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,121
- To America?
- Yes, to America.

259
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,115
Well, good-bye!

260
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,076
Bye.

261
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,246
Wait, I'll go too!

262
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,762
When I return, we'll build a
new house,

263
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,049
you'll have a nice garden
in front of the house

264
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,726
and I'll be a shepherd again.

265
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,358
That's easy for you to say.
But what will happen to us?

266
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,400
Have you thought about it?

267
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,166
- You've got a son.
- That's just it!

268
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,685
I want you to live better.

269
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,233
We will. if you stay.

270
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,110
If you leave, I'll end my life.

271
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,396
Mom, do you hear how much
she loves me?

272
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:14,039
The cross shows God's love.

273
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,290
Don't be afraid.

274
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,489
We'll be back in two years.

275
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,236
Everything is going to be alright.
We will have a farewell dance.

276
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,875
Mom, why didn't you tell him?
He obeys you!

277
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,601
All is in vain, he'll leave.

278
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,881
- For America?
- Come what may.

279
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,729
- He cannot leave!
- He'll leave and he'll return.

280
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,352
So, take courage!

281
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,361
Look at Mi§ko!

282
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,076
But he's unmarried.

283
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,002
I'm not afraid of the master!

284
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,640
I'm not afraid of being,
I'm not afraid of living,

285
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,360
I'm not afraid of the master!

286
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,036
Yankees are dancing.

287
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,796
They're saying good-bye but
how will they return...

288
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,448
Eva, my wife!

289
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:09,803
Mountain, don't feel sorrow for me!

290
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,435
Since I'm coming back

291
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:33,438
to you from beyond the sea.

292
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,394
Now a prayer for Dad.

293
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,997
Dear God, save my father,

294
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,037
deliver him from evil,

295
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,636
and bring him back to us soon
in good health. Amen.

296
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,472
I can't, Ondrej.

297
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,526
I can't breathe here.

298
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,570
I've got terrible chest pain.

299
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,313
Let's get out of here!

300
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,029
We'll go, Miéko.

301
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,158
We'll find a betterjob.

302
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,810
- God bless you, my fellow-countrymen!
- Bless you. Mr. Gregor!

303
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,405
How do you like it here?

304
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,962
It's good. thank you.

305
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,249
I think it was better with the sheep.

306
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,564
You'll get used to it.
The first five years are the worst.

307
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,247
- Good-bye my friends!
- Good-bye Mr. Gregor!

308
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,649
If you are going to write home,
send greetings to my homeland.

309
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,709
All right!

310
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,607
I live with Miéo. I earn good money.

311
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,090
After the next salary
I'll send you some money.

312
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,643
If God helps me, I'll be back soon.

313
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,634
I'll be back soon...

314
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,405
I'll be back soon.

315
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,202
There are lots of our countn/men,
our engineer is a native from home.

316
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,442
His name is Gregor.

317
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,921
I think of you all the time,

318
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,449
of you and mother,

319
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:39,879
of Ondrejko and all of you at home.

320
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,246
Beware!

321
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,678
Ondrei!

322
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:18,912
Halloo!

323
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,674
A terrible disaster has happened!

324
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,070
A dangerous situation!

325
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,208
The wall didn't hold!

326
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,112
Halloo!

327
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,238
You must go right away!
Can you hear me? Right away!

328
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,166
And get rid of evennhing!
None of the papers should be found!

329
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,834
Ziliak!

330
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,008
Mommy...

331
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,771
Mr. foreman!

332
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:00,230
Our Father. who art in heaven...

333
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:06,961
as we forgive those
who trespass against us

334
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,647
and lead us not into temptation,

335
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,195
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.

336
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,557
Can't you pray?

337
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,678
- I can.
- So, then!

338
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:28,045
Our Father, who art in heaven.
hallowed be thy name...

339
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,251
Our Father. who art in heaven...

340
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:46,089
...in heaven...
-... in heaven!

341
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,562
What's the matter with my son?

342
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,156
I locked him up so he could learn
how to pray.

343
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,153
Ondrejko can pray.

344
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,924
In Hungarian?

345
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,790
No, the way we learnt from
our parents.

346
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,645
What are you thinking about?

347
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,731
Whether or not kids in America
go to school too?

348
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,689
Of course.

349
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,990
And they also learn Hungarian there?

350
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,208
Of course not!

351
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,489
They learn in the language they speak,
in American.

352
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:39,565
Why do they teach us a different
language than the one we speak?

353
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,075
The masters have decided it.

354
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,767
They say they want you
to be more clever.

355
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:50,562
If you want to catch a bird
you have to lure with a nice sing...

356
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,395
I am not that kind of bird!

357
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,800
Eva, come a bit closer!

358
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,924
What again?

359
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,243
You won't be moving this field
next spring.

360
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,563
Mara Garaj will get it.

361
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,850
They have you for a cheeky Pan-Slavic.

362
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,768
- Is that all?
- I'll also give you some advice.

363
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,276
Mara will get it because she
sent her son to Hungary.

364
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,590
If you send your son to Hungary,

365
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:51,004
the master will leave you the field,
and you could work at his hall.

366
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,275
That's how things work.

367
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,351
Don't worry, he'll feel good.

368
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,842
My son also went to school in
Budapest for six years.

369
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,197
And when he returned.
you couldn't talk to him.

370
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,715
He rejected you even more!

371
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:08,192
My Ondrej won't have a Hungarian name,
even if I have to starve!

372
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,283
Nothing.

373
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,770
Ifeel like choking...

374
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,838
If the light is on
nothing can happen to you.

375
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:38,029
We've already been here for 34 hours.

376
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,594
It's a shift.

377
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,874
It's already dawn up above.

378
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,170
And the guys are going on a new shift.

379
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,756
Why don't they make themselves heard?

380
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,844
We can't hear them yet.

381
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,518
They are far. But they'll come.

382
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,842
Get out fast!

383
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,072
We've got to leave.
The wall is starting to crack.

384
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,959
Out! Out!

385
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:33,481
Quickly. quickly out!

386
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,567
There's danger of an explosion.

387
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,964
It's risky to stay here.

388
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,993
We have to...

389
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,929
We can't leave them there!
We've got to rescue them!

390
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,832
Ondrej is waiting!

391
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:02,398
The letter has left. I wrote that
the money would arrive.

392
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:10,032
I'll add the last salary and I'll send it.

393
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,523
I can't fool Eva.

394
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:26,130
Now you know why
I have to get out of here.

395
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,757
And why I have to live.

396
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:37,002
I don't want to die here like a rat!

397
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:44,442
Out! Even ifl have to dig
a thousand meters!

398
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,370
Out!

399
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,919
Let's pay tribute to those
who died there.

400
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:22,309
Rejoice, our Lord Jesus Christ
was born,

401
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:28,109
rejoice, a floret blossomed out
of a rose.

402
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:34,089
Lord Jesus Christ was born,

403
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:39,485
from a pure life,
from the royal dynasty.

404
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:53,476
Miéo. welcome home!

405
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,362
And Ondrej?

406
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,310
Alone?

407
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,594
Alone.

408
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,557
Were you there?

409
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,524
Iwas.

410
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:06,083
Did you close his eyes?

411
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:13,762
I can't believe he's dead.

412
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,043
Who are you?

413
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:03,797
What's your name?

414
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,638
He hasn't said a word yet.

415
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,327
He hasn't said a word yet.

416
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,769
- This way.
- Thank you.

417
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,523
How can I repay this?

418
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,514
We are human beings,
to help each other.

419
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:20,764
Wasn't Ondrej my best friend?

420
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:58,600
You shouldn't do it.
People will speak badly of us.

421
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,809
- We shouldn't care!
- And mother?

422
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,528
Mother?

423
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,805
She believes Ondrej will come back.

424
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:13,165
I'm alone, you're alone...

425
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:17,598
You'd better go!

426
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,630
MOBILIZATION ORDER

427
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:38,596
There's a war!

428
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:44,715
Boys are joining the army!

429
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:00,592
Before I leave, we'll get married.

430
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,526
If you don't have anything against it.

431
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,952
My child...

432
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,644
Ondrejko, dad has come back!

433
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:02,111
Hey boy, you have grown up!

434
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,725
Nice to see you!

435
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,450
Thank you.

436
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,046
How are you, mother?
Are you well?

437
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,406
Well, me?

438
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,928
Thank God we are all together again.

439
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,072
All?

440
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,089
I hope everything will be alright.

441
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,329
We'll finish the house,

442
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:40,808
you'll go to school and
we'll have a nice life.

443
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,405
And you, mom, you'll come with us.

444
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:50,317
I'll stay here, my daughter.

445
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:55,767
If Ondrej returns,

446
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,844
he would find an empty house.

447
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,602
I'm alive!

448
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,687
I'm alive!

449
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,406
Me, Ondrej Muranica!

450
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,640
Your results are good.

451
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:13,403
During the vacation you will see
how it goes in practice.

452
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,848
You'll be sent to measure wood
in the Black Valley.

453
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,911
Thank you.

454
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,358
Born in 1904...

455
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,356
- Your father?
- Allegedly died.

456
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:31,565
He went to America twelve years ago
and he hasn't come back yet.

457
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:41,450
Mountain don't feel sorrow for me...
mountain!

458
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:50,329
My darling doesn't call me anymore.

459
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,753
Married men will have a solo!

460
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:38,369
Son...

461
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,682
Mother!

462
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:16,879
Go have fun,
everything is well with me.

463
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:23,759
Ok. I'll go.

464
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:30,769
- But go to bed!
- Of course, I'll go.

465
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,475
Then l'm going-

466
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,600
I won't stay late!

467
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,447
Is Ondrej here?

468
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:32,389
It also seemed to me as if
he had returned.

469
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:38,169
Mom, why do you call him,
if you know he's dead?

470
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,965
You know very well he can't come.

471
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,316
Mom...

472
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:13,486
Well, you won't get angry anymore.

473
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:19,810
Did I offend somebody?

474
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:28,366
I stayed alone with the child,

475
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:34,921
Miéo came and helped me.

476
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:39,928
He treated Ondrejko well.

477
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,200
Forgive me, Mom?

478
01:28:52,200 --> 01:29:00,290
I'll pray for you and for
Ondrejko's soul.

479
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:06,630
Mom...

480
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,352
Iwish I hadn't come back.

481
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:13,039
You had to come back
just as you had to go.

482
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:17,210
They were bad times.

483
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:21,080
Now it's better for us.

484
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:24,949
We can live our own life.

485
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:31,085
Our own?

486
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,727
Me?

487
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:39,688
For who?

488
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,401
Look, what was left to me.

489
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,752
You've got your hands

490
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:50,510
and your son.

491
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,566
Go after him and tell him:

492
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:58,076
my son, you are the continuation
of my life.

493
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:01,471
All my hope, health and
power is within you.

494
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,837
Everything that the world has taken
from me is in you.

495
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:10,040
Love your land and don't betray it,
because you'll be lost.

496
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:15,650
Tell that to everybody,
warn them with these words.

497
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:08,163
THE END
