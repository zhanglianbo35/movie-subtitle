00:00:03,442 --> 00:00:07,215
THE END OF OLD TIMES

2
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:10,363
Whenever a hog puts on a duke's
underpants, it always busts through.

3
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,773
<i>My name is Bernard Spera.</i>

4
00:01:53,392 --> 00:01:56,861
<i>I used to be a librarian
in the Kratochville castle.</i>

5
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:00,014
<i>It lost its owner
in the 1918 revolution.</i>

6
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:06,116
<i>My Lord, Duke Prokovsky, fled
to the Tyrol when Indpendence came.</i>

7
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:12,443
<i>Everyone was ready
to take over the castle.</i>

8
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:16,703
<i>The result was a lot of squabbling
and damage to the property.</i>

9
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,419
<i>The National Assembly
had to appoint a regent.</i>

10
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:24,309
<i>Mr. Josef Stoklasa got the job.</i>

11
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:28,396
<i>He wasn't a nobleman.</i>

12
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,099
<i>He was loaded with money.</i>

13
00:02:31,606 --> 00:02:34,518
<i>He didn't know how to address
servants properly.</i>

14
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:47,983
<i>He was a widower with two daughters:
Michaela and Kitty.</i>

15
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:50,553
<i>And two governesses...</i>

16
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:53,150
Today's mail.

17
00:02:57,128 --> 00:03:02,460
<i>Ellen was a teacher
of uncertain age and sex.</i>

18
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,582
<i>For a French tutor,
he engaged the Parisienne Susanne</i>

19
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,331
<i>Since Josef Stoklasa was wealthy,</i>

20
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,030
<i>he wanted to buy the whole estate.</i>

21
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:51,737
<i>But the laws of the new republic
didn't permit it.</i>

22
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:55,593
<i>This led to all kinds of hassles.</i>

23
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:00,563
<i>He engaged Mr. Yakub Lhota,</i>

24
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:04,438
<i>leader of the wealthy Agrarian Party,
to secure the sympathy</i>

25
00:04:05,524 --> 00:04:07,300
<i>of influential people.</i>

26
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:10,004
<i>On the other side, he engaged</i>

27
00:04:10,232 --> 00:04:12,026
<i>the lawyer Mr. Pustina,</i>

28
00:04:12,214 --> 00:04:15,628
<i>who was the head of the peasants
wing in the same Party.</i>

29
00:04:21,253 --> 00:04:25,005
We're working hard
and gaining ground.

30
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,430
The peasants are the backbone
of the state.

31
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:31,982
In other words, the big landowners

32
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:33,870
are enemies of the State?

33
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:38,006
Give people a bit of land,
not too much, not too little...

34
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:44,749
You'll avoid the sweetness of
humanitarianism and the inclination

35
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:47,630
toward the negative ideals
of socialism.

36
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:51,190
You're an advocate
of a reactionary economy.

37
00:04:53,078 --> 00:04:55,265
I'm defending the peasant's interests.

38
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,421
I thought you were defending
Stoklasa's.

39
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:00,632
True! Through theirs,
I'm defending his.

40
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:04,359
Interesting. You sound like
a lawyer, Mr. Pustina.

41
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:11,400
<i>In the end, it was decided to revive
old customs and hold a banquet,</i>

42
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:14,719
<i>a banquet as splendid</i>

43
00:05:14,974 --> 00:05:17,485
<i>as any ever seen before.</i>

44
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:20,278
Bay leaf, cloves, thyme...

45
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:25,139
And don't forget the anise!

46
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:29,005
<i>It was also decided to call
a hunt so elaborate</i>

47
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:32,580
<i>that nothing could match it.</i>

48
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,673
Got it.

49
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,978
I'll oil the saddles,
clean the stirrups...

50
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:41,396
the bridles, prepare the guns,

51
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:46,165
rifles, chains for the partridges,
hunting knives for the deer...

52
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:51,415
<i>A hunt is a wonderful pretext
for a feast,</i>

53
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:53,155
<i>the feast a pretext for splendor,</i>

54
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:56,244
<i>and the splendor of the feast
an opportunity</i>

55
00:05:56,684 --> 00:05:58,871
<i>to silence the slanderers</i>

56
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:14,776
You played beautifully.

57
00:06:36,642 --> 00:06:40,726
<i>To add to the glitter
they invited Count Alfred Koda,</i>

58
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,517
<i>the most illustrious
of our neighbors.</i>

59
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,916
<i>They prepared the best
guest room for him.</i>

60
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:54,846
<i>I was asked to invite him
to the hunt and the banquet.</i>

61
00:06:55,913 --> 00:06:58,633
<i>But the Count was
an arrogant devil.</i>

62
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:03,310
<i>It was beneath him to talk
to commoners.</i>

63
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,644
<i>And so my mission failed.</i>

64
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,440
<i>However, I didn't have the courage
to tell my master.</i>

65
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:22,084
<i>Knowing how it would disturb him,</i>

66
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:24,359
<i>I was afraid of his reaction.</i>

67
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:33,429
- Has Count Koda arrived yet?
- Not yet.

68
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:50,591
- Has Count Koda arrived yet?
- Not yet, sir.

69
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,691
A true aristocrat
always arrives last.

70
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:00,737
- Welcome, my dear friend!
- Greetings, everyone!

71
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:05,949
- Has Count Koda arrived yet?
- Count Koda?

72
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:10,226
- Maybe he's on his way.
- What do you mean, "maybe"?

73
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,578
He hasn't been seen in society
for several years.

74
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,303
- He's an odd man.
- Odd, but an aristocrat.

75
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:20,959
My son, Jan.

76
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:25,599
My daughter.

77
00:08:48,573 --> 00:08:50,135
Marvelous!

78
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:59,144
Even the last Duke couldn't
manage a hunt like this!

79
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:03,651
That will shut them all up.
Pardon.

80
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:09,294
Michaela, you are charm itself.

81
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:17,841
I'm going to change.

82
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,551
If Count Koda arrives,
tell him to catch up with us.

83
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:50,941
I told you that a nobleman
always arrives last.

84
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:18,961
<i>But the Devil never sleeps.</i>

85
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:23,033
<i>A few yards before the finish
we broke a wheel.</i>

86
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:27,327
<i>This set off a series of
extraordinary events</i>

87
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,077
<i>which eventually put an end
to my peaceful life.</i>

88
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:33,217
<i>and irreversibly changed
the mansion.</i>

89
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:43,265
Get out of the way!

90
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:09,698
Wait!

91
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,770
Leave me alone!

92
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:26,068
Aren't you Count Koda?

93
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:33,394
The Count!

94
00:14:33,736 --> 00:14:36,855
Count Koda has arrived!

95
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:40,939
I'm Prince Alexei.
My servant Vanya.

96
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:48,963
Your Highness, please.

97
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:24,612
- That's no count!
- Count or prince...

98
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:28,840
All nobles are the same.
You can't tell them apart.

99
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,427
Champagne!

100
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:34,204
And where is the caviar?

101
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:20,306
Lecherous old man!

102
00:16:21,382 --> 00:16:23,762
What are you gaping at?

103
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,037
Where have we met before?

104
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:38,439
Weren't you Mr. de Monfre's
secretary?

105
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:45,867
- Not I...
- You dust the books in the library,

106
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,317
Your kidneys are shot,
and you're not worth a cent.

107
00:16:51,283 --> 00:16:53,285
True, I'm a librarian.

108
00:16:53,686 --> 00:16:57,912
- As for my internal organs...
- We'll see when you start drinking.

109
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,683
Let us eat and drink!
Taste the food,

110
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:28,287
rich cheese, game meat, chicken,
all that's born alive

111
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,367
or hatched from eggs.

112
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,715
all that ripens in the sun,

113
00:18:33,922 --> 00:18:35,505
all that has fins,

114
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:39,127
snails which are eaten
in civilized countries.

115
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,904
To read and sleep,
to drink wine extravagantly -

116
00:18:57,108 --> 00:18:59,386
there's nothing wrong with that.

117
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:02,489
It all depends on who's doing it.

118
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:07,103
A slob lets the best book
fall out of his hands.

119
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,783
He'd turn the best bed
into a pigsty.

120
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,698
The finest wine will become
bitter on his tongue.

121
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,985
All he gets from it is
a terrible headache.

122
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:19,766
Such a slob should just go to hell.

123
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:23,764
He shouldn't pretend
to passion or love,

124
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:25,835
or that he works when he's idle,

125
00:19:26,004 --> 00:19:29,293
that he's in love
when he thinks about himself.

126
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:31,161
You're electric!

127
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,040
May I read your fortune?

128
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:37,161
You're fortune's child.
Men will fight over you.

129
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,194
- One, two, whole armies of men!
- What else?

130
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:43,034
The man of your dreams,

131
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:45,929
from a good family,
will come running for you.

132
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:48,860
- Who's that fellow?
- An acquaintance of Lhota.

133
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:52,125
Is that the company
that Lhota keeps?

134
00:19:57,814 --> 00:19:59,584
Who is that fellow?

135
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,238
An acquaintance of Stoklasa.

136
00:20:06,576 --> 00:20:08,125
I can see...

137
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:12,340
a well-educated man,
well-read, near you.

138
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:19,019
You don't know this yet, but his soul
is pure and waits to merge with yours.

139
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:26,116
- You're French, then?
- Yes

140
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:29,999
What keeps you here is the faint
hope that something extraordinary

141
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:32,780
will happen to stir
your proud heart.

142
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,754
- Proud?
- And he'll make it beat.

143
00:20:35,977 --> 00:20:40,674
A miracle awaits you...
in the form of a man

144
00:20:42,498 --> 00:20:45,327
He's loving and wealthy,

145
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,290
and his plain looks conceal
a fiery heart.

146
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,750
- Fiery?
- Cache un coeur ardent...

147
00:20:54,024 --> 00:20:56,415
Cache un coeur ardent...

148
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,372
Your friend is a great entertainer.

149
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:23,771
- My friend?
- You're kidding. Jakub, he's your guest

150
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:25,953
Mine? No!

151
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:31,047
Kotera, who is it?

152
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,487
The man you've been expecting
for so long.

153
00:21:36,636 --> 00:21:37,948
Please, no gentlemen!

154
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,803
Telling the fortune of gentlemen
is usually boring.

155
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,446
May I have your hand, Madame?

156
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,623
Sir...

157
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:55,580
I'd like to show you
the best shot...

158
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,755
- Yes...
- ...that I've ever seen.

159
00:22:01,426 --> 00:22:02,675
Got it.

160
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:09,780
Ladies!

161
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,825
Come and have a look!

162
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,867
Indeed, a divine shot!
Who took it?

163
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:31,008
I did.

164
00:22:31,468 --> 00:22:34,304
Are you so blind that you can't tell
a female from a male?

165
00:22:34,748 --> 00:22:38,042
It was part of the plan.
The deer are overbreeding...

166
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:41,394
- But she was pregnant!
- Sir, who are you?

167
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:43,637
We're discussing the deer now!

168
00:22:44,225 --> 00:22:47,123
When I was in Lipno,
a fellow shot a pregnant doe.

169
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,209
You know what happened?
Count Porazhki sprayed him with pellets.

170
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:51,851
His rear end was riddled.

171
00:22:51,943 --> 00:22:55,560
And you're making excuses!
What's your job?

172
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,987
How did you come by the gun?

173
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:04,162
Idiot, pretending you love hunting!
Why go to the forest?

174
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:07,333
You pen-pusher,
afraid of everything!

175
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:10,718
- Out, you peasant!
- What do you believe in?

176
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,406
You're a man without adventures
and without imagination.

177
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:20,631
You're just concerned with filling
your purse and belly.

178
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,883
Sir...

179
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:26,493
The lawyer, with whom you've had
such a sharp exchange,

180
00:23:26,728 --> 00:23:28,238
is my friend.

181
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:32,545
Maybe you should put
the matter to an end.

182
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:34,689
This man is a fraud!

183
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,787
I'm Prince Alexander Megalrogov,
Colonel to Nicholas II.

184
00:23:38,932 --> 00:23:41,381
Thank you for your pleasant company.

185
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:48,280
What a pity!

186
00:23:49,414 --> 00:23:50,570
Why did he leave?

187
00:23:51,157 --> 00:23:53,114
That was a great show!

188
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,145
Sir!

189
00:24:02,894 --> 00:24:05,091
Not even my former Duke

190
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,278
gave me such a generous tip!

191
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:09,455
- He is a Prince...
- I knew that from the start!

192
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,159
Aristocrat...

193
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:15,856
Daddy, call His Highness back,
please!

194
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:26,445
- Your Highness!
- Mr. Colonel!

195
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:33,078
- Where are you?
- Your Grace!

196
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,967
Your Prince was magnificent!
I'm enchanted!

197
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:50,133
Congratulations on your Prince!
A noble joke.

198
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:35,966
- I love you.
- Not now...

199
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:37,884
Michaela !

200
00:25:38,756 --> 00:25:41,479
Let me go...!
We have to go back.

201
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:20,682
The Prince is here!

202
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:23,004
Your Highness!

203
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:42,767
Eat and drink as much
as you like.

204
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:45,697
Enjoy yourself!

205
00:26:45,915 --> 00:26:50,520
Allow yourself everything,
for this time of plenty

206
00:26:50,897 --> 00:26:53,699
will give way to one of hardship.

207
00:26:58,103 --> 00:26:59,974
Gorge on pâté,

208
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:03,614
and when you are offered
a plate of cookies, eat them all.

209
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:07,806
Do everything you can now,
my friend.

210
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:12,358
because lean times
are not far away.

211
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:16,635
As for women, Vanya, be prudent.

212
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:21,831
But if you come across a lusty wench,
feel free to indulge!

213
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:42,255
I see I'm in distinguished company.
Good morning!

214
00:29:36,764 --> 00:29:38,078
Cornelia !

215
00:29:41,611 --> 00:29:44,173
You only want to take, Bernard!

216
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,129
Tonight, Cornelia, tonight!

217
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,766
Again!

218
00:29:58,954 --> 00:30:00,360
Catch!

219
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,797
- Pardon.
- Sir, you should be ashamed!

220
00:30:05,947 --> 00:30:08,264
Court etiquette demands

221
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:11,654
demands exercise on a horse
or bannister.

222
00:30:11,865 --> 00:30:15,649
Both firm up the posterior.

223
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,941
You cheat!

224
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:36,697
Your Highness, go to the courtyard
or the fields!

225
00:30:36,826 --> 00:30:38,388
Rubbish, Bernard!

226
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:42,518
This is a wonderfully flat floor.

227
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:45,716
Children!

228
00:30:46,516 --> 00:30:48,416
Go play the piano!

229
00:31:25,122 --> 00:31:26,634
Pardon.

230
00:31:58,656 --> 00:32:00,144
What are you gaping at?

231
00:32:00,598 --> 00:32:04,084
Haven't you got anything to do?
Get plucking!

232
00:32:37,237 --> 00:32:41,362
Why waste your time? Why feed him?
What are you expecting?

233
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,316
He's a fortune hunter,
he'll make a fool of you.

234
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:46,927
Yes, the Prince is a cheerful fellow.

235
00:32:47,087 --> 00:32:53,892
People like your Prince
are only after free food and drink!

236
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,673
- But he's a Prince.
- A crackpot!

237
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:00,462
He brightens Kratochville and
helps my intentions.

238
00:33:00,787 --> 00:33:01,889
Helps?

239
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,416
If he makes us look ridiculous
in the eyes of decent folk

240
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:09,640
and we're thought of as reactionaries,

241
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:14,256
it will only happen because of
your propensity for

242
00:33:15,088 --> 00:33:16,785
such people!

243
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:18,886
Summon him.

244
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:30,652
I invited you, Colonel...

245
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:34,813
- To... finally...
- I understand.

246
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:38,386
I understand, you need advice.

247
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:42,055
Your Kratochville estate
is magnificent, sir.

248
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:45,184
It only lacks a riding school
and kennels.

249
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:47,385
- Don't you realize
it's not mine yet?

250
00:33:47,655 --> 00:33:50,241
Nowadays renting would be better
than owning.

251
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:55,093
Lhota and the lawyer keep
promising but nothing happens...

252
00:33:56,874 --> 00:33:58,576
Back to the point!

253
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:01,654
Build a large riding school

254
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:06,584
according to the plans that
I shall deliver tomorrow.

255
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:07,709
Sir...

256
00:34:08,597 --> 00:34:10,901
- What is it, Kotera?
- Visiting cards.

257
00:34:11,941 --> 00:34:15,219
All the local gentlemen
are inviting our Prince.

258
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:20,301
You see, they all envy us,
Your Grace!

259
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:28,919
I remain faithful to my host.

260
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:15,955
How come Your Highness speaks
Czech so well?

261
00:35:20,538 --> 00:35:24,291
Thank you for not recognizing
my accent. How flattering!

262
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:27,155
My mother comes from this region.

263
00:35:27,443 --> 00:35:28,510
Is she of noble birth?

264
00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:32,785
Could you tell us her
distinguished name?

265
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:35,165
Perchta Rosenberg.

266
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,252
My father was General Megalrogov,
Prince of Kiev.

267
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:40,963
I don't know any Perchta
around here.

268
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:45,059
Doctor, you'd do better to attend to
what I hired you for.

269
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:49,043
But I don't want anyone to make
a fool of you.

270
00:35:51,093 --> 00:35:53,624
Spera - what do the books say?

271
00:35:57,626 --> 00:36:01,667
The Rosenberg Chronicle
mentions a lady Perchta...

272
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:04,739
Nonsense! There's no Perchta.

273
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:17,266
I won't allow anyone to besmirch
my mother's name.

274
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:26,539
What are you doing?

275
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:29,930
A minute's silence
for her heavenly soul...

276
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:43,871
Perchta was the White Lady!

277
00:37:44,071 --> 00:37:46,121
Would you prefer her in black?

278
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:48,996
She lived 300 years ago!

279
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,740
So...

280
00:37:52,296 --> 00:37:57,101
If she was a hundred when you were born,
Your Highness,

281
00:37:57,474 --> 00:37:59,666
you'd be at least 200 years
old now.

282
00:37:59,926 --> 00:38:01,314
So what?

283
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:06,387
Do you know how old I really am?

284
00:39:25,087 --> 00:39:27,307
- La nature.
- La nature.

285
00:39:28,305 --> 00:39:29,799
La nature.

286
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:33,802
En automne, se change.

287
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,363
- se change...
- se change...

288
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,795
Elle s'habille

289
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,745
A year ago I nearly got what I wanted.
And now what?

290
00:40:01,994 --> 00:40:04,251
Surveyor after surveyor,
commission after commission,

291
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,088
ministries, property registers...

292
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,878
It's that smart lawyer of yours

293
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12,887
God knows
who'll finally get the mansion.

294
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:17,529
The way things are,
you won't get it anyway.

295
00:40:18,106 --> 00:40:19,244
What?

296
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:21,103
Why won't I get it?

297
00:40:21,345 --> 00:40:24,143
I don't want it for free.
I want to buy it.

298
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:27,775
Have you made an offer yet?

299
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:30,378
- No.
- Just as well.

300
00:40:30,872 --> 00:40:34,120
Please, don't show them
that you're rich.

301
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:38,384
Today we have to do three things:

302
00:40:38,874 --> 00:40:40,840
wear worn-out shoes,

303
00:40:41,582 --> 00:40:45,068
eat sausages, and talk yourself up.

304
00:40:45,587 --> 00:40:49,037
Eventually we'll come out fine.

305
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:52,561
Don't make waves around here.

306
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:57,188
Couldn't you get Charousek
on your side?

307
00:40:57,361 --> 00:40:59,284
Charousek? Who's he?

308
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:03,201
He's... a good fellow.

309
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:07,684
The Vice President's
of the peasant's wing

310
00:41:15,754 --> 00:41:18,788
Hey! Who'se stealing our wood?

311
00:41:20,257 --> 00:41:24,032
- That's the peasant Charousek.
- So, a peasant!

312
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,798
I knew he couldn't be a pauper!

313
00:41:27,993 --> 00:41:32,674
He's taking good wood,
not just kindling.

314
00:41:45,488 --> 00:41:47,246
What do you want, scarecrow?

315
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:50,936
You're trespassing.
Get out of here!

316
00:41:51,156 --> 00:41:55,170
- Let me be, scarecrow!
- I'll "scarecrow" you!

317
00:41:55,731 --> 00:41:58,085
You yokel!
You loafer!

318
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,885
I'll "scarecrow" you!

319
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:04,944
You... you...
you'll pay for this!

320
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,500
With pleasure!

321
00:42:08,284 --> 00:42:10,273
I'll "scarecrow" you!"

322
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:59,572
Of course we'll still have
our hands full.

323
00:43:01,154 --> 00:43:03,982
The only way to get the estate

324
00:43:04,924 --> 00:43:06,544
is to start a cooperative.

325
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:10,254
What kind of cooperative?
Who'll be in it?

326
00:43:10,733 --> 00:43:15,464
You, me, your daughter,
my son,

327
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,461
Charousek, and a few other
decent people.

328
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:26,222
- Michaela and Jan?
- Are you blind, my friend?

329
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:30,018
All that's left is to agree
on the wedding date.

330
00:43:37,059 --> 00:43:39,129
What a farce!

331
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:41,731
I've hardly seen the bride
and they've got us married.

332
00:43:41,957 --> 00:43:43,020
Jan!

333
00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:17,449
What's he saying?

334
00:44:17,575 --> 00:44:19,645
That the blue is prettier...

335
00:44:20,552 --> 00:44:21,934
than the pink.

336
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:33,127
Mate!

337
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,697
Cornelia...

338
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:37,580
tonight!

339
00:46:52,061 --> 00:46:55,842
Eduard Fuchs
MORAL PRACTICE- Illustrated Edition

340
00:47:07,989 --> 00:47:13,916
<i>Two people in amorous silence</i>

341
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:22,331
<i>Never think of parting...</i>

342
00:47:28,825 --> 00:47:32,113
<i>Having said my morning
prayers as usual...</i>

343
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,758
- What are you writing, Your Highness?
- The regimental journal.

344
00:47:36,582 --> 00:47:41,459
<i>Nothing will divert me from
my military duty.</i>

345
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,653
Mr. Lhota's arrived!

346
00:48:08,866 --> 00:48:12,919
Come on girls, it's a nice day!
I brought Jan along.

347
00:48:15,238 --> 00:48:17,105
He'll take you out.

348
00:48:27,493 --> 00:48:28,955
Good day.

349
00:48:39,245 --> 00:48:42,146
That's good.
Let's go.

350
00:49:39,162 --> 00:49:41,448
You greedy bastard!

351
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:45,611
Aren't all your cronies enough?

352
00:49:46,145 --> 00:49:48,541
Why bring in a spy?

353
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:53,001
Kindling's worthless.
We've taken wood since the Duke's time.

354
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,899
And no one asked a question!

355
00:49:56,303 --> 00:49:58,822
Now, that we have a Republic,

356
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:02,349
that servant of yours breaks
my barrow and takes my axe.

357
00:50:02,659 --> 00:50:04,547
I'll show you at your meeting!

358
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:09,114
Just wait and see if you can
get Kratochville!

359
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:11,643
Are you crazy?
Who are you?

360
00:50:12,432 --> 00:50:13,900
Charousek!

361
00:50:14,605 --> 00:50:16,535
Charousek! Charousek!

362
00:50:17,077 --> 00:50:18,863
He's your friend, sir.

363
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,259
You're being too hard
on his petty thievery.

364
00:50:24,865 --> 00:50:30,081
I don't mean you,
But that scarecrow, Prince Alexei.

365
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,526
Don't be frightened!

366
00:51:12,553 --> 00:51:16,524
I tell you again,
send that deserter to the devil.

367
00:51:16,877 --> 00:51:20,516
Then I might be able to pacify
our Vice-President.

368
00:51:20,883 --> 00:51:21,774
What?

369
00:51:22,016 --> 00:51:24,555
Is Mr. Charousek
the Vice-President of your Party?

370
00:51:24,767 --> 00:51:27,691
Yes, and your Prince beat him up.

371
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:32,112
I told you not to overdo it.

372
00:51:32,403 --> 00:51:35,073
But you listen only to Mr. Jakub Lhota.

373
00:51:35,777 --> 00:51:39,725
Lhota's interests are different
from yours.

374
00:51:39,893 --> 00:51:43,808
You're wrong. He has influence,
but he's my old friend.

375
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:44,996
Friend?

376
00:51:45,134 --> 00:51:47,687
Can't you see?
He's planted his dandy son on you

377
00:51:47,996 --> 00:51:53,534
to get Michaela
and Kratochville in one move.

378
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:57,463
Charousek'll do what
I ask him to do.

379
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,447
His outburst was a warning

380
00:52:00,707 --> 00:52:04,332
not to stray too far from
your allies.

381
00:52:05,054 --> 00:52:07,901
Jakub Lhota's influence has been
worrying us.

382
00:52:50,278 --> 00:52:52,262
Did I offend you?

383
00:52:52,898 --> 00:52:56,092
I won't be a pawn in our
fathers' game.

384
00:52:57,976 --> 00:52:59,820
I don't know what you mean...

385
00:53:00,942 --> 00:53:04,453
You're playing along
with your father.

386
00:53:05,191 --> 00:53:08,468
He wants to evade the law
with a wedding.

387
00:53:08,756 --> 00:53:13,140
If my father's involved,
I just won't go along.

388
00:53:28,796 --> 00:53:30,039
Stop!

389
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:41,598
Want to go for a walk?

390
00:53:43,584 --> 00:53:45,493
Let's take a walk in the forest.

391
00:53:47,571 --> 00:53:48,822
Go!

392
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,991
Home! Go home!

393
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:08,683
At your service!

394
00:54:32,422 --> 00:54:33,955
Get out of the way!

395
00:54:35,607 --> 00:54:37,001
Let's go!

396
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,022
Watch out!

397
00:54:44,226 --> 00:54:46,417
The aristocracy are coming!

398
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:04,097
- Do you speak French?
- Yes.

399
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:12,973
Thank you,
your French is charming.

400
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,210
I told Charousek that you and
that scarecrow Prince

401
00:55:30,605 --> 00:55:33,431
had nothing in common.
And so...

402
00:55:34,295 --> 00:55:39,356
And so I forgive you for the damage
done to my body and goods.

403
00:55:40,745 --> 00:55:43,918
I apologize again, Stoklasa.

404
00:55:47,693 --> 00:55:51,392
You can count on me where
Kratochville is concerned.

405
00:55:51,909 --> 00:55:55,231
Mr. Lhota was right -
you're kindness itself.

406
00:55:55,434 --> 00:55:58,800
There's one condition:
I demand an apology.

407
00:55:59,774 --> 00:56:02,967
I can still feel the beating
he gave me.

408
00:56:03,521 --> 00:56:05,108
We'll see to that.

409
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:22,385
You're friend's a big mouth
and a cheat.

410
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,324
I love Michaela.

411
00:56:29,631 --> 00:56:31,429
I'd do anything for her.

412
00:56:31,586 --> 00:56:35,271
Give me her hand and I'll get
Kratochville for you.

413
00:56:44,212 --> 00:56:47,328
- If she consents, you...
- My car!

414
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,679
My automobile!

415
00:58:51,501 --> 00:58:54,851
The Prince is the best
horse driver I've seen.

416
00:58:57,018 --> 00:58:59,763
You've handled horses a lot,
haven't you?

417
00:59:00,715 --> 00:59:03,891
True, there were dozens
of them on our estate.

418
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:08,464
Judging by your behavior,
you also groomed them.

419
00:59:10,415 --> 00:59:13,956
Sir, if you wan't an argument,
this won't do it.

420
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:19,134
Find another pretext
less conceited and less transparent.

421
00:59:19,403 --> 00:59:22,730
Don't act like a lover wanting
to punish a lady

422
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:26,429
who doesn't give a damn
about him.

423
00:59:26,918 --> 00:59:29,440
Don't drag her into our fight

424
00:59:29,703 --> 00:59:32,287
just because you tighten your hat...

425
00:59:33,314 --> 00:59:36,588
and your face reminds me
of a wooden toy.

426
00:59:40,004 --> 00:59:43,496
Jan can't help being involved
with the young lady.

427
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:50,617
Excuse me, but I don't
need your help.

428
01:00:06,989 --> 01:00:09,147
You seem to have all the luck.

429
01:00:09,761 --> 01:00:12,919
Nothing like the luck of a captain
I knew.

430
01:00:15,563 --> 01:00:16,912
That man

431
01:00:17,175 --> 01:00:19,205
had a dog so clever

432
01:00:19,414 --> 01:00:22,763
that it seemed almost human.

433
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:28,572
Our captain never knew
when to end a game.

434
01:00:29,116 --> 01:00:31,506
He would sit at the table,

435
01:00:31,863 --> 01:00:35,753
determined to win at any cost,

436
01:00:36,202 --> 01:00:39,654
and when he had a decent pile
in front of him,

437
01:00:40,669 --> 01:00:43,865
he staked everything on that
one card.

438
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:48,227
The dog got out from under the table,

439
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:52,949
stared at his hand after he waved

440
01:00:53,325 --> 01:00:57,640
until he pocketed the money.

441
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:01,204
The captain felt obliged
to keep playing

442
01:01:01,776 --> 01:01:05,289
But the dog, whose name was Stella,

443
01:01:05,816 --> 01:01:09,886
went for him viciously,

444
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:12,906
and he had to defend himself
with his cane.

445
01:01:13,478 --> 01:01:16,178
They all tried in vain to chase it

446
01:01:16,358 --> 01:01:19,083
Only killing it would make it stop.

447
01:01:19,251 --> 01:01:22,607
But the captain wouldn't hear of it.

448
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:23,892
Pass.

449
01:01:25,142 --> 01:01:29,136
So he had to do what
the dog wanted and leave.

450
01:01:29,397 --> 01:01:32,607
- Pass.
- I must leave.

451
01:01:34,088 --> 01:01:36,320
Thank you for the game, gentlemen.

452
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:52,192
The cheat thinks it's as easy
as that.

453
01:02:59,677 --> 01:03:02,236
First he turns us on,
then he ignores us.

454
01:03:02,419 --> 01:03:04,148
Don't touch me!

455
01:03:11,222 --> 01:03:14,909
You Judas,
you've exceeded all limits!

456
01:03:15,544 --> 01:03:19,601
Spera dear, since when
have we been on familiar terms?

457
01:03:19,781 --> 01:03:21,101
Have a drink!

458
01:03:22,339 --> 01:03:25,361
Isn't Cornelia enough for you?
You need Susanne as well?

459
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:29,043
You're in your fifties,
you should be ashamed!

460
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:30,809
45.

461
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,105
Let's say it outright.

462
01:03:33,357 --> 01:03:35,843
You sponge on other people.

463
01:03:36,074 --> 01:03:38,569
You play with other people's girls.

464
01:03:39,257 --> 01:03:43,441
Bernard Spera,
calm down and have a drink.

465
01:03:44,061 --> 01:03:46,738
I don't owe Stoklasa anything.

466
01:03:46,905 --> 01:03:50,309
He's only an innkeeper,
he deals with tables and bedding.

467
01:03:50,734 --> 01:03:55,156
But after what you've said,
I have to leave.

468
01:03:56,497 --> 01:03:58,517
Vanya, pack up!

469
01:04:24,706 --> 01:04:27,871
French women have beautiful skin, eh?

470
01:04:28,651 --> 01:04:29,761
I hate you!

471
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:31,733
I don't return it,

472
01:04:31,857 --> 01:04:34,303
but I"m still obliged
to slap your face.

473
01:04:34,388 --> 01:04:35,619
Vanya, turn around!

474
01:04:45,438 --> 01:04:49,532
You've no grounds to say I'm on
the side of your enemies.

475
01:04:54,512 --> 01:04:58,074
<i>I deserved a different treatment
from what I received.</i>

476
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:01,507
<i>You'll wish you hadn't
humiliated me.</i>

477
01:05:01,907 --> 01:05:05,097
<i>I'll fight you with your own weapons,
believe me.</i>

478
01:05:05,379 --> 01:05:08,125
<i>I intend to make things hot for you.</i>

479
01:05:12,477 --> 01:05:17,696
The Prince acts as if there were
two regents here at Kratochville.

480
01:05:19,807 --> 01:05:22,641
He's an intriguer and a coward.

481
01:05:22,846 --> 01:05:28,640
I called him a scoundrel and slapped
his face, but he didn't return it.

482
01:05:31,068 --> 01:05:33,637
Really?
The Prince didn't defend himself?

483
01:05:33,774 --> 01:05:38,204
Let's come together and
give him what he deserves.

484
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:42,736
Do you have something personal
against him?

485
01:05:44,585 --> 01:05:49,939
Our only concern has to be
to protect Stoklasa's name.

486
01:05:50,618 --> 01:05:53,049
I'm also concerned with honor.

487
01:05:58,578 --> 01:06:02,210
We need to send the Prince off
with his tail between his legs.

488
01:06:06,574 --> 01:06:09,808
To the side...
to the side...

489
01:06:10,108 --> 01:06:13,147
Lunge... parry... lunge...

490
01:06:13,495 --> 01:06:14,989
Excellent, mademoiselle...

491
01:06:16,082 --> 01:06:19,675
- How do you hold the sabre?
- So as to wound!

492
01:06:20,096 --> 01:06:22,338
I know many fencing schools,

493
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:25,236
and I see that you prefer
the Oriental school,

494
01:06:25,411 --> 01:06:28,370
which permits all kinds of tricks
and vague rules.

495
01:06:28,643 --> 01:06:31,760
We stress graceful
and elegant movements.

496
01:06:32,983 --> 01:06:37,365
I could easily knock the weapon from
your hand and hit any spot you name.

497
01:06:37,579 --> 01:06:40,943
It's fortunate you have
no reason to attack.

498
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:43,662
Your Highness, don't let them
interrupt us.

499
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,721
They obviously had a bad night.

500
01:06:48,408 --> 01:06:50,025
Excellent!

501
01:06:50,994 --> 01:06:52,447
I surrender!

502
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,180
Your Highness,
Mr. Charousek's arrived.

503
01:06:57,555 --> 01:07:00,336
He's an arrogant chap but
I need him.

504
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:03,500
- I don't want any regional squabbles.
- I see.

505
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,462
Well...

506
01:07:19,571 --> 01:07:22,079
Plague on you!
Put that down!

507
01:07:23,566 --> 01:07:25,143
Apologize.

508
01:07:26,551 --> 01:07:27,858
What for?

509
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:31,395
For that wood you stole?

510
01:07:33,559 --> 01:07:35,499
That's ridiculous!
Stole!

511
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,452
Stealing in a forest
that's practically mine anway?

512
01:07:39,759 --> 01:07:42,423
Practically yours...

513
01:07:43,425 --> 01:07:45,040
Aren't you ashamed?

514
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:50,938
Did you really think that
you'd take over the castle?

515
01:07:51,173 --> 01:07:55,176
That you'd sit with the nobility?

516
01:07:55,442 --> 01:07:56,846
You're deluded.

517
01:07:56,989 --> 01:08:00,828
What would you say if I asked
for half your land?

518
01:08:01,104 --> 01:08:07,064
You're a lout who only pursues
his own interests!

519
01:08:07,654 --> 01:08:10,434
Do you think Mr. Stoklasa's
that stupid?

520
01:08:12,249 --> 01:08:14,008
You've had your fill!

521
01:08:14,107 --> 01:08:15,036
- Mr. Stoklasa...

522
01:08:15,122 --> 01:08:19,395
- When all this is finished
and the property is ours,

523
01:08:20,936 --> 01:08:25,644
you'll be sent packing
with a swollen lip!

524
01:08:29,729 --> 01:08:32,101
What an idiot I am!

525
01:08:33,516 --> 01:08:37,765
Instead of taking care of the cows,
I go to castle to be insulted!

526
01:08:39,045 --> 01:08:41,677
Never put your trust in Princes!

527
01:08:46,628 --> 01:08:48,144
Get stuffed!

528
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:53,036
Didn't I get it straight?

529
01:08:53,221 --> 01:08:55,108
Isn't that what you were thinking?

530
01:08:55,344 --> 01:08:57,882
What do you think?
I have my pride too!

531
01:08:58,063 --> 01:09:00,548
As long as you can dull your anger
on some young wench,

532
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:03,847
as long as poachers
make your blood boil,

533
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:06,255
the world will be a beautiful place,

534
01:09:06,418 --> 01:09:09,123
for it all happens
deep in the forest.

535
01:09:09,465 --> 01:09:13,050
What right do you have
to insult Mr. Stoklasa's friend?

536
01:09:13,877 --> 01:09:16,462
Mr. Pustina, I'd never allow

537
01:09:16,659 --> 01:09:21,447
anyone, whenever and wherever,
to deceive or steal from my host.

538
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:25,229
And I'd never call you "man"...

539
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:29,228
you're so far away from one,
you're not even from the same country.

540
01:09:30,419 --> 01:09:34,255
- He swindles at cards.
- I lost 900 crowns last night.

541
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,275
-  And I lost 300!

542
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:38,763
Which game do you have in mind?

543
01:09:39,157 --> 01:09:41,567
The one you won last night.

544
01:09:41,735 --> 01:09:44,786
Last night's winnings
are in the drawer.

545
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:52,560
Spera, open it.

546
01:10:01,509 --> 01:10:04,571
Good Lord, Your Highness!
What if someone stole it?

547
01:10:32,877 --> 01:10:35,659
Let me remind you of one
of your little games

548
01:10:36,251 --> 01:10:40,408
You said you were a good fencer.

549
01:10:40,915 --> 01:10:45,135
My friends and I want
to rid you of that illusion.

550
01:10:45,403 --> 01:10:48,140
- Are you challenging him to a duel?
- Are you going to fight?

551
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:49,975
Just a joke.

552
01:10:50,299 --> 01:10:54,171
If he wins, we are obliged
to believe everything he told us.

553
01:10:55,026 --> 01:10:58,104
I swear before the ladies,
Your Highness,

554
01:10:58,307 --> 01:11:01,608
we'll accept every word you said.

555
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:07,136
If you lose,
you accept our verdict.

556
01:11:08,696 --> 01:11:10,711
- Do you want me to?
- Yes

557
01:11:10,868 --> 01:11:13,860
Gentlemen, I accept your challenge.

558
01:11:16,337 --> 01:11:18,701
- What is it?
- A secret.

559
01:11:29,528 --> 01:11:33,590
First, listen to our conditions,
Your Highness.

560
01:11:33,737 --> 01:11:39,829
If you lose, we'll choose an
appropriate mask for you.

561
01:11:41,154 --> 01:11:42,591
Agreed.

562
01:11:42,857 --> 01:11:44,208
Let's start.

563
01:12:20,939 --> 01:12:22,524
Pardon.

564
01:12:44,711 --> 01:12:46,923
This is useless!

565
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:03,598
Once, there was a captain
who fought like this.

566
01:13:04,059 --> 01:13:06,478
You know what happened?

567
01:13:07,788 --> 01:13:09,390
He lost his hand!

568
01:13:10,046 --> 01:13:12,163
But he wasn't hit.

569
01:13:12,415 --> 01:13:18,718
It turned black...
from all that vigorous waving!

570
01:14:14,306 --> 01:14:15,829
Wait, Your Highness!

571
01:14:37,381 --> 01:14:42,524
We've brought you the insignia
that you lost a century ago.

572
01:14:42,758 --> 01:14:45,523
Baron Munchhausen's hat!

573
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:54,055
Listen, Michaela.

574
01:15:00,244 --> 01:15:01,932
I love you!

575
01:15:02,613 --> 01:15:04,964
I asked your father if
I could marry you.

576
01:15:05,096 --> 01:15:06,448
You're drunk!

577
01:15:06,948 --> 01:15:09,237
Your beauty makes me drunk.

578
01:15:09,465 --> 01:15:12,744
I've been fighting
for the mansion because of you.

579
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:19,947
Mr. Baron,

580
01:15:21,282 --> 01:15:25,321
what about matching
the hat with long johns?

581
01:15:34,921 --> 01:15:36,374
Why not?

582
01:17:13,074 --> 01:17:15,130
Scoundrels!

583
01:17:18,514 --> 01:17:21,847
Out of my kitchen!

584
01:17:22,828 --> 01:17:24,430
Scoundrels!

585
01:17:27,437 --> 01:17:33,122
Get out of here, the lot of you!

586
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,598
You've taught me a lesson.

587
01:17:49,792 --> 01:17:52,565
You're a good student
of the Flemish school.

588
01:17:52,802 --> 01:17:55,065
Another few lessons
and I'd be scared of you.

589
01:17:55,218 --> 01:17:57,751
I'll show you Flemish school
you bastards!

590
01:17:58,086 --> 01:17:59,750
I'll show you lessons!

591
01:17:59,889 --> 01:18:02,224
Get out, the lot of you!

592
01:18:02,543 --> 01:18:05,478
All of you!
I'll show you!

593
01:18:08,466 --> 01:18:10,257
You too!

594
01:18:12,805 --> 01:18:14,574
Clean it up.

595
01:18:17,512 --> 01:18:20,541
You should've known he was
a good fencer.

596
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:25,236
You've made a mistake.

597
01:18:26,226 --> 01:18:28,294
You'll have to apologize
to the Prince.

598
01:18:29,013 --> 01:18:33,458
Well, if you think so.
But it wasn't my idea.

599
01:18:34,977 --> 01:18:38,392
I didn't pretend to be better
than the Colonel.

600
01:18:46,786 --> 01:18:49,120
Spera persuaded me.

601
01:18:50,943 --> 01:18:52,911
And who brought in the hat?

602
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:56,262
And what was all that about
Baron Munchhausen, Mr. Spera?

603
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,198
I'd burn that hat.

604
01:19:56,946 --> 01:19:58,722
I'll keep it.

605
01:19:58,849 --> 01:20:02,744
It's a breeding ground
for all kinds of thoughts

606
01:20:03,606 --> 01:20:05,870
Wearing it, I can say anything

607
01:20:06,449 --> 01:20:09,488
without causing trouble.

608
01:20:09,813 --> 01:20:11,336
Good-bye, Regent.

609
01:20:12,351 --> 01:20:14,523
Good-bye, my little money-bank.

610
01:20:14,797 --> 01:20:15,805
What do you mean?

611
01:20:15,903 --> 01:20:18,801
May you have much success,
high interest rates.

612
01:20:19,055 --> 01:20:21,111
Keep your liver warm.

613
01:20:21,372 --> 01:20:24,582
Buy up the land
and hang on to Charosek.

614
01:20:25,103 --> 01:20:27,731
Let me tell the lawyer's future.

615
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:29,849
He won't get married.

616
01:20:30,549 --> 01:20:35,656
He'll get fat and drink
beer from the brewery.

617
01:20:36,339 --> 01:20:37,397
I don't get it.

618
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:40,671
Stoklasa's changing his mind.
He's fed up with you.

619
01:20:40,882 --> 01:20:42,053
Take it easy.

620
01:20:42,235 --> 01:20:45,163
No, let's really play
the Munchhausen game.

621
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:51,035
This slicked-down hair, this detachment.
You'll get tangled in politics.

622
01:20:55,707 --> 01:21:00,971
Good-bye, imbecile, pretending
you're in the old times.

623
01:21:01,268 --> 01:21:03,088
Tomorrow I"m leaving.

624
01:21:14,379 --> 01:21:16,313
Why don't you settle down?

625
01:21:16,775 --> 01:21:21,947
What for?
For a floozy and a square meal?

626
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:26,246
Shame on you,
you greedy bastard!

627
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:28,696
Women again!

628
01:21:29,149 --> 01:21:31,850
First you turn them on,
then you take off.

629
01:21:31,947 --> 01:21:35,267
Silence!
Duty obliges us to...

630
01:21:36,147 --> 01:21:38,082
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

631
01:21:38,923 --> 01:21:40,402
What is it?

632
01:21:40,606 --> 01:21:41,774
Mr. Colonel...

633
01:21:42,587 --> 01:21:44,462
We want to go with you.

634
01:21:44,736 --> 01:21:46,599
I've got an old blanket.

635
01:21:48,444 --> 01:21:51,315
We won't be any trouble,
Your Highness.

636
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:56,671
I appreciate your loyalty,
my dear friends.

637
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:01,571
I'll send for you.

638
01:22:12,176 --> 01:22:14,590
You even turn on the kids!

639
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,083
I'm not going anywhere!

640
01:22:19,587 --> 01:22:21,079
And neither are you!

641
01:22:21,844 --> 01:22:24,691
What are you doing!
Stop!

642
01:22:24,957 --> 01:22:26,889
Give back my clothes!

643
01:22:27,127 --> 01:22:30,397
How dare you?
Stop when I tell you!

644
01:22:31,138 --> 01:22:32,521
Stop!

645
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:34,870
I'll shoot you!

646
01:22:35,058 --> 01:22:36,440
For treason!

647
01:22:36,723 --> 01:22:41,905
I'll send you to Siberia!

648
01:23:15,802 --> 01:23:19,809
Help! It's dark!
I'm scared!

649
01:23:21,005 --> 01:23:22,769
May you starve to death!

650
01:23:30,958 --> 01:23:33,677
Where are you
taking me, Your Highness?

651
01:23:35,858 --> 01:23:37,850
What about Paris?

652
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:42,513
But wait till tomorrow.
And now to bed...

653
01:27:03,287 --> 01:27:07,286
Mr. Stoklasa's White Witch!

654
01:27:07,727 --> 01:27:09,216
Have a drink!

655
01:27:10,521 --> 01:27:12,012
My vintage wine!

656
01:27:12,164 --> 01:27:14,512
Spera, how long have you been
robbing my cellar?

657
01:27:17,216 --> 01:27:19,404
My antique chamber pot!

658
01:27:21,579 --> 01:27:24,725
You will be gone by tomorrow morning!

659
01:29:07,849 --> 01:29:09,617
Mr. Stoklasa,

660
01:29:10,821 --> 01:29:14,409
I want to forget everything
and to come to an understanding.

661
01:29:14,615 --> 01:29:16,603
You want the castle.

662
01:29:16,859 --> 01:29:19,536
We want the land.

663
01:29:20,174 --> 01:29:25,315
We need neither the lawyer nor Lhota.

664
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:29,195
We'll set up a cooperative
without them.

665
01:29:29,925 --> 01:29:31,175
Is that a deal?

666
01:29:32,251 --> 01:29:33,464
Mr. Charousek,

667
01:29:34,642 --> 01:29:39,263
the future belongs
to people like you!

668
01:30:47,988 --> 01:30:50,521
THE END OF OLD TIMES

669
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,412
THE END
