Poor or rich, aII peopIe are aIike.

Both rich and poor
ShaII Ieave for eternity.

00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:55,316

They wiIl in the end face death.

16
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:00,802
To work! Corvée!

17
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:11,285
To work! Corvée!

18
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:20,124
John, Andrew!
Come on, they are caIIing!

19
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:29,121
To work! Corvée!

20
00:03:57,087 --> 00:04:05,677
At the King Ridge
There is a green tree,

21
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:11,404
Its top is Ieaning downwards,
Its top is Ieaning downwards,

22
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:17,357
Its top is Ieaning down
to the SIovak ground.

23
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:20,279
Forging, are you?

24
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:25,923
Yes, I am. And you, where to?

25
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,756
Home.

26
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:32,005
It´s nice to go home sometimes.

27
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:37,122
Don´t you remember me?
I´m Pacho Matrtay.

28
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:45,286
I see now, it is you!
You´ve grown up.

29
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:46,766
Have I?

30
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:47,763
WeII, in fact, not much.

31
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:51,798
It is hard to grow taII
if you Iive in poverty.

32
00:04:52,487 --> 00:04:57,686
Your father and brothers don´t
expect you to come back.

33
00:04:57,887 --> 00:05:01,277
Your mother does. She used
to go to church to beg God.

34
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:03,603
And what about my Annie,
does she?

35
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:07,037
The one from the viIlage of Lehota.

36
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:12,364
WelI, I must be going.
It´s not good to be seen sitting around Iike this.

37
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:16,845
The young count Erdody
comes to the meadows often.

38
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,999
If he finds me here, I´II be in troubIe.

39
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:25,522
Why? You are not a serf.

40
00:05:25,687 --> 00:05:27,245
That is what bothers him.

41
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:31,644
Since the oId count died
he has gone wiId.

42
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:35,555
Like a deviI unIeashed.
WeII, good-bye.

43
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:38,246
And my Annie?

44
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:46,841
Annie, Mary, Susie,
they are aII aIike. Good-bye.

45
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:59,036
Pacho, you are back!?

46
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:25,760
These wouId be count Erdody´s serfs,
am I right?

47
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:26,757
Yes, Your Grace.

48
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:31,877
This wouId be peasants on corvée,
am I right?

49
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:33,640
Corvée, Your Grace!

50
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:36,441
I don´t think this is work!

51
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:38,678
Neither do I.

52
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:41,565
Move! Come on, to work!

53
00:06:41,607 --> 00:06:43,802
- SoIdier!
- Yes, Sir!

54
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:46,365

55
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,677
Of course, Your Grace...

56
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:54,087
SiIence! Do peopIe stiII work

57
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:58,125
Here we are, sir.

58
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:02,001
Show the fooI how to work!

59
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,323
PIease, we cannot work,
we´re aIl very iII.

60
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,164
Who asks you to work? PIay!

61
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:12,964
We´II pIay for count Erdody´s serfs!

62
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:27,400
PIay faster!

63
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:32,126
You, with the hoes, move!

64
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:35,635
Up and down! Up...

65
00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:39,676
Thats what I caII work!
Atreat for the eye!

66
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:43,840
SoIdier, don´t you know
a faster one?

67
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:47,639
I have sown rye,
but it won´t be mine...

68
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,395
Come on! PIay Iouder!

69
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:17,645
You see? Where is count Erdody?

70
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:20,281
l don´t know. At this time...

71
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:26,040
TeII him that count Nyari
sends him his best regards.

72
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:35,198
TeIl him the wagons from Vienna
are on their way!

73
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:37,925
Yes, Your Grace!

74
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:41,722
And that I am Iooking forward
to the baIl!

75
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:56,967
Matrtay! Your Pacho is back!

76
00:08:56,967 --> 00:09:00,755
My God, l knew it!

77
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:05,677
I had a dream! l knew it!

78
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:08,198
What? Our son Pacho?

79
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:12,045
Andrew, John, do you hear?

80
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:16,076
It is high time. We have done
enough of his work.

81
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:39,962
WeII now... Look!

82
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:44,755

00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:50,679
Whats going on?

84
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,076
Have mercy, sir...

85
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:58,243
I need some wood!

86
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:01,322
Here I am, your humbIe servant...

87
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:03,727
You Iazy dog!

88
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:05,877
My daughter went to do my work!

89
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:16,800
You bastard, how dare you!?

00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:24,684

- Give me the whip!
- Go to heII!

94
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:31,919
Heres the whip. Here you are,
Your Grace. Go on!

95
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,364
It hurts! Ouch, that hurts!

96
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:42,926
Here. Hit me!

97
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:46,444
Help yourseIf, Your Grace!

98
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:11,884
We are good peopIe.

99
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:15,603
God... God...

100
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:23,316
God-fearing.

101
00:11:32,847 --> 00:11:34,519
WeIl now...

102
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:39,286
We wouIdn´t hurt a fIy.

103
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,635
Not even a fIy. Why shouId we?

104
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:54,927
I think it´s going to rain...

105
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:00,198
What nonsense?

106
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,957
WelI now... the sky is cIear.

107
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:05,761
Where is he?

108
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:07,321
Catch him!

109
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:32,125
He must be hungry,
he´s shaking.

110
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:33,919
He seems Iike a nice chap.

111
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:35,520
WeII, wilI you join us?

112
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,484
No, no.

113
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:40,605
Handsome, nice figure.

114
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:43,121
As straight as a rod...

115
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:46,796
WelI now... his muscIes
are Iike...weII...

116
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:48,320
Like his own mother´s chiId.

117
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:50,923
No, no...

118
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,323
He´s one of us aIready!

119
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:58,764
How´s that? I am going home.
I haven´t been there for a Iong time.

120
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:04,197
You beat up a nobleman,
you cant go home.

121
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:07,636
Am I a brigand now?

122
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,925
Are you armed?

123
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:18,284
Join us then!

124
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:22,526
As a captain onIy.

125
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:28,877
First youd have to test
your strength against me.

126
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:34,877
Let´s test him.


128
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:06,319
Stop me if you can!

129
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:22,362
WeII now!

130
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:11,398
SiIence them if you can.

131
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:15,840
SiIence!

132
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,718
Shut up!

133
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:25,883
WiII you shut up?!

134
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:36,440
Come on!

135
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:47,278
You can go on now!

136
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:29,401
Have you got nothing stronger?

137
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:36,363
Cat´s piss!

138
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:19,483
Gunpowder.

139
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:36,559
Here, captain!

140
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:50,317
You did that... weII now... on purpose?

141
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,323
WeII...

142
00:17:57,687 --> 00:18:04,126
NobIe wagons on the road!
They must be loaded with goId!

143
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:07,638
- Where?
- Not far from Vazec!

144
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:10,845
Mount the horses!

145
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:13,845
We don´t have any!

146
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:16,846
Let´s run then!

147
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:26,646
How shaIl we do that?

148
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:31,640
III whistIe a signaI and you try
to manage somehow.

149
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:34,844
I know what to do.
KiII them aII!

150
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:36,280
I can whistIe too.

151
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:40,882
Stop! Later.

152
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:42,201
Just showing you I can.

153
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:44,886
No vioIence.

154
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:47,083
If you insist, you can kick
or sIap them.

155
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:52,324
WeII take up positions in the viIIage
where they won´t see us.

156
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:59,122
John, when theyre cIose,
shout: Halt, a thousand buIIets!

157
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:03,046
They´II get scared and fIee.
WiII you remember?

158
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:06,762
Sure I wiII. YouII hide, I shout:
HaIt, three hundred buIIets!

159
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:10,516
One thousand. Three hundred
are not enough.. Let´s go.

160
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:18,560
HaIt, three hundred buIIets!

161
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:21,642
HaIt, three hundred buIIets!

162
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:25,400
HaIt, one thousand buIIets!

163
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:31,166
HaIt, one thousand three hundred
buIIets! Are you deaf?

164
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,447
Why don´t you stop? Can´t you
see Im a brigand?

165
00:19:35,447 --> 00:19:37,039
Damn you!

166
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:40,161
Pacho, where are you?
They don´t beIieve me!

167
00:19:40,607 --> 00:19:42,086
Let´s go!

168
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:01,322
Whats going on in here?

169
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,715
Tie him up!

170
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:26,239
What are you doing, damn it?!

171
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:39,558
PeopIe, come here!

172
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:44,484
Come! We´re giving out money!

173
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:53,362
What kind of money is this?

174
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,286
Where´s the goId?

175
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:08,642
We know nothing about any goId,
mister brigand.

176
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:14,484
This is for count Erdody
for his birthday baII.

177
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:16,125
- BaII?
- BaII.

178
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,165
They are hosting a balI!

179
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:21,918
WeII be the first
to have some fun.

180
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:27,485
OId chap, show the ones
from Vienna how to pIay for dancing.

181
00:21:32,767 --> 00:21:35,725
PeopIe, everything is yours!

182
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:24,321
Pacho! Here...

183
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:36,526
We shaII deIiver this to Hybe
to my mother.

184
00:23:01,287 --> 00:23:07,396
Damn it, bIast it, bIoody heII!

185
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:16,036
What happened?

186
00:23:16,247 --> 00:23:18,966
Brigands kiIIed us aII, sir.

187
00:23:21,807 --> 00:23:25,641
- What? AII?
- To the Iast man!

188
00:23:25,727 --> 00:23:28,116
My beautifuI gowns!

189
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:34,198
Designed in Vienna! Look,
honey, what theyve done to them!

190
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,925
It can be washed!

191
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:39,524
Theyre aII torn!

192
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:40,556
It can be stitched together!

193
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:44,286
It is useIess now.
Good for the fire!

194
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:48,164
Good idea.

195
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:18,363
Look!

196
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:26,599
I did not expect to see you again.

197
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:30,117
The other day I had a dream
that the earth opened.

198
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:34,396
Then I knew you wouId come back.

199
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:37,715
I´II fetch some miIk.

200
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:43,598
How far have you been?

201
00:24:45,287 --> 00:24:47,039
As far as Constantinople, father.

202
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:48,042
Is it far?

203
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:51,039
On foot, you wouIdn´t get there
in one year.

204
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:53,237
In the middIe of nowhere.

205
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:57,407
While you were wandering around
we worked hard.

206
00:24:57,407 --> 00:25:00,763
He´s been through a lot too!

207
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,159
Have some miIk?

208
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:09,638
He runs off to the worId
and when he comes back to join the bandits.

209
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:11,644
That´s easy!

210
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:15,726
Shut up! Where there´s nobIemen,
there must be bandits too.

211
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:18,085
- Am I right?
-Yes, you are.

212
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:23,276
The nights in the mountains
are coId.

213
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:28,038
They warm themseIves up somehow,
won´t they?

214
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:31,957
To your heaIth.

215
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:33,645
To yours, father.

216
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:40,517
I must begin to piIIage.
They made me their captain.

217
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:43,003
The feIIows need me, I can´t Iet them down.

218
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:49,803
But one day III Ieave
the hiIls and get married.

219
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,203
l wonder if there´s a girI
waiting for you!

220
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:54,606
Fire!

221
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:59,325
WeII now... Vazec is on fire!

222
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:01,682
-Who set it on fire?
- Count Erdody.

223
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:08,084
- Pacho, Vazec is on fire!
- Gunpowder!

224
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:12,001
- What? Here it is!
- Let´s go then!

225
00:26:12,327 --> 00:26:14,204
You didn´t drink your miIk!

226
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:19,681
Don´t worry, mother,
I´II be back. You take care!

227
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:23,163
Bandits! Scum of the earth!

228
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:28,007
Countess PaIffy says,
brigands smoke such strong tobacco

229
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:29,520
that it dazes women.

230
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:33,003
DarIing, she has never seen
a Iiving brigand in her Iife.

231
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:34,966
Why, have you?

232
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:40,516
l kilIed more than
the number of fingers on both my hands.

233
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:46,121
What does a brigand Iook
like? TeII me, pIease.

234
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:49,322
Nothing pecuIiar. Brutes.

235
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:52,319
Brutes, you say!?

236
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:56,760
Dirty and unshaven, hairy, scruffy men.

237
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:59,275
Hairy? On their chests too?

238
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,882
Their chests too.
They are hair on their whoIe body. Like monkeys.

239
00:27:04,647 --> 00:27:08,276
What a birthday... in an oId dress!

240
00:27:08,647 --> 00:27:10,683
I was so Iooking forward to the baII!

241
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:14,323
Don´t cry, my dear,
III give you whatever you want.

242
00:27:17,327 --> 00:27:21,240
Whatever? I want a brigand then!

243
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:25,603
AII right.
I´lI catch you one aIive.

244
00:27:27,927 --> 00:27:31,078
Stop!

245
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:33,562
HoId this!

246
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,836
-Your Grace!
-What happened, Geyza?

247
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:40,685
Fire, Your Grace!

248
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:43,884
Fire! IIl be happy to take a Iook.

249
00:27:43,927 --> 00:27:45,997
Darling, I´II be right back.

250
00:27:50,807 --> 00:27:53,958
Your Grace! Heavens... It´s on fire!

251
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,242
I know, l see.

252
00:27:56,567 --> 00:28:02,164
An impressive fire that is.

253
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,805
Huge, Your Grace.

254
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:05,684
It Iooks Iike a big buiIding, doesn´t it?

255
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:08,605
Yes, sir. It´s the biggest one around.

256
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:12,642
The biggest one around here
is my chateau!

257
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:14,763
It was, Your Grace. It was.

258
00:28:16,407 --> 00:28:18,762
Our chateau!

259
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:23,123
Don´t worry, darIing.
We stiII have the Turnany CastIe Ieft.

260
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:25,597
I was getting tired of this one anyway.

261
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:29,078
Oh, what a IoveIy fire!

262
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:33,598
AbsoIuteIy. lt is a... weII now... tragedy!

263
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:53,639
Damn it, bIast it, bIoody heII!

264
00:28:54,287 --> 00:28:56,926
Who was it?

265
00:28:57,007 --> 00:28:58,645
Pacho, the brigand of Hybe!

266
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:00,197
Water, water!

267
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:02,761
III get him aIive!

268
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:06,475
Come on! More water!

269
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:16,322
He bIew a IittIe, and it was
on fire! WeII now, I swear!

270
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:17,840
Not even in heII do fires
burn so niceIy!

271
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:20,566
How do you know what it´s Iike in helI?
You´ve never been there.

272
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:23,121
Not me. My grandma told me.

273
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:25,443
Here´s to our Pacho!

274
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:45,559
Long Iive captain Pacho!

275
00:29:45,607 --> 00:29:48,041
You too, my dear boys!

276
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:53,000
And remember: God strikes
injustice with Iightning,

277
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:54,844
and a young man with buIIets!

278
00:29:55,647 --> 00:29:58,081
He is right, I swear!

279
00:29:58,127 --> 00:30:01,437
If it is not enough, nobIe Iords,
we can go on!

280
00:30:01,647 --> 00:30:05,481
If we want to, weII set alI the castIes
of the worId on fire!

281
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:08,962
- AII over the worId?
-Yes!

282
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:13,525
- The one in Lehota too?
- Too.

283
00:30:15,807 --> 00:30:18,196
Not onIy in Lehota! In Hradok too!

284
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:20,477
And Revuca... WeII now?

285
00:30:21,807 --> 00:30:25,766
We can set fires at the worId´s
end too. Even in Kezmarok.

286
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:29,165
Do you know where the worIds
end is? Have you been there?

287
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:33,803
Not me, my grandma told me.

288
00:30:33,887 --> 00:30:39,598
She says there is a Iong fence
and behind it... nothing.

289
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:42,725
Not true!

290
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:49,037
There is water at the worId´s end.
And then another water.

291
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:54,358
Further away is yet a third water.

292
00:30:54,967 --> 00:31:00,166
Behind the third water, aII the way there
is the fence you mentioned.

293
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,600
So much water? I don´t beIieve it!

294
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:17,158
If you know everything, Pacho,
say something wise.

295
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:28,242
Don´t make compromises in your Iife
as Iong as you´re not stabbed with a knife!

296
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:45,282
Now it´s your turn.

297
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:58,082
You see... Let´s have a dinner party!

298
00:32:30,847 --> 00:32:35,363
If they piss me off,
I´lI set their fence on fire too.

299
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:46,286
Oh, my dear Annie, where are you?

300
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:54,996
What? How...?

301
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:44,197
PeopIe of Hybe,
you pay for your mistake.

302
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:59,599
WelI, sweethearts,
did you have sweet dreams?

303
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:03,362
You´re Pacho´s father, aren´t you?
And his brothers...?

304
00:35:03,527 --> 00:35:06,405
Im onIy a distant reIative.

305
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:11,517
My grandmother´s cousin´s
husband...

306
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,363
Hush!

307
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:22,040
How is your dear son Pacho doing?

308
00:35:22,127 --> 00:35:24,357
Hes a rascaI, Your Grace!

309
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:28,042
Scoundrel, that´s what he is!

310
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:33,761
A pagan, Iet him be damned
wherever he is!

311
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:35,360
Good, that´s enough!

312
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:41,560
What does Pacho Iook Iike? TalI?

313
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:44,764
Who knows.
He may have grown up a IittIe.

314
00:35:48,567 --> 00:35:51,127
Does he smoke a pipe?

315
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:53,198
- Perhaps he does.
- One Iike this?

316
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:53,924
Maybe.

317
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:58,796
-What does he wear on his head?
- A hat, sir.

318
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:01,321
- One Iike this?
- ExactIy.

319
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:04,401
Does he wear a beIt?

320
00:36:04,447 --> 00:36:06,756
Yes, he does. Otherwise
he wouId Iose his trousers.

321
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:08,081
Down with his trousers!

322
00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:18,281
- Does he dance foIk dances?
- Yes, he does.

323
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:19,316
How? Show me!

324
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:26,642
Enough. Let´s go!

325
00:36:32,247 --> 00:36:35,444
- Is he hairy?
-Yes, he is.

326
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:37,877
- His chest too?
- That too.

327
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:46,843
That´s the Iast thing we needed...
We shaII be coId in here.

328
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:13,844
Erdody! It´s you!?

329
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:34,278
SiIence!

330
00:38:48,767 --> 00:38:50,644
Father!

331
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:53,840
My dear brothers! Here I am!

332
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:59,727
Defending your Iord in the morning
here´s the reward in the evening.

333
00:38:59,727 --> 00:39:01,638
Untie them!

334
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:10,525
Don´t worry, I, the brigands´
captain, shaII not Iet you down!

335
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:12,723
- Come here!
-Yes, father?

336
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:15,685
Off with your trousers!

337
00:39:29,687 --> 00:39:32,645
Father!

338
00:39:50,927 --> 00:39:54,044
The brigands´ captain is coming!

339
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:57,803
Oh my, he´s piIIaged a Iot
of goId and things, Iook!

340
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:02,640
We arent scared
when Pacho is with us.

341
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:08,482
He is said to have set three
manor houses on fire!

342
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:15,237
His trousers burnt there too.

343
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:19,965
Where are your trousers?

344
00:40:20,007 --> 00:40:24,683
He is the famous brigand!
AII the Iords are scared to death!

345
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:27,958
Hands up, trousers down!

346
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:34,642
Gunpowder! No! Mount the horses!

347
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:39,396
- But...
- I know. Let´s run then!

348
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:47,404
Load!

349
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:56,320
Shoot the Iords with gunpowder Iiquor! Fire!

350
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:33,601
HaIt!

351
00:43:39,447 --> 00:43:40,960
HaIt! WeIl now!

352
00:43:53,087 --> 00:43:56,875
- WeII now!
- What´s up?

353
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:02,404
A messenger is here to see you.

354
00:44:06,247 --> 00:44:07,680
Let him enter.

355
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:12,677
WeIl now...

356
00:44:20,647 --> 00:44:24,765
HighIy esteemed brigands´

361
00:44:54,247 --> 00:45:00,561
who wouId like to come and see

362
00:45:00,967 --> 00:45:01,843

Let them come

364
00:45:13,727 --> 00:45:16,799
- WeII now... with their daughters
and wives. - Daughters and wives...

365
00:45:18,647 --> 00:45:24,517
Without soIdiers, otherwise there
shaII be a Iot of havoc!

366
00:45:25,007 --> 00:45:28,795
Havoc... without soIdiers...

367
00:45:31,927 --> 00:45:33,838
There is no tobacco.

368
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:38,245
Sad, I understand. No tobacco.

369
00:45:38,287 --> 00:45:39,037
You´II get some.

370
00:45:39,127 --> 00:45:41,197
WeII, Ieave in the name of God.

371
00:45:52,407 --> 00:45:58,801
Listen! Next time dress up
when you come see the captain.

372
00:46:00,087 --> 00:46:02,157
- I kiss your hand.
- I kiss ya hand.

373
00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:05,000
- I bow low.
- I bow low.

374
00:46:06,447 --> 00:46:11,123
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

375
00:46:13,847 --> 00:46:15,360
- Good day.
- Good day.

376
00:46:15,447 --> 00:46:17,358
- I Iove you.
- I Iove you.

377
00:46:18,127 --> 00:46:21,642
l shaII give you aIl my Iove.

378
00:46:25,007 --> 00:46:27,999
I heard they have hairy chests
Iike monkeys!

379
00:46:29,407 --> 00:46:31,367
How do you know that so weII, Countess?

380
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:33,164
He must be hanged!

381
00:46:37,647 --> 00:46:40,957
When they Iook at you
it gives you the creeps!

382
00:46:41,447 --> 00:46:44,245
I hear they aIso bite.

383
00:46:45,407 --> 00:46:50,003
l hear they are wiId and rip
women´s cIothes of right away!

384
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,359
WonderfuI... I mean... terribIe!

385
00:46:53,487 --> 00:46:56,206
Oh my God, can you imagine?

386
00:46:56,967 --> 00:46:58,366
Who is to speak?

387
00:46:59,527 --> 00:47:02,246
I propose Count Forgacs.

388
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:05,962
My vocabuIary is poor.

389
00:47:06,087 --> 00:47:08,442
Correspondence,
that is something different.

390
00:47:08,967 --> 00:47:10,798
Baron Banfy couId do that.

391
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:12,919
Out of the question, gentIemen.

392
00:47:13,007 --> 00:47:15,077
I suffered a serious shock
when I was a chiId.

393
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:19,957
I lose my memory in high aItitudes.

394
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,965
WeII, what about Count Seredy?

395
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:28,605
Me? By no means!
I don´t know a word in SIovak!

396
00:47:28,647 --> 00:47:32,322
GentIemen! I´II speak.

397
00:47:32,447 --> 00:47:37,999
He´s my serf. You aII wait
as we agreed.

398
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,078
Theyre coming!

399
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:57,564
Theyre coming!

400
00:48:24,767 --> 00:48:29,283
- WeII now...
- Come on! Usher us in!

401
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:34,566
WeIl now...

402
00:48:49,487 --> 00:48:51,239
WeIl now...

403
00:48:54,047 --> 00:49:00,680
Have we got the priviIege to speak
to Pacho, the brigands´ captain?

404
00:49:00,767 --> 00:49:03,645
Right. Take a seat, pIease, Mr...

405
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:08,280
What...? You don´t know me?... Erdody!

406
00:49:08,367 --> 00:49:12,724
Oh, I see. The Erdody who had
the manor house down there?

407
00:49:12,807 --> 00:49:15,321
AbsoIuteIy. Now, enough of taIk!

408
00:49:15,407 --> 00:49:17,796
AII right. Sit down, gentIemen.

409
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:22,325
Count Orszag.

410
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:25,357
Count Kanizsay.

411
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:27,117
Count Forgacs.

412
00:49:27,727 --> 00:49:28,159
Szeredy.

413
00:49:30,007 --> 00:49:31,565
Count Szentivanyi.

414
00:49:32,247 --> 00:49:33,475
- I am Erdody.
- I know.

415
00:49:38,807 --> 00:49:43,756
- He should be hanged!
- Nice to meet you. Pacho.

416
00:49:51,847 --> 00:49:53,485
Stop the poIite nonsense, damn it!

417
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:58,284
PIease, Your Grace, if possibIe,

418
00:49:58,327 --> 00:50:00,841
do not use the phrase ´damn it.
Mind the Iadies.

419
00:50:06,487 --> 00:50:07,317
I am sorry.

420
00:50:08,447 --> 00:50:12,281
Bravo! It is nice in here. Cozy.

421
00:50:12,367 --> 00:50:15,837
WiII you spend the winter here
or do you pIan to Ieave for the south?

422
00:50:15,927 --> 00:50:19,363
It depends. There´s stiII a Iot of work to do.

423
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:20,721
He must be hanged!

424
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,519
WouId you Iike some Tokai wine, madam?

425
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:25,844
Tokai? Here, in the cave?

426
00:50:25,967 --> 00:50:28,720
If you wish you can be served
on the meadow.

427
00:50:28,847 --> 00:50:30,803
The year of 1703.

428
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:37,196
1703? I remember. That is aII right.

429
00:50:37,407 --> 00:50:43,039
-WeII now...
-WeII now... madam...

430
00:50:48,327 --> 00:50:51,046
How was the waIk up the hiII?
I´m afraid it´s a IittIe steep, isn´t it?

431
00:50:51,087 --> 00:50:53,362
We were somewhat out of breath.
But the fresh air...!

432
00:50:53,487 --> 00:50:56,365
I saw wiId strawberries are ripening
nearby.

433
00:50:56,447 --> 00:50:59,883
We have noticed too. You can
pick some on your way down.

434
00:51:00,287 --> 00:51:02,482
To your heaIth, captain!

435
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:06,526
To me!

436
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:11,325
And how have you been?
Everything aIl right I hope?

437
00:51:11,407 --> 00:51:12,635
Our house has been destroyed
by fire.

438
00:51:12,727 --> 00:51:15,241
You don´t say! What a shame!

439
00:51:21,887 --> 00:51:23,605
You Iike fire, don´t you.

440
00:51:23,767 --> 00:51:26,679
Fire is a good servant
but a bad master.

441
00:51:27,047 --> 00:51:29,038
There was a fire at our pIace too!

442
00:51:30,727 --> 00:51:32,080
Everything burnt down?

443
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,566
AII in ashes.

444
00:51:34,647 --> 00:51:36,080
And that´s not aII.

445
00:51:36,647 --> 00:51:39,286
There is so IittIe now to Iive on here.

446
00:51:39,407 --> 00:51:44,959
You shouId stop robbing and
starting fires, dear Pacho.

447
00:51:45,287 --> 00:51:47,517
We need a pIace to Iive too!

448
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:50,965
Do you want to buy me for money?

449
00:51:51,047 --> 00:51:56,485
No, we don´t. We want to settIe
our affair to avoid a tragedy.

450
00:51:58,527 --> 00:52:00,722
It may happen.

451
00:52:01,847 --> 00:52:03,644
You must mend your ways, gentIemen!

452
00:52:03,807 --> 00:52:04,956
We shaII see!

453
00:52:05,407 --> 00:52:10,606
Dear Pacho, the brigand of
Hybe, you´re trapped! Let´s go!

454
00:52:22,447 --> 00:52:27,362
Damn it, bIast it, bIoody heII!

455
00:52:27,927 --> 00:52:30,441
Now, your soIdiers Iie on the ground
Iike wood in the forest.

456
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,915
You´re right, youre trapped

457
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:46,399
SIovak brigands rob the rich
and give to the poor.

458
00:52:47,687 --> 00:52:48,961
FeIIows!

459
00:53:00,647 --> 00:53:03,957
I am not satisfied with
your nobIe manners, gentIemen!

460
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:18,165
The rich treat the poor Iike
the woIf does the ram,

461
00:53:18,327 --> 00:53:23,117
therefore do not join the company
of the rich if you don´t have to.

462
00:53:23,247 --> 00:53:32,280
Don´t go if he caIIs you,
you shaII be happy without him.

463
00:53:36,327 --> 00:53:40,286
We´II give everything to the needy
there is no shame in being poor.

464
00:53:45,687 --> 00:53:51,364
We can pay due respect to guests Iike you!

465
00:53:51,447 --> 00:53:56,396
HumbIe hearts have humbIe desires.
A Iong tongue - a short hand.

466
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:59,565
Dance with the Iadies, feIIows!

467
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:04,397
What has my boy got in his shirt?

468
00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:06,677
Stop it, madam, it tickIes!

469
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,602
Bite me!

470
00:56:12,887 --> 00:56:15,879
No... no...

471
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,563
Stop annoying me!

472
00:56:21,567 --> 00:56:24,843
Why are you scratching me?
I´II pinch you!

473
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:29,881
Take me!
Do whatever you want with me!

474
00:56:30,567 --> 00:56:33,081
No, no...

475
00:56:49,127 --> 00:56:52,403
That´s aII I need!
She wanted to vioIate me!

476
00:56:52,887 --> 00:56:59,360
Pigs! l couIdn´t Iook my Annie in the eye!

477
00:57:20,487 --> 00:57:27,802
Its time to go home.

478
00:57:47,687 --> 00:57:49,439
Annie!

479
00:57:49,487 --> 00:57:50,761
My dear Annie!

480
00:57:54,527 --> 00:57:58,156
I thought you were not Iike this.

481
00:57:59,887 --> 00:58:02,720
I had waited for you for fourteen years.

482
00:58:03,087 --> 00:58:05,760
I have known Mike for seven onIy.

483
00:58:05,887 --> 00:58:12,884
You know how much work there is
around the house.

484
00:58:12,967 --> 00:58:15,481
Our Iords have no mercy.

485
00:58:16,487 --> 00:58:21,686
That´s it, the Iords are to bIame!

486
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:56,162
There´s many rivers in the worId,
Another man is with my girI.

487
00:58:56,287 --> 00:59:02,237
I wish he were dead,
And I couId be in her bed.

488
00:59:04,647 --> 00:59:10,119
Oh, Iords, wait! You´II see something!

489
00:59:17,647 --> 00:59:22,118
HeIIo there! I am here to compIain.

490
00:59:24,447 --> 00:59:29,965
Listen, God, aIthough you shouId
aIready know aII this.

491
00:59:33,847 --> 00:59:37,886
I have fought but never hurt
a weaker one.

492
00:59:39,287 --> 00:59:44,725
I have not Iied, or betrayed,
and have aIways been faithfuI.

493
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:51,120
I onIy robbed the rich,

494
00:59:52,087 --> 00:59:54,442
and gave everything to the poor.

495
00:59:55,567 --> 00:59:58,877
I even began robbing
but the Iords are to bIame.

496
01:00:00,527 --> 01:00:05,920
You yourseIf can see from above
the poverty we Iive in.

497
01:00:07,247 --> 01:00:11,399
As for my sins... I have aImost none.

498
01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:18,925
Even my beIoved is unfaithfuI to me!

499
01:00:20,487 --> 01:00:22,842
And my father sIapped me!

500
01:00:23,967 --> 01:00:27,277
And my brothers... I´d rather
you didn´t ask!

501
01:00:28,847 --> 01:00:33,159
What do you say? Nothing?

502
01:00:34,967 --> 01:00:37,037
I bet you are on their side!

503
01:00:38,007 --> 01:00:41,079
I wiII show the Iords something! I shaII
set aII their houses on fire!

504
01:00:41,967 --> 01:00:45,960
III show something to you too, Lord!

505
01:00:48,287 --> 01:00:48,958
Gunpowder Iiquor!

506
01:00:58,927 --> 01:01:02,203
Quiet!

507
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:10,523
He has set two of my mansions
on fire! Put it down!

508
01:01:10,607 --> 01:01:13,440
And stoIe my horses!

509
01:01:13,527 --> 01:01:15,199
He stoIe my cows and sheep!

510
01:01:15,287 --> 01:01:17,164
He has vioIated and abused our wives!

511
01:01:17,247 --> 01:01:18,999
That is true!

512
01:01:19,087 --> 01:01:22,159
He humiIiates us by his pride!

513
01:01:22,967 --> 01:01:23,877
Be quiet!

514
01:01:27,727 --> 01:01:33,518
Write he is very taII.
That wiII sound credibIy!

515
01:01:33,687 --> 01:01:39,159
When attacking he is strong
Iike two squadrons! Write.

516
01:01:42,447 --> 01:01:43,880
As if he were shooting with his eyes!

517
01:01:44,727 --> 01:01:50,085
And he has eyes Iike a boar!

518
01:01:50,167 --> 01:01:52,886
And the nose Iike a pig´s snout!

519
01:01:52,967 --> 01:01:55,356
In a word, a monster!

520
01:01:57,127 --> 01:01:59,004
Be siIent!

521
01:02:02,967 --> 01:02:06,198
Don´t worry, everything is written down.

522
01:02:07,007 --> 01:02:14,436
As for Pacho, our empress
Maria Theresa wiII take care of him.

523
01:02:15,207 --> 01:02:20,156
MerciIess brigand named Pacho
has been rampaging in Upper Hungary.

524
01:02:20,247 --> 01:02:22,966
He sets our houses on fire, and
seduces our wives and daughters.

525
01:02:23,047 --> 01:02:28,326
He turns the peopIe of our vilIages
against you.

526
01:02:28,407 --> 01:02:31,001
He keeps escaping us.

527
01:02:31,087 --> 01:02:34,238
If it goes on Iike this
who knows how we wiII end up.

528
01:02:34,327 --> 01:02:38,161
When he gets us he may aIso
set out for Vienna.

529
01:02:38,207 --> 01:02:44,077
Therefore we humbIy ask you
to send us an army, Your Majesty.

530
01:02:44,207 --> 01:02:52,842
Your Ioyal servants from Upper
Hungary, that is, from SIovakia.

531
01:03:06,687 --> 01:03:09,485
SIovakia... SIovakia...

532
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:14,840
Hybe... Hybe... Where is Hybe?

533
01:03:14,927 --> 01:03:20,320
In Upper Hungary, caIIed SIovakia.

534
01:03:21,567 --> 01:03:29,679
Here, this is TransyIvania, and here...
this is GaIicia.

535
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:35,678
SIovakia... SIovakia...
Where is it?

536
01:03:36,407 --> 01:03:39,205
A Liptov Region.

537
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:42,046
Liptov.

538
01:03:45,287 --> 01:03:50,759
Your Majesty, there are some
brickIayers here.

539
01:03:50,847 --> 01:03:53,202
From the Liptov Region, I think.

540
01:04:26,887 --> 01:04:31,881
Joey!

541
01:04:36,007 --> 01:04:39,443
Joe, where are you?

542
01:04:43,607 --> 01:04:45,643
Morning, Your Majesty.

543
01:04:48,687 --> 01:04:51,326
Are you a brickIayer from Liptov?

544
01:04:51,407 --> 01:04:56,925
Yes, Majesty, from Liptov,
from the viIIage caIIed Vychodna.

545
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:07,363
And do you know where Hybe is?

546
01:05:07,447 --> 01:05:10,325
Yes, I do, Your Majesty.

547
01:05:11,927 --> 01:05:15,158
Not far from Vychodna,
at a stone´s throw.

548
01:05:17,407 --> 01:05:19,159
Wow, what heaven in my mouth!

549
01:05:19,247 --> 01:05:24,924
Do you know Pacho,
the brigand from Liptov?

550
01:05:25,007 --> 01:05:30,877
Of course! Your Majesty, I used to
graze sheep with him.

551
01:05:31,807 --> 01:05:34,002
Sheep?

552
01:05:37,527 --> 01:05:41,122
TeII me. Is he Iike you?

553
01:05:41,967 --> 01:05:43,320
Like me.

554
01:05:44,687 --> 01:05:49,807
Even taIIer. He is robust, strong...

555
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,641
Stronger than you?

556
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,483
Much stronger.

557
01:05:56,687 --> 01:06:02,398
And what about his nose?

558
01:06:02,487 --> 01:06:09,563
Twice as big as mine, Majesty.
And he is a great rascaI.

559
01:06:11,807 --> 01:06:16,244
You shaII deIiver him a Ietter. But...

560
01:06:58,007 --> 01:07:01,238
Come on, Joe! Stop it!

561
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:23,883
I send you many greetings.

562
01:07:26,087 --> 01:07:28,203
-What...
-What what? WeII now...

563
01:07:28,607 --> 01:07:32,202
What do you do? How are you?

564
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:46,960
I need a strong man Iike you
here in Vienna,

565
01:07:47,047 --> 01:07:55,159
at the imperiaI and royaI court,
by my side.

566
01:07:56,447 --> 01:08:00,326
- And therefore...
- Go on reading!

567
01:08:00,407 --> 01:08:03,763
- What´s next?
- I´m embarrassed.

568
01:08:03,847 --> 01:08:06,077
Why shouId you... weII now...
be embarrassed...

569
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:10,797
- I´m too shy.
- Read, don´t worry!

570
01:08:12,247 --> 01:08:14,203
She wants me for her husband.

571
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:25,246
Has she ever seen you?

572
01:09:33,167 --> 01:09:39,481
TeII the empress I do not
want to get married.

573
01:09:40,087 --> 01:09:41,998
In that case I´m not going back there.

574
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:49,158
Otherwise Her Majesty
wouId persecute me too much.

575
01:09:49,247 --> 01:09:55,083
Where is Pacho?

576
01:09:55,207 --> 01:10:01,396
I must get him! I want him!

577
01:10:04,207 --> 01:10:05,925
Where is Pacho?

578
01:10:16,447 --> 01:10:24,320
No message! No hint!

579
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:29,361
Not a word back!

580
01:10:31,647 --> 01:10:35,959
What dares he? I am the head
of Austria-Hungary!

581
01:10:38,007 --> 01:10:40,726
lt is an offence of my majesty!

582
01:10:42,767 --> 01:10:50,117
I want him! SIovakia! Liptov! Hybe!

583
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:55,321
III destroy it aII!

584
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:05,683
Here is his signature.

585
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:15,960
I want him aIive.

586
01:11:19,327 --> 01:11:22,399
Yes, Your Majesty.

587
01:11:22,527 --> 01:11:25,166
Oh yes, this is no Iife.

588
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:32,640
Drinking spirits, or water
you have the same Ieak.

589
01:11:33,327 --> 01:11:35,761
Because you are incontinent!

590
01:11:36,687 --> 01:11:40,316
- I don´t think so.
- What about Susan?

591
01:11:40,407 --> 01:11:46,277
Susan has almost no tits.
Mary´s are the biggest.

592
01:11:48,967 --> 01:11:53,757
When a sheep sweIIs,
not even God can heIp.

593
01:11:53,847 --> 01:11:59,205
A shepherd under Pipitka HiIl
can cure swoIIen sheep.

594
01:11:59,287 --> 01:12:02,040
I don´t beIieve.
Once it is swoIIen, that´s it.

595
01:12:02,087 --> 01:12:05,284
There´s a reward of a thousand guIdens
on Pacho´s head.

596
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:08,757
Reward? I don´t care.

597
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:16,599
We have set many mansions on fire
but forgot Szentivany´s.

598
01:12:16,687 --> 01:12:19,599
-AII right. Tomorrow is a day too.
-AbsoIuteIy!

599
01:12:22,807 --> 01:12:31,636
IIl go to town in the morning,
betray him, grab the money,

600
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:37,836
drop in to Susan´s,
and wiII be back by nightfaII.

601
01:12:42,047 --> 01:12:45,119
l may be the captain again.

602
01:12:48,007 --> 01:12:52,478
Once we wanted to kiII a pig
but couId not catch it.

603
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:59,040
Pigs sIip out of your hands easiIy.

604
01:13:01,327 --> 01:13:04,717
- Do you understand, gentIemen?
- No!

605
01:13:04,807 --> 01:13:11,246
Once more. We are here.
Pacho and his men are here!

606
01:13:12,527 --> 01:13:14,802
Where am I?

607
01:13:18,047 --> 01:13:20,607
Here. Be carefuI!

608
01:13:21,287 --> 01:13:24,597
Pacho is no dwarf.

609
01:13:24,687 --> 01:13:31,684
He is a giant Iike Hercules.
Do you understand?

610
01:13:31,767 --> 01:13:33,723
No!

611
01:13:35,447 --> 01:13:40,646
Again! We are here...

612
01:13:40,727 --> 01:13:44,720
Let me be!

613
01:13:44,807 --> 01:13:47,241
GeneraI, I´m here to teII you
where to find Pacho.

614
01:13:47,327 --> 01:13:48,237
Where is he?

615
01:13:48,327 --> 01:13:50,636
In the mountains.
On the Honey Meadow among the cIiffs.

616
01:13:50,727 --> 01:13:52,046
How taIl is Pacho?

617
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,436
- Up to my shouIders.
- ShouIders?

618
01:13:54,487 --> 01:13:57,479
A short man. Where shaII I be
given the reward?

619
01:13:57,567 --> 01:14:00,957
I wouId Iike to buy a mare
on the market.

620
01:14:01,047 --> 01:14:06,485
You´re a Iiar!
Pacho is Iike HercuIes!

621
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:14,722
Tie him and throw him in the dungeon!

622
01:14:14,807 --> 01:14:17,605
I toId you everything!

623
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:19,279
You wiII pay for this!

624
01:14:19,367 --> 01:14:23,599
Pacho is short! You can step over him!

625
01:14:23,687 --> 01:14:25,678
Let me go!

626
01:14:27,887 --> 01:14:33,564
- Do you understand, gentIemen?
- No!

627
01:14:35,487 --> 01:14:41,323
Once again then. We are here...

628
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,682
Run! It´s a whoIe army!

629
01:15:08,767 --> 01:15:10,485
We are damned!

630
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:13,926
Don´t worry, felIows! Come here!

631
01:15:18,007 --> 01:15:19,998
We´II manage if we stick together.

632
01:15:20,047 --> 01:15:22,163
Take up your positions.
Everybody knows what to do.

633
01:15:22,207 --> 01:15:26,086
If it turns out badIy we shaII hide
in the cave -they won´t find us in there.

634
01:15:26,207 --> 01:15:29,995
Let´s have some gunpowder Iiquor now!

635
01:15:30,087 --> 01:15:34,763
- Good Iuck, Pacho.
- To you too, my boys.

636
01:16:19,727 --> 01:16:24,517
From the right! What is wrong? Go!

637
01:17:03,527 --> 01:17:05,995
Take them from the right,
and you, straight up to them!

638
01:17:07,847 --> 01:17:08,882
What is it?

639
01:17:11,087 --> 01:17:11,997
A baII!

640
01:17:26,647 --> 01:17:28,399
Pacho! Watch out!

641
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:22,357
Fire!

642
01:18:56,887 --> 01:18:59,242
Look for them!

643
01:19:06,087 --> 01:19:07,440
Go on, search!

644
01:19:26,727 --> 01:19:31,642
Don´t worry! They won´t find us here
before next spring.

645
01:20:00,367 --> 01:20:08,126
They chased me over fieIds
and meadows. We are trapped!

646
01:20:08,207 --> 01:20:11,483
Take it easy, we´II escape
through the hoIe in the back.

647
01:20:11,567 --> 01:20:13,285
Gunpowder Iiquor!

648
01:20:15,367 --> 01:20:17,722
AII gone.

649
01:20:19,327 --> 01:20:20,840
Let´s go!

650
01:20:23,207 --> 01:20:26,005
Good evening, gentIemen.

651
01:20:37,887 --> 01:20:44,645
Which of you is the giant,
the HercuIes, the famous Pacho?

652
01:20:50,127 --> 01:20:52,004
That is me.

653
01:20:57,367 --> 01:20:59,961
Pacho is Iike this! Out!

654
01:21:11,127 --> 01:21:14,437
Tie them up. Off to SpiIberg
prison with them!

655
01:21:23,127 --> 01:21:26,517
You heard, weII now... they are
taking us to SpiIberg.

656
01:21:26,567 --> 01:21:28,523
Good, I´ve never seen it yet.

657
01:21:29,247 --> 01:21:32,205
Don´t hurt them! It´s me, I am Pacho,
the brigand of Hybe.

658
01:21:32,247 --> 01:21:34,238
I swear, its him!

659
01:21:34,287 --> 01:21:38,246
You are too short.
And you´lI be even shorter.

660
01:21:40,127 --> 01:21:45,724
We must catch Pacho aIive.

661
01:21:45,807 --> 01:21:48,275
It is reaIIy him, the brigand of Hybe.

662
01:21:48,367 --> 01:21:49,925
Do you want to be dug in, too?

663
01:21:49,967 --> 01:21:52,606
- No.
- So kick him!

664
01:22:00,647 --> 01:22:05,801
lf aII ends weII,
weII meet at the market in Levoca!

665
01:22:07,527 --> 01:22:12,317
Boys, wheres my Pacho?

666
01:22:12,367 --> 01:22:15,837
Don´t worry, they´II never catch Pacho.

667
01:22:15,927 --> 01:22:18,687
- Mother!
- Dear Mum!

668
01:22:18,687 --> 01:22:22,566
Good Iuck, Mother!

669
01:22:57,207 --> 01:23:01,359
Don´t be siIly, I am a Iiving head.

670
01:23:01,447 --> 01:23:04,519
Come here, there is a head here!

671
01:23:06,527 --> 01:23:08,245
WeII, you are a head, aren´t you?

672
01:23:09,127 --> 01:23:11,721
Indeed, I am. A Iiving head.

673
01:23:11,767 --> 01:23:15,476
- They forgot about you and Ieft?
- As you see.

674
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:22,803
Thank you. What is your name?

675
01:23:22,847 --> 01:23:28,001
They caII me Pacho.
Yes, indeed. Pacho.

676
01:23:28,927 --> 01:23:32,317
But that´s me. I am Pacho,
the brigand of Hybe.

677
01:23:32,847 --> 01:23:39,878
Oh no! You are a head! I am Pacho,
the brigand of Hybe!

678
01:23:52,487 --> 01:24:01,486
At the King Ridge
There is a green tree,

679
01:24:05,367 --> 01:24:15,038
At the King Ridge
There is a green tree,

680
01:24:22,127 --> 01:24:28,566
- Can you hear that?
-Yes, I can.

681
01:24:28,647 --> 01:24:30,717
The whip...

682
01:24:32,727 --> 01:24:36,037
What a wonderfuI cracking sound.

683
01:24:37,607 --> 01:24:50,964
Its top is Ieaning down
to the SIovak ground.

684
01:24:52,927 --> 01:24:56,806
THE END
