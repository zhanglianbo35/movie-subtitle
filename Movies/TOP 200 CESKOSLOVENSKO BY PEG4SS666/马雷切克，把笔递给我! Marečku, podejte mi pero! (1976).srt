1
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:34,965
Hi, what's for lunch?

2
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:40,136
Is this everything you have for us?

3
00:00:40,236 --> 00:00:42,596
I may ask what's for lunch, no?

4
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:46,545
Yes. But may we ask you
how about your grades?

5
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:48,148
Oh, grades...

6
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:52,870
It may turn out that you won't be

7
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,569
getting lunch, you know?

8
00:00:58,218 --> 00:01:02,324
History... Mmm

9
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:05,535
Czech... You don't speak Czech?

10
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:07,429
Well...

11
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:10,101
Uuuugh...

12
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:16,350
Chemistry! Also nice.
So, Mum...

13
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:19,523
But I have an Excellent
in Math!

14
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:22,988
Give him some soup.
He doesn't deserve more!

15
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:27,898
Come here, Hujer!
You'll have to explain this -

16
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:31,201
Here, on Monday:
checked in at 6:00 and then

17
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,443
checked out at 6:02
and again in 6:03

18
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:38,146
What does it mean? That you wander
at the gate in and out?

19
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,636
I read the daily press.

20
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:48,122
I admire it. But we go to work
right on the first attempt! Take it...

21
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:17,066
Mr. Supervisor!

22
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:19,738
The sausages are on the table.

23
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:21,708
Thank you, Suzy, thank you.

24
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:22,758
Don't mention it.

25
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:44,540
So, the new building will be up to here?

26
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:47,843
A great deal of change is waiting for us.

27
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,158
They say we won't recognize
it when we see it.

28
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:18,134
No fear, George, you'll grasp it.

29
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:22,583
Oh yeah, no fear. They are building something decent, aren't they?

30
00:05:22,683 --> 00:05:27,327
I was talking about that schooling.
Not to be afraid about it.

31
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,871
We are not afraid of it, no.

32
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:32,883
A lot of people are interested -

33
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:34,680
here - Hloušek, Krabatý...

34
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,237
Hloušek, Krabatý!

35
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:37,387
What is it?

36
00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:38,937
Come here.

37
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:41,082
Moment

38
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:42,791
Even Famfula.

39
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:45,632
Famfula!
Famfula!

40
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:48,311
Come here!

41
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:56,568
Tell the comrade deputy Director
what you've decided about schooling.

42
00:05:56,942 --> 00:05:59,042
Well, yeah, I would go for it.

43
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,242
It's not about Famfula

44
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:03,342
Although we are glad that you
want to take that

45
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:05,084
welding course.

46
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:07,622
It's more about your high school, George

47
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:08,922
About mine?

48
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:12,672
Yes. In order to be a supervisor
in the new factory, you know.

49
00:06:13,502 --> 00:06:16,272
Wait, I was thinking the young would take over.

50
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:18,772
You wouldn't send us, the old people
with the bad knees

51
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:19,872
to school?

52
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:22,474
Look here. Given the automatic production

53
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:23,961
everything will change.

54
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,174
So, for example, here

55
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,817
Here an automatic transporter
will lead to the new building

56
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,074
There will be an enormous KL-2

57
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:39,774
And above everything,
There will be a glass observation tower.

58
00:06:40,863 --> 00:06:42,611
It will be so beautiful!

59
00:06:42,806 --> 00:06:45,558
Later, in the office, I will
show you the plans, you know.

60
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:48,326
And in that observation desk
a supervisor will sit

61
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:49,832
with a high school diploma.

62
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:53,491
He will possess a ruler...
a logarithmic one, of course.

63
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:56,130
And he will be automatically
above all...

64
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:57,813
...even salary wise.

65
00:06:58,186 --> 00:07:02,444
Well, I think it's not so desperate at all.
What would you say to that, George?

66
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,180
Well, as I have told you before

67
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:08,570
let anybody sit in that square tower, but

68
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,220
you won't get me in that school.

69
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:12,481
Hujer is raising a hand.

70
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:15,703
If you'd allow, comrade deputy Director,
in the case that I would

71
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:21,677
graduate that high school,
may I, as a quality control inspector, rely

72
00:07:21,804 --> 00:07:26,000
and I am not pushing myself into
comrade Kroupa's place,

73
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:28,137
could I hope for a glassed space?

74
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:30,565
Naturally.

75
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:33,398
It depends how comrade Kroupa will decide.

76
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:34,891
Oh, excellent!

77
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:38,709
And because comrade Kroupa
already has decided,

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,400
we could disband all this and everybody
could mind his own business.

79
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,208
Neruda.

80
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
That one.

81
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:47,241
In the cage with a lion spirit.

82
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:50,478
So, what kind of a problem is this?
To learn a pair of verses?

83
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:52,546
I did know it by heart,
but it fell out.

84
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:55,076
Fell out!
I went to school 30 years ago

85
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:56,647
and nothing has fallen out.

86
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,460
I remember some of the poems even today.

87
00:07:58,638 --> 00:08:01,487
For example:
„The mother has died

88
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:06,264
and they burried her.“
See? And wake me up in midnight

89
00:08:06,977 --> 00:08:08,562
„She left orphans behind...

90
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,864
Well, OK.
Now may I go swimming?

91
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,435
„They came every morning

92
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:17,209
and looked for their mother“
But you think about love notes

93
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:18,309
and not about school.

94
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:22,340
„And the mother felt sorry for the poor children...“

95
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,019
Ha-ha.  It's still there!

96
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,188
Somebody is ringing!

97
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:40,569
„...and her soul returned.“

98
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:45,584
Good evening!
Hi!

99
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:46,734
What has happened?

100
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:50,558
We would like to discuss with you
that issue,

101
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:51,898
that, well...

102
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:57,131
Enter, please. Enter.

103
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,324
That way, come on.

104
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:05,339
Now, George, we have contemplated
a long time about it.

105
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:07,518
We won't force you into anything.

106
00:09:07,618 --> 00:09:08,618
I wouldn't even advice you to try me.

107
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:13,159
But try to imagine it. When Hujer
graduates from that school

108
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:18,000
and you won't, it would be a disaster,
because he will fight for the supervisor job.

109
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,169
And you saw him how
crazy about it he was.

110
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:25,500
And I would have to, only because of Hujer,
at this age, learn formulas and write homeworks?

111
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,250
Mr. Kroupa, that you won't manage it?
Just don't say that.

112
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Look, the people at the workshop love you.

113
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:34,124
You are strict.
You won't turn a blind eye to anyone.

114
00:09:34,303 --> 00:09:38,024
You are also competent and just.
When I just imagine Hujer...

115
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:40,924
It's true, George, you won't do this to us.

116
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:43,508
Daddy, don't hesitate. You have good memory.

117
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:47,108
„The orphans behind her..“
You remember it more than 30 years.

118
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:50,858
Come on, go swimming!
You, advisor... as if I needed your advice.

119
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:52,608
The „best“ in class.

120
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:56,143
You see it George,
he's all after you.

121
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:58,361
OK, wait a sec.

122
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,647
Wait.

123
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:05,808
May I?

124
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:11,895
Look at this.

125
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:20,431
Even if you cut me in such tiny noodles

126
00:10:20,681 --> 00:10:24,181
you won't get me into any school!

127
00:10:24,251 --> 00:10:26,151
<i>We welcome the students
of the Technical High School</i>

128
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:28,101
We welcome you and
wish you a lot of success in school.

129
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:30,051
Here you have the school program.

130
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:32,796
We welcome you and
wish you a lot of success.

131
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Here you have the school program.

132
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,601
We welcome you and lots of success.

133
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:42,851
We welcome you and wish you
a lot of success.

134
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,801
Here you have.. Hi, Dad! Here
you have the school program.

135
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:50,051
Your clasroom is up and right
If you can't find it - it's the same as mine.

136
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:04,103
Is it free here?

137
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:05,285
Yes

138
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:12,401
<i>Kroupa is an ox.</i>

139
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:30,411
Šlajs!

140
00:11:30,642 --> 00:11:31,901
Tuček!

141
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:34,152
I won't ever get rid of him!
Sorry, we have been sitting

142
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,785
together since 1st grade and he's keeping
that place on the first desk for me.

143
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:38,952
Hi!

144
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:40,452
Hi! Man, where did you get this?

145
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,202
And where have you lost this?

146
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,002
You know, my wife.

147
00:11:44,682 --> 00:11:48,616
Here, in the school rules it is written
that the student should go to school

148
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,283
properly kept.

149
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:54,702
Does it mean that we have to
shave every day?

150
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,919
Good evening.

151
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:07,946
Evening!

152
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:09,952
Sit down.

153
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:19,202
Thank you.

154
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:22,152
Thank you.

155
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:38,091
Whose is this, please?

156
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:42,204
I took the liberty, for the occasion

157
00:12:42,446 --> 00:12:45,814
from my little garden... some plums,
if you don't find it insulting...

158
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,359
Well, really, from you,

159
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,318
maybe we can taste them in class,
everyone together.

160
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,216
No, no, please!
They are only for you!

161
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,985
OK, thank you.

162
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,923
My name is Čeněk Janda.
I am your class teacher.

163
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,704
This is good!

164
00:13:04,222 --> 00:13:05,808
Pardon?

165
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,301
Nothing, we are just glad.

166
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,187
Yes. I will teach you mathematics and...

167
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:15,133
Dear students of the evening technical school!

168
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,270
Excuse me.

169
00:13:17,675 --> 00:13:21,140
Allow me to.. [distortion]

170
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,232
This equipment has some years behind it.

171
00:13:24,993 --> 00:13:31,740
Comrade Director wanted to say, basically,
that he welcomes you, that

172
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:35,111
we have actually talked about it
at the council

173
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:40,244
that having to go to work every day
and from work to school,

174
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,546
this isn't really a joke.

175
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,675
But we, on our side
will do anything for you to succeed.

176
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:53,810
I will teach you mathematics and
descriptive geometry.

177
00:13:54,944 --> 00:13:58,700
And now, I would gladly
get to know you.

178
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,420
Březina?

179
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:03,281
You work as a..?

180
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:04,751
Locksmith.

181
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:05,851
Thank you.

182
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,895
Dudek.

183
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:09,773
Accountant.

184
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:11,749
Gregorová.

185
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,351
Turner.

186
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,962
Fulinová.

187
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,690
Toolmaker.

188
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:20,621
Yes. Thank you.

189
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,198
Aluminum?

190
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:26,336
Is Aluminum present?

191
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:28,893
Aluminum moved to Humpolec.

192
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,613
OK. We'll put that down.

193
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:32,941
Hujer?

194
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,041
Here.

195
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:35,141
Viktor.

196
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,241
Quality Control

197
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:37,235
for the moment.

198
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:39,145
Ah, we talked.

199
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,250
Kroupa?

200
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,160
Supervisor.

201
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:45,427
I am here conditionally -

202
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:46,787
Pardon?

203
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:49,733
That I am here conditionaly,
it's decided this way.

204
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:52,502
If I have any difficulties
with the learning

205
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:54,623
I quit on the spot.

206
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:57,844
Yes?

207
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:00,969
You are entitled to it.

208
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,410
Mužik?

209
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,210
Rakouna!

210
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:05,615
Supervisor.

211
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:07,186
Thanks.

212
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:09,549
Pavlíček?

213
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:13,299
<i>Kroupa jr. is an ox.</i>

214
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:12,577
Planning.

215
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,953
Thank you.

216
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:15,572
Plha?

217
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:17,822
Warehouseman.

218
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,458
Roubiček.

219
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,109
I have a question.

220
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:22,436
Here...

221
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:25,448
in the school handbook
it's written that

222
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:28,313
„Always, the student must
go to school

223
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:30,499
properly kept.“

224
00:15:31,422 --> 00:15:32,620
Does it mean that

225
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,724
we have to shave every day?

226
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:36,036
Don't disturb.

227
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,136
But, no!

228
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:40,601
When I shave daily, I bleed.

229
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:47,271
So, you don't have to take thesе
rules litelally.

230
00:15:47,984 --> 00:15:49,554
It's about small children.

231
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,970
But children don't shave.

232
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:54,621
It's true.

233
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:58,458
But they have to be washed
and combed and such...

234
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,558
Roubiček.

235
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:03,234
And I have another question.

236
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:09,305
Here, in article 8, it says -
„The parents are being informed of

237
00:16:10,244 --> 00:16:12,042
the student's grades

238
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,053
at regular meetings.“

239
00:16:15,846 --> 00:16:18,453
Yes, it's also about kids.

240
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:23,164
Well, it's because my parents
live in Kojčice.

241
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:25,689
This is far away, near Pelhřimov,

242
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,604
and my parents are old, and...

243
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:29,704
But..

244
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,829
...it's a lot of travelling...

245
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,015
...as I said, Mr. Plha,

246
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:37,216
Don't torture your head with this,

247
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:39,985
it concerns little children.

248
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:41,312
Roubiček.

249
00:16:41,412 --> 00:16:42,412
That's why,

250
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:45,020
because I don't know otherwise.

251
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:47,513
The train is not for free, also.

252
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,472
Please, sit down at last.

253
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:51,722
But no, don't you understand?

254
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,438
I don't know about you, but

255
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:58,214
these 70 korunas for my parents, to travel...

256
00:16:58,314 --> 00:16:59,494


257
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:00,594
Roubiček

258
00:17:00,694 --> 00:17:01,694
Supervisor.

259
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:03,217
Supervisor at the mill.

260
00:17:03,317 --> 00:17:04,317
Thank you.

261
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:07,248
Šlajs?

262
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:10,600
Clerk.

263
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,348
Thank you.

264
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,534
Tuček.

265
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:18,775
Well?

266
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:21,188
And you work like a...?

267
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:25,269
Like a horse, Mr. Teacher.

268
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:29,734
Is the place free?

269
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:30,834
Certainly.

270
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:37,784
What's up George?

271
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:38,884
What?

272
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:39,984
What?

273
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:41,084
What what?

274
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:42,592
Come on, tell me!

275
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:43,692
What should I tell you?

276
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:46,931
What about school?
How is it going?

277
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:48,031
School?

278
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,638
Haven't you seen a school yet?

279
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:51,804
This is it..

280
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:54,686
It is interesting, they have all those things -

281
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:57,568
desks, a blackboard, a sponge.

282
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:59,608
And there are some models, that you can see

283
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:02,344
the structure of animals, stones...

284
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:03,898
What do you want to know more? What?

285
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:05,824
You know what I want to know, don't you?

286
00:18:05,924 --> 00:18:06,924
I know.

287
00:18:07,314 --> 00:18:08,755
Here, I would go there,

288
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:11,410
But I am there on a condition.
We clearly agreed on it -

289
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,510
And poor you,

290
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,610
poor you!

291
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:15,409
If it doesn't click.

292
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:16,509
Poor you!

293
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,171
Sit down, students!

294
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,256
Mareček, please hand me the pen.

295
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:44,744
I am Tuček, Mr. Professor.

296
00:18:44,844 --> 00:18:45,844
Yes.

297
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:51,317
Aluminum is still absent.

298
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:54,053
Aluminum moved to Humpolec.

299
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,207
It does not concern me
where he is.

300
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:58,878
Let him work it out with your class teacher.

301
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:02,100
I am marking him „absent“.

302
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:08,494
Thank you, Mareček.

303
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:19,439
I am professor Hrbolek.

304
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,013
I will teach you Czech.

305
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,247
And, if anybody is interested,

306
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:27,194
I can teach you private lessons in Latin.

307
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:30,707
And if somebody finds it difficult

308
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:33,750
to keep up with me in the Czech language course,

309
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:36,584
I offer private tuition as well.

310
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:38,235
Well, is anybody

311
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:39,967
interested?

312
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:42,687
I am retired, I have plenty of time.

313
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:44,792
Well, I am just substituting for

314
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,220
a colleague - Ptáček.

315
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,114
I have a question -

316
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:52,028
May I put Latin to use in my field?

317
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:53,809
And in what field do you plan to

318
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:55,736
dedicate yourself, student?

319
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,549
I keep the warehouse

320
00:19:58,002 --> 00:19:59,006
in the screw mill.

321
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:02,001
Even a warehouse keeper could read

322
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:05,077
the original texts of Vergil.

323
00:20:05,547 --> 00:20:07,538
So, I write you down.

324
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:08,638
But,

325
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:11,116
What is your name?

326
00:20:11,216 --> 00:20:12,216
Plha.

327
00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:16,718
I have not yet decided, for sure...

328
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:18,385
You will come

329
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:21,979
every Wednesday at 14:00, Mlha.

330
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,638
And now, we'll write a

331
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:29,281
little evaluative dictation.

332
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:32,745
So, prepare sheets of paper,

333
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:36,048
prepare your penholders, pens,

334
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:37,926
ink pots.

335
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:41,698
And we'll start dictating.

336
00:20:49,955 --> 00:21:01,498
„Fierce jackals howled grimly at the white moon“

337
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:05,157
Look here, only one mistake!

338
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:08,832
I thought that word „howled“ somehow
was connected to „owls“.

339
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:09,932


340
00:21:10,548 --> 00:21:13,236
„Fierce jackals owled grimly“

341
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:14,576
Otherwise, as you see

342
00:21:14,676 --> 00:21:16,215
without a single little mistake.

343
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,623
It could have been an Excellent.

344
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:19,566
Only this tiny mistake,
as you can see.

345
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:22,772
Only this tiny mistake.

346
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:24,892
On the other hand, Hujer,

347
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,013
what is this blob, at your age?

348
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:28,972
This is a shame!

349
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,250
For a little reality check,

350
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,540
I'll tell you something.

351
00:21:37,118 --> 00:21:41,099
What do you think did I get on the
evaluative dictation?

352
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:42,602
Good?

353
00:21:44,494 --> 00:21:45,494
Very good?

354
00:21:45,594 --> 00:21:46,594
Not even close.

355
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:49,931
I am familiar with it.

356
00:21:50,283 --> 00:21:51,589
May I reveal?

357
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:53,611
A total failure.

358
00:21:53,974 --> 00:21:55,280
That's it, sirs.

359
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,602
These were some crooked words,
weren't they?

360
00:21:57,702 --> 00:21:58,702
Please.

361
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,888
An ordinary dictation from my

362
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:01,988
mother tongue - Czech and

363
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:03,088
flunked.

364
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:06,320
You see that I have come a long way

365
00:22:06,444 --> 00:22:07,719
that I have patience,

366
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:09,637
but if it goes on the same way

367
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:11,575
we'll have a serious conversation.

368
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,784
Tell me

369
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:19,506
what are the disadvantages of the
steam engine?

370
00:22:20,636 --> 00:22:24,088
A disadvantage of the steam engine is its

371
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:26,389
great weight.

372
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:27,489
We'll say „mass“.

373
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,842
Its great weight..mass, and

374
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:36,029
low efficiency.

375
00:22:36,372 --> 00:22:38,714
How low is this efficiency?

376
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,662
Look, I don't like this,

377
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,901
I'll answer or I'll tell that
I don't know.

378
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:54,001
Don't be silent like a

379
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:55,101
ghost.

380
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:56,201
What is your name?

381
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,001
Ghost.

382
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,111
With such a name, you have
some right, but

383
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:02,832
please, learn it.

384
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:04,428
between 5%  and 10 %.

385
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:05,869
Let's summarize -

386
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,595
The historical significance of
the steam engine.

387
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:09,695
Svátek.

388
00:23:12,752 --> 00:23:14,183
The... the steam engine

389
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:17,738
was invented in the 18th century...

390
00:23:17,838 --> 00:23:18,838
Yes, please.

391
00:23:20,454 --> 00:23:21,999
The steam engine

392
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:24,083
invented in the 18th century

393
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:25,183
Continue.

394
00:23:25,596 --> 00:23:27,441
Šlajs is raising a hand, please.

395
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:28,779
Please,

396
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:30,883
he's ashamed to tell you.

397
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:31,983
Can you disclose

398
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,986
what is so delicate about
the steam engine?

399
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:37,030
He's ashamed to say that
he must walk.

400
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:38,367
Walk?

401
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:39,467
And where?

402
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:41,000
Nowhere. Just walking.

403
00:23:42,027 --> 00:23:44,483
Svátek is accustomed to walking
while thinking.

404
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:46,412
If he doesn't walk he
won't be able to think.

405
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:47,904
Look, Tuček.

406
00:23:48,215 --> 00:23:49,615
I already know about
your bright ideas.

407
00:23:49,715 --> 00:23:52,061
But he can do it, please.

408
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:53,544
I work in sales

409
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:55,078
and when I dictate letters

410
00:23:55,178 --> 00:23:56,178
I must walk.

411
00:23:57,421 --> 00:23:58,654
OK, then. Get out on the aisle

412
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:01,225
and walk, if it would help you.

413
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:02,852
The steam engine

414
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,423
was invented in the 18th century

415
00:24:05,817 --> 00:24:07,725
and was developed fundamentally

416
00:24:07,932 --> 00:24:09,331
in the 19th century.

417
00:24:10,171 --> 00:24:11,436
That is why

418
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,611
we call the 19th century

419
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:13,737
„The steam century“

420
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:21,854
Jarda!

421
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:25,368
Jarda!

422
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:27,203
Jarda!

423
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:29,877
The phone is ringing.

424
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,536
The phone is ringing.

425
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:33,112
Thanks!

426
00:24:38,471 --> 00:24:40,067
Hello, here is the gate.

427
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:41,747
Here is the rail station.

428
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:42,847
Gate,

429
00:24:43,571 --> 00:24:44,991
The monkey house has arrived.

430
00:24:45,914 --> 00:24:48,080
Is it that thing behind you?

431
00:24:49,631 --> 00:24:50,631
Has it arrived already?

432
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:53,315
Yeah. You have it on the third track.

433
00:25:01,961 --> 00:25:03,236
How wide is it?

434
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,481
How... how wide is it, they ask?

435
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:09,010
About... 3 meters (10 ft.)

436
00:25:10,368 --> 00:25:14,089
Most important, I don't want it
to stink here for too long.

437
00:25:16,142 --> 00:25:17,489
Everybody, come and see!

438
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:18,589
It has been delivered!

439
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,000
It will be warm inside.

440
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:06,415
It has a lot of control units.

441
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:07,515
What is this?

442
00:26:07,615 --> 00:26:10,579
This is the cockpit of the supervisor

443
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,471
and an executive armchair.

444
00:26:16,982 --> 00:26:17,982
Hujer, the forwarders are waiting for
the stacks!

445
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,081
I am on my way already!

446
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:23,375
Running!

447
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:28,488
You must also have a look
they have installed an armchair.

448
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:31,481
Hujer, today you also
wandered about the gate!

449
00:26:31,816 --> 00:26:33,435
I know, I know, but

450
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:35,188
the paper!

451
00:27:57,788 --> 00:28:00,509
Stop, Franta! Stop!

452
00:28:05,382 --> 00:28:06,650
Famfula!

453
00:28:08,207 --> 00:28:09,207
Famfula!

454
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:10,307
How does it run?

455
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:12,400
It runs wonderfully, but

456
00:28:13,338 --> 00:28:14,733
it doesn't sow.

457
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:23,018
It's quite a substantial problem
for a drill, no?

458
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:24,666
Did you look under?

459
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:25,766
No

460
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:27,864
You had to bend a little, eh?

461
00:28:30,387 --> 00:28:32,453
There is stuck paint under.

462
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,394
Mareček, hand me the pen.

463
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:42,122
I am Tuček, Mr. Professor.

464
00:28:42,635 --> 00:28:44,087
Yes. Yes.

465
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:47,961
And as I see it, Aluminum is still absent.

466
00:28:48,386 --> 00:28:50,451
Aluminum moved to Humpolec.

467
00:28:50,853 --> 00:28:52,271
Yes. Yes,

468
00:28:52,371 --> 00:28:54,515
but he is absent.

469
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,624
Thank you, Mareček.

470
00:29:02,856 --> 00:29:04,531
So what did we

471
00:29:04,631 --> 00:29:05,631
study

472
00:29:05,815 --> 00:29:07,947
last time?

473
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,415
Mlha?

474
00:29:11,565 --> 00:29:13,641
Last time we studied

475
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:15,774
one of the great poets

476
00:29:15,874 --> 00:29:16,874
of „the steam century“

477
00:29:17,974 --> 00:29:19,112
Jan Neruda.

478
00:29:20,073 --> 00:29:21,770
The steam century?

479
00:29:22,478 --> 00:29:23,478
Yes

480
00:29:24,706 --> 00:29:26,649
19th century is called

481
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:28,179
„The steam century“.

482
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,222
We studied it in physics.

483
00:29:30,758 --> 00:29:32,042
Well, all right.

484
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:33,404
All right.

485
00:29:34,476 --> 00:29:37,234
But don't say it in my classes.

486
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,398
We shall keep to the standard name -

487
00:29:41,622 --> 00:29:44,435
The 19th century.

488
00:29:47,316 --> 00:29:50,275
And what did we have for homework, eh?

489
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:56,471
So?

490
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:03,126
That I didn't give you any homework?!

491
00:30:04,097 --> 00:30:05,158
No, Mr. Professor,

492
00:30:05,258 --> 00:30:08,117
you said that, above all, we had to
get a good rest.

493
00:30:08,217 --> 00:30:11,053
It doesn't sound like me.

494
00:30:12,047 --> 00:30:13,119
Please.

495
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:16,446
We had to learn a poem by heart.

496
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,914
„Like lions beating against bars“

497
00:30:19,014 --> 00:30:20,014
Yes.

498
00:30:20,114 --> 00:30:23,637
Thank you that you reminded me.

499
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:26,930
Kroupa.

500
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,560
Come on, Kroupa.

501
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,660
Come here.

502
00:30:30,816 --> 00:30:32,848
You had problems with the
dictation

503
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:35,684
You may compensate with
reciting.

504
00:30:36,108 --> 00:30:37,705
And no mumbling,

505
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:40,753
let those verses flow.

506
00:30:42,104 --> 00:30:43,232
Jan Neruda,

507
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,186
from Cosmic Songs.

508
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:49,216
„ Like lions beating against bars,

509
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:52,811
like lions, captured in a cage,

510
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,088
we yarn to fly up to the heavens,

511
00:30:57,858 --> 00:30:58,997
yet we are...“

512
00:31:00,214 --> 00:31:01,755
„earthbound“

513
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,333
„earthbound“

514
00:31:12,758 --> 00:31:16,527
„We seem to hear a voice from stars:“,
please!

515
00:31:17,196 --> 00:31:20,401
„We seem to hear a voice from stars:“

516
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,505
“Come, you men, closer,

517
00:31:24,063 --> 00:31:25,939
Just a bit closer..“

518
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,039
„a bit closer“, eer

519
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,539
„Just a bit closer, you hubristic beings,“

520
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,990
please

521
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,748
„Whose feet are stone-bound!”

522
00:31:36,635 --> 00:31:37,635
„We come!“

523
00:31:38,282 --> 00:31:39,823
„Forgive us, dear Mother.“

524
00:31:41,062 --> 00:31:42,782
„The Earth is too confined for us.“

525
00:31:42,882 --> 00:31:43,882
„Shine - “

526
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:47,270
„we'll add it to the thought“

527
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:50,218
„and our legs“

528
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,697
„will march, steam powered“

529
00:31:53,154 --> 00:31:54,439
The steam century!

530
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,890
I said it...

531
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:57,152
Don't disturb!

532
00:31:58,056 --> 00:31:59,184
We'll come!

533
00:32:00,026 --> 00:32:01,026
We'll come!

534
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:02,935
We

535
00:32:03,856 --> 00:32:04,856
shall come.

536
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,920
We hear, we hear you coming,

537
00:32:09,478 --> 00:32:11,019
but what next?

538
00:32:11,868 --> 00:32:13,085
I don't know it after that.

539
00:32:13,185 --> 00:32:16,043
What would I do with you, boy?

540
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:18,991
You didn't make me happy and

541
00:32:19,091 --> 00:32:22,195
I won't make you happy too.

542
00:32:22,295 --> 00:32:24,897
Sit down.

543
00:32:25,478 --> 00:32:29,341
For the next time, you'll have to make
an analysis of this poem.

544
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:32,814
And now, a prosaic work of
Neruda.

545
00:32:32,914 --> 00:32:33,914
Please.

546
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,141
What do you want?

547
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,553
Please, Mr. Professor,

548
00:32:38,653 --> 00:32:39,803
let's sing.

549
00:32:39,903 --> 00:32:40,903
Let's sing!
Please!

550
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:42,003
What!?

551
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:44,102
We don't have a music class

552
00:32:44,202 --> 00:32:45,202
and in other classes,
like chemistry

553
00:32:45,302 --> 00:32:47,462
It does not fit in.

554
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,444
But we'll be delayed too much.
I wanted to...

555
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:53,168
I wanted to bridge the gaps!

556
00:32:53,447 --> 00:32:54,731
It is raining!

557
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:55,831
What?

558
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,639
Let's sing „It is Raining“!

559
00:32:59,219 --> 00:33:01,587
All right, but quickly, please.

560
00:33:01,687 --> 00:33:04,891
It is raining, let it pour.

561
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:07,940
<i>Where shall we go, dear horses?</i>

562
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,809
<i>We shall ride to the meadows,</i>

563
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:13,891
<i>until the cockoo starts to sing.</i>

564
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:15,878
This would be quite enough.

565
00:33:16,247 --> 00:33:18,625
<i>We shall ride to the meadows,</i>

566
00:33:18,993 --> 00:33:21,695
<i>until the cockoo starts to sing.</i>

567
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:25,045
So, the prosaic Neruda

568
00:33:25,246 --> 00:33:27,770
<i>Then the cuckoo started singing,</i>

569
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,940
<i>and my girl started crying.</i>

570
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,676
<i>Please, cuckoo, don't you sing,</i>

571
00:33:33,776 --> 00:33:36,757
<i>and my darling, don't you cry.</i>

572
00:33:37,863 --> 00:33:39,671
<i>Please, cuckoo, don't you sing,</i>

573
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:42,976
<i>and my darling, don't you cry.</i>

574
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:55,274
Don't you smoke?

575
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:56,374
Ugh, no.

576
00:33:58,657 --> 00:33:59,718
I am a non-smoker.

577
00:34:00,153 --> 00:34:01,326
This is good.

578
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:03,157
Do you know what I said to myself

579
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:04,257
when you recited?

580
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:05,357
What?

581
00:34:06,384 --> 00:34:07,522
No, really.

582
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:08,622
You have the feeling.

583
00:34:11,274 --> 00:34:14,155
There is so much feeling
in the first verses.

584
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:15,762
No, really.

585
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:17,940
You have a good presentation,

586
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,173
but you need someone to
study together.

587
00:34:20,273 --> 00:34:21,273
Mrs. Týfová!

588
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:22,373
You know what?
Let's try it together.

589
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:24,567
Yes?

590
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,515
Let's stay a bit more
after school

591
00:34:26,615 --> 00:34:30,501
and I guarantee you that tomorrow
you will know it excellently.

592
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:31,785
You are very kind,

593
00:34:32,979 --> 00:34:34,219
But I cannot today,

594
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:36,005
it's a mad house around me,

595
00:34:36,105 --> 00:34:38,104
dinner, wife.

596
00:34:38,796 --> 00:34:41,498
Icecream!
With nuts!

597
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:42,844
Acid!

598
00:34:42,944 --> 00:34:43,944
Sulfuric!

599
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,188
Caustics!

600
00:34:46,288 --> 00:34:47,288
Boron!

601
00:34:47,388 --> 00:34:48,388
Buy yourself!

602
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,107
Think about it.

603
00:34:50,207 --> 00:34:51,207
It's on sale.

604
00:34:53,311 --> 00:34:54,740
And then, on page 46

605
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,795
solve example 7a,

606
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:57,895
b, c,

607
00:34:58,648 --> 00:35:00,457
and on page 32,

608
00:35:00,797 --> 00:35:01,797
examples

609
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:03,561
d, e,

610
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:04,733
f

611
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:06,788
This is your homework
for the next time.

612
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:08,675
You may go.

613
00:35:10,506 --> 00:35:12,169
Kroupa will stay a second.

614
00:35:15,669 --> 00:35:16,669
Listen, Kroupa,

615
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,047
math is giving your dad
a hard time.

616
00:35:19,304 --> 00:35:20,304
Do you learn with him together?

617
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,409
No.

618
00:35:21,509 --> 00:35:22,509
Isn't it possible?

619
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:24,764
To lend a hand about it?

620
00:35:24,864 --> 00:35:25,864
Well...

621
00:35:25,964 --> 00:35:26,964
It's hard.

622
00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:29,252
At least the equations,

623
00:35:29,352 --> 00:35:30,352
he would need some
explanation.

624
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:31,452
He doesn't know basic things -

625
00:35:31,552 --> 00:35:34,076
removing brackets, fractions and etc.

626
00:35:34,511 --> 00:35:35,963
Yes, but he won't allow me to explain

627
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:37,063
anything.

628
00:35:37,163 --> 00:35:38,163
It's hard.

629
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:49,263
Please, Mommy!

630
00:36:01,665 --> 00:36:02,963
Oh-ho, tomato sauce.

631
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:08,398
Are you home?

632
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,530
How is school?

633
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:12,317
Normal. And you?

634
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:13,969
Did you get any grades?

635
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:15,566
No. And you?

636
00:36:16,124 --> 00:36:17,553
What about me?
None of your business.

637
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:18,971
What about me.

638
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:20,077
It's about you.

639
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:25,771
I go to this school, and

640
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:29,120
I am immersed in the problematics

641
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,220
Damn!

642
00:36:31,577 --> 00:36:34,882
So I can examine you a bit.

643
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,802
Did you learn equations?

644
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:37,902
Yeah, we did.

645
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:40,141
Great, excellent,

646
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,496
I would give you

647
00:36:42,596 --> 00:36:43,596
immediately

648
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:45,131
such an example

649
00:36:45,231 --> 00:36:53,986
2a-(3b-5a)=a+b

650
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,246
Dad, you must first remove
the brackets

651
00:36:57,346 --> 00:36:58,753
and then you will

652
00:36:58,853 --> 00:37:01,578
I know what I will do.
But I am interested

653
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,990
if you can do it too, well?

654
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:07,607
I would, at first, remove the brackets.

655
00:37:09,387 --> 00:37:10,387
Right.

656
00:37:11,616 --> 00:37:12,754
And how?

657
00:37:13,502 --> 00:37:14,708
You will..

658
00:37:14,808 --> 00:37:15,808
I mean

659
00:37:15,908 --> 00:37:16,908
I will do it in this way

660
00:37:17,243 --> 00:37:19,822
I will imagine minus one before the brackets

661
00:37:19,922 --> 00:37:22,959
and I will multiply all the numbers in the
brackets with it.

662
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:26,253
Wait, wait, don't brag so much about it

663
00:37:26,566 --> 00:37:28,308
How did you do it?
Multiplying?

664
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:31,601
If I wouldn't get it with that -1

665
00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:32,863
Then I will remember

666
00:37:32,963 --> 00:37:34,906
that when there is a minus
before the brackets,

667
00:37:35,006 --> 00:37:36,804
then all the signs in the brackets

668
00:37:37,061 --> 00:37:38,680
will change into their opposites.

669
00:37:39,194 --> 00:37:40,645
Oh! But, look

670
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:43,827
before 3b there is no sign

671
00:37:44,051 --> 00:37:46,741
If there isn't one, then it's a +

672
00:37:47,025 --> 00:37:48,025
Ahaa!

673
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:51,275
And, in this case 2a - 3b

674
00:37:55,654 --> 00:37:56,723
and so on

675
00:37:56,823 --> 00:37:57,823
and later?

676
00:37:59,473 --> 00:38:01,367
and then you will move a+b

677
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:03,049
from the right to the left side.

678
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:06,582
And, how do you move from one
side to the other?

679
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,634
Do you examine me,
or I examine you?

680
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:09,734
You examine me.

681
00:38:10,284 --> 00:38:11,284
that's why

682
00:38:12,934 --> 00:38:13,934
See,

683
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,530
you are quite good with it.

684
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,867
But, don't  rest on your laurels.

685
00:38:25,076 --> 00:38:28,453
to be... why am I so stupid?

686
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:30,205
to be

687
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,129
yes

688
00:38:32,713 --> 00:38:35,207
„We jump against the bars“

689
00:38:35,307 --> 00:38:38,056
„you and us we'll smash them“

690
00:38:38,156 --> 00:38:41,875
„Against the bars we jump as lions“

691
00:38:42,174 --> 00:38:44,852
„and we will smash them definitely“

692
00:38:45,437 --> 00:38:48,400
„Against the bars we jump..“

693
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:51,264
Daddy, leave that alone!

694
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:52,789
It's 1:45 a.m.

695
00:40:25,114 --> 00:40:26,189
Outratová!

696
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:28,505
A short meeting of the studying commitee
in the afternoon.

697
00:40:28,605 --> 00:40:29,605
Yes.

698
00:40:49,761 --> 00:40:50,761
Špaňha!

699
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:53,154
A short meeting of the studying commitee
in the afternoon.

700
00:40:53,254 --> 00:40:54,254
Yeah!

701
00:40:54,354 --> 00:40:55,354
What's wrong with you?

702
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:56,454
With me? Everything!

703
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:57,554
I can't get sleep at nights.

704
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,837
You look all green to me.

705
00:41:09,582 --> 00:41:10,665
Karel.

706
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,612
A short meeting of the studying commitee
in the afternoon.

707
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,547
What's on the program, George?

708
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:18,929
Grades.

709
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,848
Is it that transport?

710
00:41:38,021 --> 00:41:39,603
Rousek!

711
00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:42,909
A short meeting of the studying commitee
in the afternoon.

712
00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:44,009
Comrade Kroupa!

713
00:41:44,647 --> 00:41:46,072
Come and see!

714
00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:49,463
Look at it!

715
00:41:49,944 --> 00:41:50,944
Look at it!

716
00:41:51,229 --> 00:41:52,497
In order that the supervisor

717
00:41:52,782 --> 00:41:54,108
should not get down for
every sheet of paper.

718
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,661
They put it here for him.

719
00:41:55,761 --> 00:41:56,761
It goes up.

720
00:41:57,439 --> 00:41:58,439
He signs it.

721
00:41:58,539 --> 00:41:59,539
And then it goes down.

722
00:42:00,348 --> 00:42:02,500
It's an internal telescopical transporter

723
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,796
of the factory mail!

724
00:42:07,629 --> 00:42:11,063
At first - information about
my success  in school.

725
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:12,416
At the dictation

726
00:42:12,516 --> 00:42:15,950
„Fierce jackals howled grimly“

727
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,050
we were the worst.

728
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,637
I compensated with reciting and Failed

729
00:42:20,737 --> 00:42:23,957
the poem - „As lions jump against the bars“

730
00:42:24,057 --> 00:42:25,057
Another failure.

731
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:27,605
And then it follows

732
00:42:27,705 --> 00:42:28,705
briefly:

733
00:42:29,941 --> 00:42:31,922
Equations with one unknown.
Failed.

734
00:42:32,022 --> 00:42:33,760
Discontinuous functions. Failed.

735
00:42:33,888 --> 00:42:34,888
Physics

736
00:42:34,988 --> 00:42:36,894
Levers in balance. Satisfactory.

737
00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:37,994
See!

738
00:42:38,094 --> 00:42:39,094
Leave it alone.

739
00:42:39,194 --> 00:42:40,998
What are the reasons for the crash...

740
00:42:41,098 --> 00:42:42,098
Wait, George.

741
00:42:42,198 --> 00:42:44,916
You cannot speak so definitively
about a crash.

742
00:42:45,172 --> 00:42:46,768
You have just begun.

743
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:48,891
Obviously.

744
00:42:49,262 --> 00:42:52,439
What are the reasons of the crash
of the New York Stock Exchange.

745
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:53,539
Failed.

746
00:42:53,963 --> 00:42:55,915
Presence of nitrogen in nature.

747
00:42:56,015 --> 00:42:57,015
Satisfactory.

748
00:42:57,115 --> 00:42:58,115
So

749
00:42:58,566 --> 00:42:59,834
and now tell me

750
00:43:00,005 --> 00:43:02,199
what do you plan
to do with it.

751
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:03,299
Look, George.

752
00:43:03,399 --> 00:43:06,202
Aren't you a bit passive in this school?

753
00:43:06,302 --> 00:43:07,302
My boy, for example

754
00:43:08,097 --> 00:43:10,448
is not an Einstein at all

755
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:12,457
but he is first to collect
recyclables.

756
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:15,791
And the teachers look at him
differently.

757
00:43:15,891 --> 00:43:19,980
It's possible that those wastes
would have their role,

758
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:21,619
but it's not important!

759
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,500
My grades are important!

760
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,600
Well,

761
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,700
I think that

762
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,800
we must accept

763
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:30,353
that those grades are not
the ones that we promised,

764
00:43:30,453 --> 00:43:31,749
but I would not perceive it

765
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:32,849
so dark.

766
00:43:34,741 --> 00:43:36,237
The general view of the situation

767
00:43:36,337 --> 00:43:38,118
as you sketched it

768
00:43:38,218 --> 00:43:40,839
is not rosy at all.

769
00:43:40,939 --> 00:43:41,939
Although

770
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:44,644
and we must not overlook it

771
00:43:45,114 --> 00:43:47,109
and I would not agree with you

772
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:50,571
there are some positive sprouts,

773
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,819
I mean that nice „Satisfactory“
from nitrogen

774
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,811
and those levers in balance, no?

775
00:43:56,997 --> 00:43:59,333
These are the first birds of spring.

776
00:43:59,747 --> 00:44:03,337
You let those birds fly at
your executive meetings.

777
00:44:03,693 --> 00:44:05,531
Here we must recognize

778
00:44:05,631 --> 00:44:06,631
that I go under!

779
00:44:07,127 --> 00:44:08,381
And I ask you

780
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:11,116
Isn't it the right moment that
I, on my own,

781
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:13,667
voluntarily and honourably

782
00:44:14,006 --> 00:44:15,006
quit school?

783
00:44:15,488 --> 00:44:16,488
Out of question.

784
00:44:16,673 --> 00:44:19,224
Bullshit, no way.

785
00:44:20,093 --> 00:44:21,190
As you wish.

786
00:44:21,403 --> 00:44:23,198
I warned you.

787
00:44:23,569 --> 00:44:24,962
So, we'll push this cart further.

788
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:26,562
Mr. Kroupa,

789
00:44:26,972 --> 00:44:29,095
I brought you the literary analysis,

790
00:44:29,465 --> 00:44:32,657
but there are things, that me and
my husband could not apprehend.

791
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:34,822
The first line is all clear.

792
00:44:35,065 --> 00:44:38,071
The poet compares man to
a lion in a cage.

793
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:40,294
„we yarn to fly up to the heavens“

794
00:44:40,394 --> 00:44:42,174
This means, as my husband says,

795
00:44:42,274 --> 00:44:44,668
that man would gladly fly to the stars,

796
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:46,919
but he is prevented from it

797
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:48,985
being earthbound.

798
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:51,250
Naturally, the Earth's gravity.

799
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:53,516
And here you can talk about

800
00:44:53,616 --> 00:44:56,066
people already flying to the stars.

801
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:57,166
Well!

802
00:44:57,266 --> 00:44:58,266
This is a bright idea!

803
00:44:58,366 --> 00:45:00,341
You'll hit it right at the heart,

804
00:45:00,441 --> 00:45:02,221
connecting it to present day.

805
00:45:02,663 --> 00:45:04,244
And then, there are these
hubristics,

806
00:45:04,344 --> 00:45:05,940
and we couldn't grasp it.

807
00:45:06,482 --> 00:45:08,861
„Just a bit closer, you hubristic beings“

808
00:45:10,129 --> 00:45:12,024
Does somebody know what are hubristics?

809
00:45:12,451 --> 00:45:13,549
A hubristic?

810
00:45:14,176 --> 00:45:15,957
A hubristic is a beetle.

811
00:45:16,057 --> 00:45:17,057
A beetle?

812
00:45:17,478 --> 00:45:18,478
A beetle.

813
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:20,445
It's a bug, that it

814
00:45:21,297 --> 00:45:22,297
rolls this in front of it,

815
00:45:22,536 --> 00:45:23,536
a tiny ball

816
00:45:24,403 --> 00:45:25,403
of that -

817
00:45:25,845 --> 00:45:27,027
of droppings.

818
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,145
You mean a pooper?

819
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:32,245
Yes, a pooper, but

820
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:37,457
but in biology they call it „hubristic“.

821
00:45:43,512 --> 00:45:44,737
Five, failed.

822
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:46,390
How many dumplings do you want?

823
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:47,490
Five.

824
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:48,590
Five?

825
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:49,690
What?

826
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:50,790
Dumplings? Six.

827
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:53,030
Five, failed.

828
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:54,569
Five or six, at last?

829
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:57,091
Six dumplings.

830
00:45:57,191 --> 00:45:59,327
My father has a five. Flunked.

831
00:45:59,427 --> 00:46:00,638
Nonsense,

832
00:46:00,852 --> 00:46:02,918
you know that Father eats at the factory.

833
00:46:03,018 --> 00:46:04,018
Wait.

834
00:46:04,118 --> 00:46:07,406
This is his paper, I found it at school.

835
00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:09,130
This is horrible.

836
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,230
Look, here.

837
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:12,322
How's that possible that he
cannot calculate?

838
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,502
If he would allow me to explain, but no.

839
00:46:14,602 --> 00:46:15,602
Have a look!

840
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,106
the one he examined me with

841
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,030
and how does he transfer it?

842
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:22,110
-X, wow

843
00:46:22,537 --> 00:46:24,390
He is a bonehead.

844
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,057
It's too much for him.

845
00:46:26,342 --> 00:46:28,336
I am afraid that he will go crazy.

846
00:46:28,436 --> 00:46:30,374
In nighttime he beats his head
against the wardrobe.

847
00:46:30,474 --> 00:46:35,147
He shouts in sleep „We come! We come!“

848
00:46:35,247 --> 00:46:36,757
He shouldn't have gone to this school

849
00:46:36,857 --> 00:46:38,894
It's not for him.

850
00:46:38,994 --> 00:46:42,328
Come on, if some Hujer can do it.

851
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:55,607
Is this from you, Hujer?

852
00:46:55,832 --> 00:46:56,832
No

853
00:46:56,932 --> 00:46:58,257
I know nothing about it.

854
00:46:58,542 --> 00:46:59,939
I brought it.

855
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:01,392
It's recyclables.

856
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:02,831
What is it?

857
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,355
Old paper,

858
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:06,208
about 15 kg (33 lbs.)

859
00:47:08,373 --> 00:47:11,038
See, we did not count on it, that

860
00:47:11,138 --> 00:47:13,716
you would also join,
why not.

861
00:47:13,816 --> 00:47:15,554
If you are into it then

862
00:47:15,982 --> 00:47:17,848
but in this case it would
be necessary

863
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,199
to elect a team leader
for recyclables.

864
00:47:20,826 --> 00:47:22,878
Please, I would get involved.

865
00:47:22,978 --> 00:47:24,303
I would dedicate

866
00:47:24,687 --> 00:47:26,768
a separate notebook to it.

867
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,680
See?

868
00:47:32,937 --> 00:47:35,858
Dad won't raise a hand and won't raise a hand.

869
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:36,958
Hey, he already did raise it.

870
00:47:46,515 --> 00:47:48,809
He talks a lot.

871
00:47:49,194 --> 00:47:51,060
Hey, hey, do you see it?

872
00:47:51,231 --> 00:47:52,970
And he's stuck.

873
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,437
See how he scratches his nose?

874
00:47:54,651 --> 00:47:57,444
He does this when he's lost.

875
00:47:58,184 --> 00:47:59,809
The poet wants to express

876
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:03,029
that man is still small

877
00:48:03,257 --> 00:48:05,722
and compares him to hubristics.

878
00:48:06,306 --> 00:48:10,338
This is an unusual word, isn't it?

879
00:48:10,594 --> 00:48:11,635
So, what is it?

880
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:14,085
A hubristic is a

881
00:48:14,484 --> 00:48:15,709
beetle,

882
00:48:16,051 --> 00:48:17,547
dung roller,

883
00:48:18,189 --> 00:48:21,694
who rolls its small ball
between earth lumps.

884
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:27,820
First, we don't say „a hubristic“

885
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,701
but a „hubristic being“

886
00:48:31,226 --> 00:48:32,536
and then

887
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:39,646
your explanation of the word is
rather extravagant.

888
00:48:39,974 --> 00:48:43,037
Is there someone that thinks
the same way?

889
00:48:43,137 --> 00:48:45,901
Except Maleček and Hustoles.

890
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:50,061
See, Hustoles, we can't believe it.

891
00:48:50,646 --> 00:48:54,008
Well, is someone on the same opinion?

892
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,616
Yes. Great.

893
00:48:56,716 --> 00:49:00,007
Though, it's not quite right.

894
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:02,970
Does somebody know the true meaning

895
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:05,193
of „hubristic being“?

896
00:49:05,563 --> 00:49:06,589
Plha

897
00:49:06,689 --> 00:49:07,689
is raising a hand.

898
00:49:07,897 --> 00:49:08,997
Well?

899
00:49:09,097 --> 00:49:10,336
Mlha?

900
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,100
Please, I have a question.

901
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,200
Please I,

902
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:16,036
in this poem stumbled

903
00:49:16,178 --> 00:49:18,757
upon a word that I don't understand.

904
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,279
Which word?

905
00:49:21,379 --> 00:49:23,160
The word

906
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,260
„a hubristic“.

907
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,237
I have never heard it.

908
00:49:29,571 --> 00:49:31,053
But we are talking

909
00:49:31,153 --> 00:49:32,449
more than 15 min.

910
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:35,612
about it, Mlha.

911
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,334
They have it entertaining there.

912
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:39,730
Come.

913
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,696
We must go home.

914
00:49:41,867 --> 00:49:44,577
Hey, Hrbola takes out his notebook.

915
00:49:45,173 --> 00:49:46,583
Oh, yeah.

916
00:49:47,965 --> 00:49:50,473
I hear him already

917
00:49:51,841 --> 00:49:54,776
„What should I do with you, boy?“

918
00:49:55,132 --> 00:49:57,212
„You did not make me happy

919
00:49:57,312 --> 00:50:02,441
and I won't make you happy also.“

920
00:50:04,403 --> 00:50:06,569
What should I do with you, boy?

921
00:50:06,669 --> 00:50:08,721
You did not make me happy

922
00:50:08,821 --> 00:50:12,453
and I won't make you happy also.

923
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:16,742
Satisfactory.

924
00:50:17,127 --> 00:50:18,737
Good night, Kroupa!
Good night

925
00:50:18,848 --> 00:50:19,848
Mr. Kroupa.

926
00:50:19,948 --> 00:50:20,948
Yes, please.

927
00:50:22,755 --> 00:50:25,020
They gave us a hard time.

928
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,120
My God,

929
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,599
such a warm evening.

930
00:50:27,884 --> 00:50:29,451
It's quite wonderful for a walk.

931
00:50:29,551 --> 00:50:30,551
Yeah.

932
00:50:30,651 --> 00:50:31,651
Go for it.

933
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:32,751
I'll go home

934
00:50:32,851 --> 00:50:33,851
and open a window and a beer.

935
00:50:34,794 --> 00:50:36,290
Good night.

936
00:50:36,718 --> 00:50:37,886
George!

937
00:50:37,986 --> 00:50:38,986
George!

938
00:50:39,086 --> 00:50:40,086
What is it?

939
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:41,819
I

940
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,398
have to admit something to you.

941
00:50:44,498 --> 00:50:45,498
What?

942
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:47,461
I knew that „hubristic“

943
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:50,068
was not a poop beetle.

944
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,650
I said it

945
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,870
because I felt sorry for you.

946
00:50:55,354 --> 00:50:57,021
You were facing it so lonely.

947
00:50:57,121 --> 00:50:58,121
Whom?

948
00:50:59,614 --> 00:51:01,096
That beetle of yours.

949
00:51:01,196 --> 00:51:02,777
But this is not my beetle.

950
00:51:02,877 --> 00:51:04,943
Hora, that fool, gave me this advice.

951
00:51:05,242 --> 00:51:07,408
Nobody stood up for you.

952
00:51:07,878 --> 00:51:08,975
There was nobody

953
00:51:09,075 --> 00:51:11,355
that you could rely upon, and

954
00:51:11,455 --> 00:51:13,592
I rushed to help you.

955
00:51:13,805 --> 00:51:15,914
Look, Mrs Týfová, you are a
very sympathetic

956
00:51:16,014 --> 00:51:18,322
lady and I feel flattered

957
00:51:18,422 --> 00:51:20,587
by your interest in me, but

958
00:51:20,687 --> 00:51:21,687
don't you feel

959
00:51:22,098 --> 00:51:24,705
that we are not 20 anymore?

960
00:51:24,976 --> 00:51:26,899
You think that we are so old?

961
00:51:27,256 --> 00:51:30,832
Certainly not. But with distant
birthdays. Good night.

962
00:51:42,444 --> 00:51:44,980
The pooper beetle!

963
00:51:48,411 --> 00:51:49,411
Stop! You!

964
00:51:49,511 --> 00:51:50,511
You!

965
00:51:55,267 --> 00:51:56,906
Thank you frankly for the help.

966
00:51:57,248 --> 00:51:59,371
You cannot possibly imagine my success.

967
00:51:59,471 --> 00:52:00,781
With your knowledge.

968
00:52:00,881 --> 00:52:03,944
But I did think that it was a beetle, yes.

969
00:52:04,044 --> 00:52:06,780
And if you have another brilliant idea, share it.

970
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,826
I will brag about it at school.

971
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,368
We collected this from all around the offices.

972
00:52:16,696 --> 00:52:19,304
There is about 40 kg (18 lbs.)

973
00:52:19,731 --> 00:52:20,771
This is great!

974
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:21,871
Great help!

975
00:52:22,495 --> 00:52:25,273
The recyclables team leader with the highest quantity

976
00:52:25,373 --> 00:52:27,824
will be rewarded.

977
00:52:28,223 --> 00:52:29,990
Last time we

978
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,090
detected metal elements

979
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,190
in solutions.

980
00:52:33,837 --> 00:52:35,675
Please, pay attention.

981
00:52:36,629 --> 00:52:37,741
So,

982
00:52:39,835 --> 00:52:41,473
And now we'll test

983
00:52:41,573 --> 00:52:44,252
if there is sodium inside.

984
00:52:46,218 --> 00:52:47,301
Attention,

985
00:52:47,351 --> 00:52:51,051
<i>We'll meet at the cemetery.
G.K.</i>

986
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:51,922
The liquid is being coloured.

987
00:52:52,242 --> 00:52:53,242
Calm.

988
00:52:53,741 --> 00:52:55,023
Don't disturb.

989
00:52:57,531 --> 00:53:01,278
And we'll prepare another solution.

990
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:02,789
So,

991
00:53:11,665 --> 00:53:13,346
and, hm

992
00:53:16,951 --> 00:53:19,188
carefully,

993
00:53:19,288 --> 00:53:22,551
carefully, in this manner

994
00:53:26,982 --> 00:53:28,763
Silence. Don't disturb.

995
00:53:31,966 --> 00:53:32,966
What's your name?

996
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:34,291
Matula

997
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:35,445
What dou you carry?

998
00:53:35,986 --> 00:53:37,197
I don't know.

999
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,734
And now we'll detect

1000
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,170
the presence of potassium.

1001
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:44,706
Knock. Knock.

1002
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,040
Silence.

1003
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,140
Don't disturb.

1004
00:53:50,035 --> 00:53:51,346
Take!

1005
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,282
It is dissolving.

1006
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,545
What's with you today?

1007
00:54:02,645 --> 00:54:04,596
Please, comrade Professor,

1008
00:54:04,696 --> 00:54:06,192
there is a student from another class.

1009
00:54:06,677 --> 00:54:07,902
What?

1010
00:54:11,404 --> 00:54:12,404
Are you here a long time?

1011
00:54:12,504 --> 00:54:13,504
Aha.

1012
00:54:13,604 --> 00:54:14,604
What are you saying?

1013
00:54:14,704 --> 00:54:14,704
Are you here a long time?

1014
00:54:14,704 --> 00:54:15,704
Yes, please.

1015
00:54:16,579 --> 00:54:17,776
Let me see what you've got.

1016
00:54:21,877 --> 00:54:22,877
Who sent you with this?

1017
00:54:22,977 --> 00:54:24,757
The comrade Director.

1018
00:54:24,857 --> 00:54:26,538
And you have to give it to me?

1019
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,676
You have to write it on the blackboard.

1020
00:54:34,443 --> 00:54:36,170
Write down:

1021
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:39,920


1022
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:52,285
Thanks, bye.

1023
00:54:52,385 --> 00:54:53,385
Bye.

1024
00:54:55,635 --> 00:55:00,135
<i>A meeting with parents and friends
of the School, 20th 19:00 The Headmaster</i>

1025
00:55:00,304 --> 00:55:01,828
This should not be valid vor us, this

1026
00:55:01,928 --> 00:55:03,979
Why not? Just write it down.

1027
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,476
Everybody, write it down.

1028
00:55:05,576 --> 00:55:08,225
Kroupa, they must be out of their mind!

1029
00:55:08,325 --> 00:55:10,163
My parents are in Kojčice, this is

1030
00:55:10,263 --> 00:55:11,659
far away, at Pelhřimov.

1031
00:55:11,759 --> 00:55:13,055
Such a distance, and now

1032
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:15,406
travelling is not for free, too.

1033
00:55:15,506 --> 00:55:17,914
But it's totally logical.

1034
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,521
Our families must be informed

1035
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:23,186
of our progress in school.

1036
00:55:29,298 --> 00:55:32,005
Sit down.

1037
00:55:34,442 --> 00:55:36,123
Plha is raising a hand.

1038
00:55:36,223 --> 00:55:37,223
PLease, I have a question.

1039
00:55:37,505 --> 00:55:39,329
This message on the board,

1040
00:55:39,429 --> 00:55:41,309
about the parents' meeting,

1041
00:55:41,594 --> 00:55:43,831
is it valid for us?

1042
00:55:44,757 --> 00:55:46,823
The orders of the headmaster

1043
00:55:46,923 --> 00:55:48,989
are always valid.

1044
00:55:49,502 --> 00:55:50,699
But no,

1045
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,950
this is too much...

1046
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:57,666
Don't forget that at 50, one learns with
an effort.

1047
00:55:58,036 --> 00:55:59,518
It doesn't get so easy in the head.

1048
00:55:59,646 --> 00:56:01,869
I wouldn't criticize him for his difficulties.

1049
00:56:01,969 --> 00:56:03,522
You have troubles on your mind, don't you?

1050
00:56:03,622 --> 00:56:06,215
Something else is bothering me.

1051
00:56:06,315 --> 00:56:09,036
I promise myself, that if I am to have kids,

1052
00:56:09,136 --> 00:56:11,301
If we are going to have kids.

1053
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:12,968
If we are going to have kids.

1054
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,391
then I won't be ashamed to ask

1055
00:56:15,491 --> 00:56:16,491
Do you want twins?

1056
00:56:16,591 --> 00:56:17,591
Wait.

1057
00:56:18,568 --> 00:56:20,477
Shortly, if we were to have kids

1058
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:23,099
I won't ever be ashamed to ask

1059
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:24,199
Hey, Pete...

1060
00:56:24,299 --> 00:56:25,299
No, not Pete!

1061
00:56:27,231 --> 00:56:29,311
OK, then, hey Theophilus,

1062
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:31,177
I can't solve equations with two unknowns,

1063
00:56:31,277 --> 00:56:32,346
please explain.

1064
00:56:32,517 --> 00:56:33,517
And,

1065
00:56:33,617 --> 00:56:34,939
and he will explain.

1066
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:37,162
If this Theophilus is after me,

1067
00:56:37,262 --> 00:56:39,498
then he won't be able to.

1068
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:44,029
Two circles in a plain may have
two intersection points

1069
00:56:44,129 --> 00:56:46,722
one intersection point
or none at all.

1070
00:56:46,993 --> 00:56:48,346
In the first case,

1071
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:51,680
the sum of the radiuses is smaller
than the distance between centres.

1072
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,587
and the difference between radiuses
is smaller than the distance between centres.

1073
00:56:54,687 --> 00:56:56,254
In the second case,

1074
00:56:56,354 --> 00:57:00,500
the distance between the centres is
equal to the sum of the radiuses.

1075
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:01,870
In the third case...

1076
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:02,970
Listen to him.

1077
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:05,244
If for A, for A

1078
00:57:05,344 --> 00:57:08,179
if the sum of the radiuses

1079
00:57:08,279 --> 00:57:10,146
is smaller than the distance between the centres

1080
00:57:10,246 --> 00:57:14,021
And the difference of the radiuses is greater or equal to the

1081
00:57:14,121 --> 00:57:17,626
distance between the centres of the circles.

1082
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:21,444
In this case, one of the circles is situated
inside the other.

1083
00:57:21,544 --> 00:57:25,021
Basically it was right, except for a small inaccuracy.

1084
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:27,856
Come and draw it, so we can see it graphically.

1085
00:57:27,956 --> 00:57:28,956
Please.

1086
00:57:41,406 --> 00:57:43,059
What happened, who went out?

1087
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,911
Týfová was not feeling well.

1088
00:57:45,011 --> 00:57:47,760
Please, go and have a look.

1089
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:52,462
I am going.

1090
00:57:55,483 --> 00:57:56,808
What happened to you?

1091
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,108
Who sent you this?

1092
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:03,362
Kroupa.

1093
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:06,454
What a cynic.

1094
00:58:06,554 --> 00:58:09,432
Asshole.

1095
00:58:10,258 --> 00:58:12,680
Kroupa, lend me the drafting compass.

1096
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:13,792
I need it.

1097
00:58:14,262 --> 00:58:17,667
Come on, draw with a coin.

1098
00:58:19,277 --> 00:58:22,412
Don't you have your own?

1099
00:58:23,423 --> 00:58:27,213
Why don't you buy one?

1100
00:58:52,472 --> 00:58:53,472
I welcome you.

1101
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:55,068
I welcome you, comrades.

1102
00:58:55,168 --> 00:58:57,063
I welcome you.

1103
00:58:57,163 --> 00:58:58,163
Welcome

1104
00:58:59,627 --> 00:59:00,739
Welcome.

1105
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:03,118
You must have come to see

1106
00:59:03,218 --> 00:59:05,498
our factory?

1107
00:59:05,598 --> 00:59:07,051
Please, tell me

1108
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:08,988
what would be your interest in us.

1109
00:59:09,088 --> 00:59:10,088
So,

1110
00:59:10,188 --> 00:59:11,188
I am in charge here

1111
00:59:11,288 --> 00:59:12,288
in general

1112
00:59:13,377 --> 00:59:14,377
respectively

1113
00:59:14,477 --> 00:59:15,477
quite soon.

1114
00:59:15,577 --> 00:59:16,577
My name is Hujer,

1115
00:59:16,677 --> 00:59:17,677
Hujer

1116
00:59:18,603 --> 00:59:19,603
Well, so

1117
00:59:19,703 --> 00:59:21,555
Here, behind me, you see

1118
00:59:21,655 --> 00:59:22,655
this is the old workshop

1119
00:59:23,234 --> 00:59:24,234
and there

1120
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:25,858
we are building a new one

1121
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:27,468
entirely automatic

1122
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:29,335
and it will be, will be

1123
00:59:29,435 --> 00:59:31,514
the beating heart of our plant.

1124
00:59:31,614 --> 00:59:33,125
You have ecountered our

1125
00:59:33,225 --> 00:59:35,162
machines in the fields

1126
00:59:35,262 --> 00:59:36,772
and you didn't expect

1127
00:59:36,872 --> 00:59:37,872
that bolt by bolt,

1128
00:59:37,972 --> 00:59:39,180
the Holy Truth,

1129
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,280
was born here.

1130
00:59:42,127 --> 00:59:44,053
And there, it is the sprout

1131
00:59:44,435 --> 00:59:45,435
of the new one.

1132
00:59:47,643 --> 00:59:48,883
He was asking about you

1133
00:59:48,983 --> 00:59:50,692
What do you do, what obligations

1134
00:59:50,792 --> 00:59:51,792
How was his name, again?

1135
00:59:51,892 --> 00:59:53,642
Týfa, engineer Týfa.

1136
00:59:53,742 --> 00:59:56,847
I don't know Týfa.
I go with Týfová to school.

1137
00:59:57,118 --> 00:59:59,213
So dear friends, I welcome you

1138
00:59:59,313 --> 01:00:03,202
to our factory. [translation in
Romanian]

1139
01:00:03,672 --> 01:00:06,479
This is our deputy Director Kalivoda.

1140
01:00:09,557 --> 01:00:10,939
My name is Kroupa

1141
01:00:11,095 --> 01:00:13,617
and I am the supervisor.

1142
01:00:15,769 --> 01:00:17,208
Hujer, mind your job!

1143
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:27,706
Hi, Daddy.

1144
01:00:27,806 --> 01:00:28,806
Hi.

1145
01:00:28,906 --> 01:00:29,906
What's up?

1146
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,866
Did you do something to Mum?

1147
01:00:31,966 --> 01:00:34,004
Me? No. Why?

1148
01:00:34,104 --> 01:00:35,728
She behaves strangely.

1149
01:00:35,828 --> 01:00:38,335
Doesn't speak, just walks around

1150
01:00:48,722 --> 01:00:50,603
shines the mirrors and
disappears again.

1151
01:00:51,087 --> 01:00:52,441
Maybe she wants them clean.

1152
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:54,877
Come on, they are shiny like a...

1153
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:56,772
Didn't she say something before?

1154
01:00:56,872 --> 01:00:59,194
Nothing interesting. Although,

1155
01:01:09,196 --> 01:01:11,419
Somebody, engineer Týfa called

1156
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:12,772
and when she put down the phone,

1157
01:01:12,872 --> 01:01:14,767
she looked haunted.

1158
01:01:14,867 --> 01:01:17,631
Man, this doesn't

1159
01:01:28,075 --> 01:01:29,671
look good.

1160
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:33,532
It doesn't come

1161
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:40,488
by itself.

1162
01:01:40,588 --> 01:01:41,588
Did you ask her?

1163
01:01:42,024 --> 01:01:43,024
I asked, but

1164
01:01:43,124 --> 01:01:45,885
she would say the same -
nothing!

1165
01:01:52,054 --> 01:01:53,465
Mommy,

1166
01:01:53,565 --> 01:01:57,255
why do you shine those mirrors
all the time?

1167
01:01:57,611 --> 01:01:59,891
In order to see by yourself what
a prick you are.

1168
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,608
Oh, well,

1169
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:11,432
must we deal with such problems

1170
01:02:11,532 --> 01:02:13,782
even among grown ups.

1171
01:02:13,882 --> 01:02:16,176
If I am concerned, Mr. Director

1172
01:02:16,689 --> 01:02:18,299
I would throw it in the bin, but

1173
01:02:18,399 --> 01:02:20,137
the husband of Mrs. Týfová insists

1174
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,474
that we elaborate on this and
for Kroupa to apologize.

1175
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:24,770
Hi, Kroupa.

1176
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:26,235
Did they call you too?

1177
01:02:26,335 --> 01:02:27,335
No, where?

1178
01:02:27,435 --> 01:02:28,714
I am going to Latin.
Where did they call you?

1179
01:02:28,814 --> 01:02:29,814
To the Director.

1180
01:02:29,914 --> 01:02:30,914
What do they want?

1181
01:02:31,014 --> 01:02:32,960
About those poor grades in math

1182
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,653
they will suggest that I leave school.

1183
01:02:35,796 --> 01:02:37,619
And I'll say to Hrbolek

1184
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:39,016
that Latin is not for me.

1185
01:02:39,116 --> 01:02:40,512
„laudo, laudare“

1186
01:02:40,612 --> 01:02:43,091
What to do with this
at the drill mill.

1187
01:02:43,191 --> 01:02:45,100
I cannot imagine at all

1188
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,405
how should we discuss it with him

1189
01:02:49,115 --> 01:02:50,428
Enter!

1190
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:52,110
Good afternoon

1191
01:02:53,306 --> 01:02:54,347
I am Kroupa

1192
01:02:54,447 --> 01:02:56,370
They told me that I come here.

1193
01:02:56,612 --> 01:02:58,279
Sit down, comrade Kroupa.

1194
01:02:58,379 --> 01:02:59,379
Thank you.

1195
01:03:09,803 --> 01:03:10,803
Listen, I don't know

1196
01:03:10,903 --> 01:03:13,165
if you are aware of the reason
why you have been invited

1197
01:03:13,265 --> 01:03:14,265
Well,

1198
01:03:14,835 --> 01:03:17,186
I can guess.

1199
01:03:17,899 --> 01:03:20,805
So, it would be easier to talk about it.

1200
01:03:21,703 --> 01:03:25,122
I certainly don't think that you have planned it

1201
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:28,271
I did not plan anything, I was

1202
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:31,420
I was persuaded to do it.

1203
01:03:31,705 --> 01:03:33,956
Who persuaded you?

1204
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,352
Hora,

1205
01:03:35,452 --> 01:03:37,347
Outratová, Rousek

1206
01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:38,758
Write down those names!

1207
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:41,422
You cannot possibly know them, they are from the factory

1208
01:03:41,522 --> 01:03:44,300
and I would appreciate if they don't get trouble from this.

1209
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,323
They had good intentions.

1210
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:47,848
I also think that it was rather a

1211
01:03:47,948 --> 01:03:50,683
misunderstanding, than

1212
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,783
Well,

1213
01:03:51,883 --> 01:03:53,732
I told them immediately,

1214
01:03:53,832 --> 01:03:56,582
that it doesn't make sense.

1215
01:03:56,682 --> 01:03:59,318
And I am ready to drop it immediately.

1216
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:02,680
We consider it obvious,
that you won't repeat it ever.

1217
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:05,401
And it would be necessary
for you to apologize.

1218
01:04:05,501 --> 01:04:07,496
It's enough that I go away, what

1219
01:04:07,596 --> 01:04:09,320
apology do you need?

1220
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,514
If I have insulted you personally,

1221
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:13,053
because I've been here, please

1222
01:04:13,153 --> 01:04:16,387
accept my deepest apologies.

1223
01:04:16,487 --> 01:04:17,997
Wait, comrade Kroupa.

1224
01:04:18,097 --> 01:04:19,097
We don't understand each other.

1225
01:04:19,197 --> 01:04:21,701
Nobody wants from you to quit school.

1226
01:04:21,801 --> 01:04:23,610
But the lady comrade was clear about it.

1227
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:25,833
It's only about dealing with

1228
01:04:26,275 --> 01:04:28,170
the note to Mrs. Týfová

1229
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:30,834
with some tact.

1230
01:04:31,532 --> 01:04:33,114
Yes. Exactly.

1231
01:04:40,181 --> 01:04:41,805
We are maybe the same age

1232
01:04:41,905 --> 01:04:42,905
aren't we?

1233
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:45,481
Isn't it a bit boyish at our age.

1234
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:48,003
This comrade husband, this Tyfa,

1235
01:04:48,103 --> 01:04:50,211
he rightfully considers it an insult.

1236
01:04:50,311 --> 01:04:52,805
First, you tell her in the eye that she's old,

1237
01:04:52,905 --> 01:04:53,905
and later write to her

1238
01:04:54,005 --> 01:04:55,005
„We'll meet at the cemetery.“

1239
01:04:56,538 --> 01:04:58,661
It is cynical.

1240
01:04:59,686 --> 01:05:00,997
Look,

1241
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:03,434
the International Day of Women is approaching.

1242
01:05:03,818 --> 01:05:06,212
You gave her a nice gift.

1243
01:05:06,497 --> 01:05:07,580
This piece of paper

1244
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,831
I see for the first time in my life.

1245
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:11,811
You cannot talk?

1246
01:05:11,911 --> 01:05:13,949
You must write letters to each other?

1247
01:05:14,049 --> 01:05:15,929
„At the cemetery“!

1248
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:17,283
Such,

1249
01:05:17,383 --> 01:05:19,121
such shame!

1250
01:05:20,218 --> 01:05:22,455
And I have to run around and explain!

1251
01:05:22,555 --> 01:05:24,863
As if I don't have worries of my own.

1252
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:25,963
Please, don't shout.

1253
01:05:26,658 --> 01:05:27,658
Good afternoon.

1254
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:28,758
Hi.

1255
01:05:29,821 --> 01:05:31,787
They called me to the Headmaster's office

1256
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:32,887
investigating

1257
01:05:33,226 --> 01:05:34,637
as if I were some kind of a rascal.

1258
01:05:34,765 --> 01:05:36,076
Wait, it's here somewhere.

1259
01:05:36,176 --> 01:05:38,242
Hey, 84

1260
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:45,679
Ring.

1261
01:05:49,637 --> 01:05:50,637
Emil!

1262
01:05:51,133 --> 01:05:52,148
The bell!

1263
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:54,214
Open!

1264
01:05:55,325 --> 01:05:56,379
What is it, darling?

1265
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,231
Don't you see that I am in the sauna?

1266
01:05:58,402 --> 01:06:00,625
I am studying!

1267
01:06:10,539 --> 01:06:11,907
Eh, do you see?

1268
01:06:12,178 --> 01:06:13,773
„A happy home“

1269
01:06:14,115 --> 01:06:16,481
And you nearly destroyed it.

1270
01:06:23,576 --> 01:06:24,944
Oh, my God!

1271
01:06:27,281 --> 01:06:28,663
He's naked!

1272
01:06:28,763 --> 01:06:30,629
Poor Mrs. Týfová.

1273
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:32,139
Are you looking for someone?

1274
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:33,592
I am Kroupa.

1275
01:06:33,692 --> 01:06:34,692
Aha.

1276
01:06:35,573 --> 01:06:37,397
A fellow student of your wife.

1277
01:06:37,753 --> 01:06:38,978
And this is my son

1278
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,887
who came here to explain something.

1279
01:06:40,987 --> 01:06:41,987
Aha.

1280
01:06:42,087 --> 01:06:43,087
Aha.

1281
01:06:43,979 --> 01:06:49,251
Please. Obviously. I'll open the door.

1282
01:06:49,636 --> 01:06:50,947
Come inside.

1283
01:06:52,386 --> 01:06:54,936
It's not necessary. We'll do it quickly.

1284
01:06:55,221 --> 01:06:57,159
It would be more appropriate,

1285
01:06:57,259 --> 01:06:59,453
if I understand it well,

1286
01:06:59,553 --> 01:07:01,690
if it's about that

1287
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:02,958
apology,

1288
01:07:03,058 --> 01:07:05,437
that my wife would be

1289
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:07,033
present too.

1290
01:07:07,631 --> 01:07:10,851
It's not an apology, but an explanation.

1291
01:07:10,951 --> 01:07:11,951
What is your name?

1292
01:07:12,051 --> 01:07:13,051
George Kroupa.

1293
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:15,439
Pay attention, please, that he has
the same initials as me:

1294
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:16,539
G.K.

1295
01:07:17,248 --> 01:07:19,044
Whom did you write that note to?

1296
01:07:19,144 --> 01:07:20,144
A girl from our class.

1297
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:21,244
What is her name?

1298
01:07:21,962 --> 01:07:22,962
Eva Tůmová.

1299
01:07:23,062 --> 01:07:25,070
Take into account, please -
„Eva. T.“

1300
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,792
What did you write in that note?

1301
01:07:28,162 --> 01:07:29,829
We'll meet at the cemetery.

1302
01:07:30,114 --> 01:07:32,465
Did you intend to suggest that she is old,

1303
01:07:32,565 --> 01:07:33,565
about to die?

1304
01:07:34,073 --> 01:07:35,073
No.

1305
01:07:35,173 --> 01:07:36,711
What did you think about?

1306
01:07:36,811 --> 01:07:37,979
Well, that,

1307
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:39,079
to come to the cemetery.

1308
01:07:39,518 --> 01:07:41,399
We usually meet there.

1309
01:07:41,499 --> 01:07:43,593
Pay attention, please, that my
son is dating a girl schoolmate

1310
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:45,687
at the cemetery, among the graves.

1311
01:07:45,987 --> 01:07:47,910
So, if I understand it well,

1312
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:49,862
Yes, you understand it quite well -

1313
01:07:49,962 --> 01:07:52,341
I did not write that note at all and it
was not addressed to your wife,

1314
01:07:52,469 --> 01:07:54,521
whom I greet from my heart.
It was a pleasure.

1315
01:07:54,621 --> 01:07:55,621
I was honoured. Come.

1316
01:08:07,686 --> 01:08:09,239
Týfa took it with dignity,

1317
01:08:09,536 --> 01:08:10,536
as Cicero,

1318
01:08:10,636 --> 01:08:11,636
nearly naked.

1319
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:14,468
George explained everything.

1320
01:08:14,568 --> 01:08:18,344
and now everything is in
ultimate order.

1321
01:08:18,572 --> 01:08:20,139
Wait, now I see

1322
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:21,239
you have a girlfriend!

1323
01:08:21,721 --> 01:08:22,846
Yes, I have.

1324
01:08:22,946 --> 01:08:23,946
And how old are you?

1325
01:08:25,052 --> 01:08:26,052
You, boy!

1326
01:08:26,152 --> 01:08:27,520
When I was as old as you are...

1327
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,215
But, Daddy.

1328
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:32,692
I did not finish. What?

1329
01:08:33,347 --> 01:08:35,142
When I was old as you are now,

1330
01:08:35,555 --> 01:08:37,750
I also did have, naturally, a girlfriend.

1331
01:08:49,316 --> 01:08:50,886
I have to go.

1332
01:08:52,881 --> 01:08:55,018
It's high time.

1333
01:08:57,911 --> 01:08:59,777
Mom, is this brown sweater OK?

1334
01:08:59,877 --> 01:09:00,877
Yes.

1335
01:09:00,977 --> 01:09:02,712
So, you also are going out?

1336
01:09:02,897 --> 01:09:05,291
We go to parents meeting.

1337
01:09:05,775 --> 01:09:07,656
It's enough that I'll be there, no?

1338
01:09:07,756 --> 01:09:10,135
We are going to ask about you, Daddy.

1339
01:09:10,235 --> 01:09:12,187
I spoke to Mrs. Tuček and to Mrs. Šlajs.

1340
01:09:12,287 --> 01:09:13,669
Everybody is coming.

1341
01:09:13,769 --> 01:09:15,108
Please, this is

1342
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:16,547
completely unnecessary,

1343
01:09:16,647 --> 01:09:18,285
I tell everything at home.

1344
01:09:18,527 --> 01:09:20,080
Come on, we'll do it gladly.

1345
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,990
We don't need the school to tell us

1346
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:23,529
that we are not interested in you.

1347
01:09:23,629 --> 01:09:24,868
What are you saying?

1348
01:09:24,968 --> 01:09:27,860
They won't let you in, look,

1349
01:09:28,285 --> 01:09:29,285
Here

1350
01:09:30,254 --> 01:09:33,060
„A parents and friends of the school meeting“

1351
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:34,870
Are you some parent?

1352
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:37,705
I am a friend of the school.

1353
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:40,412
He'll solve the example, but

1354
01:09:40,512 --> 01:09:43,333
often will make a simple mistake from haste.

1355
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:46,254
His grades are quite decent:

1356
01:09:46,354 --> 01:09:48,733
arithmetic: Excellent, Excellent-

1357
01:09:48,833 --> 01:09:50,942
and Satisfactory, just as I said

1358
01:09:51,042 --> 01:09:52,042
And George Kroupa,

1359
01:09:52,142 --> 01:09:53,142
if you'll be kind,

1360
01:09:52,242 --> 01:09:53,242
Mr. Professor.

1361
01:09:54,059 --> 01:09:55,242
Sorry, it closed.

1362
01:09:55,527 --> 01:09:58,989
Kroupa knows math, it's in order.

1363
01:09:59,089 --> 01:10:00,089
Here he is.

1364
01:10:02,053 --> 01:10:03,221
Although,

1365
01:10:04,061 --> 01:10:06,911
lately, I haven't noticed,

1366
01:10:07,011 --> 01:10:10,046
Test Failed, again Failed, orally Satisfactory

1367
01:10:11,328 --> 01:10:14,705
These are maybe my grades, Mr. Professor.

1368
01:10:14,805 --> 01:10:17,070
Ha-ha. Yes

1369
01:10:17,654 --> 01:10:19,293
Wrong page.

1370
01:10:19,393 --> 01:10:22,085
This is about another student
from another class.

1371
01:10:22,185 --> 01:10:25,149
He's good, as I say. Very good, Excellent, Excellent

1372
01:10:25,249 --> 01:10:26,249
You can be satisfied.

1373
01:10:26,887 --> 01:10:29,865
I know. With the son.

1374
01:10:30,275 --> 01:10:31,275
Please, colleague,

1375
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:33,469
for a moment.

1376
01:10:34,951 --> 01:10:35,963
Excuse me.

1377
01:10:38,371 --> 01:10:39,710
Did you call them?

1378
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:40,810
Who?

1379
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:42,232
The family members.

1380
01:10:42,332 --> 01:10:43,332
These here?

1381
01:10:43,432 --> 01:10:45,381
No, those old ladies, children, brothers-in-law

1382
01:10:45,481 --> 01:10:47,404
of the students from the evening school

1383
01:10:47,504 --> 01:10:48,504
I know nothing.

1384
01:10:48,604 --> 01:10:50,823
Didn't you notice the crowd in the corridors?

1385
01:10:50,923 --> 01:10:52,419
I sent them to the drawing room.

1386
01:10:52,519 --> 01:10:54,072
Now, they are sitting and waiting.

1387
01:10:54,172 --> 01:10:55,383
Please, comrades,

1388
01:10:55,483 --> 01:10:56,483
he did not call them,

1389
01:10:56,637 --> 01:10:57,637
what shall we do?

1390
01:10:57,737 --> 01:10:59,030
I think that Janda as a class teacher

1391
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,327
should take care of it.

1392
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:01,652
But I am not ready here.

1393
01:11:01,752 --> 01:11:04,858
It doesn't matter, please finish it quickly

1394
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:05,958
Yes.

1395
01:11:06,058 --> 01:11:07,394
and I will calm them down.

1396
01:11:07,494 --> 01:11:10,130
And you in your classes, also give it some speed

1397
01:11:10,244 --> 01:11:12,509
and come quickly there.

1398
01:11:12,609 --> 01:11:15,658
and give info on grades, and etc.

1399
01:11:15,758 --> 01:11:16,758
But I don't understand...

1400
01:11:16,997 --> 01:11:18,621
Speed it up, speed it up!

1401
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:20,103
Please, please.

1402
01:11:20,203 --> 01:11:21,203
Yes.

1403
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:25,745
Dear friends,

1404
01:11:25,845 --> 01:11:27,968
I, as a headmaster,

1405
01:11:28,068 --> 01:11:30,476
would like to express my satisfaction,

1406
01:11:30,803 --> 01:11:32,470
that you have come here,

1407
01:11:32,969 --> 01:11:34,622
in such great numbers.

1408
01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:35,722
Believe,

1409
01:11:35,822 --> 01:11:37,429
we did not expect it.

1410
01:11:37,529 --> 01:11:39,438
Although we suspected it,

1411
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,390
when we prepared for it,

1412
01:11:41,603 --> 01:11:44,068
that it won't pass unnoticed.

1413
01:11:44,168 --> 01:11:45,168
You know,

1414
01:11:45,268 --> 01:11:48,471
the cooperation of school and family

1415
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:51,221
is very imortant.

1416
01:11:51,321 --> 01:11:53,273
It is not only about

1417
01:11:53,373 --> 01:11:55,281
basic behaviour,

1418
01:11:55,381 --> 01:11:57,162
formation of the individual,

1419
01:11:57,262 --> 01:11:59,770
but also for some known issues

1420
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:00,870
not very noticeable, but

1421
01:12:00,970 --> 01:12:03,332
important details,

1422
01:12:03,432 --> 01:12:04,432
Look,

1423
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:07,820
They would often go dirty to school.

1424
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:08,920
I have instructed

1425
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,282
the comrade janitor

1426
01:12:11,382 --> 01:12:14,388
that the most notorious slatterns,

1427
01:12:14,488 --> 01:12:16,098
excuse my language,

1428
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:17,808
he would pull for the ears

1429
01:12:17,908 --> 01:12:19,589
and take back home.

1430
01:12:19,689 --> 01:12:21,213
Obviously, it concerns

1431
01:12:21,313 --> 01:12:24,048
younger students, especially.

1432
01:12:24,148 --> 01:12:25,658
And, here,

1433
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,066
this was my introduction.

1434
01:12:28,422 --> 01:12:31,044
And here we have the class teacher

1435
01:12:31,144 --> 01:12:33,495
and he will deal with it

1436
01:12:33,595 --> 01:12:34,595
by himself

1437
01:12:34,695 --> 01:12:37,926
and will be more precise.

1438
01:12:38,638 --> 01:12:39,750
Please.

1439
01:12:46,389 --> 01:12:47,643
What class are you looking for?

1440
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:49,338
Good evening.

1441
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:51,162
I received a letter from my nephew

1442
01:12:51,262 --> 01:12:53,271
that there was a meeting

1443
01:12:53,371 --> 01:12:54,539
What's his name?

1444
01:12:54,639 --> 01:12:55,639
Hujer.

1445
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:57,873
He attends the evening school.

1446
01:12:58,015 --> 01:12:59,554
Here, behind the corner, in the drawing room.

1447
01:12:59,654 --> 01:13:02,803
Thank you. You are very kind.

1448
01:13:06,066 --> 01:13:07,718
Please. Please, sir.

1449
01:13:07,818 --> 01:13:09,898
Where is Hujer's class?

1450
01:13:09,998 --> 01:13:12,620
Stairs up and right. It's the drawing room.

1451
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:13,720
Thank you.

1452
01:13:15,367 --> 01:13:16,367
What are you doing here?

1453
01:13:16,467 --> 01:13:18,148
We come for uncle Hujer.

1454
01:13:18,248 --> 01:13:19,248
We want to ask...

1455
01:13:19,348 --> 01:13:21,254
Next floor, drawing room.

1456
01:13:21,354 --> 01:13:22,551
Excuse me...

1457
01:13:22,651 --> 01:13:25,543
Hujer.  Next floor, drawing room.

1458
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:32,196
I cannot make any compromise

1459
01:13:32,296 --> 01:13:36,300
At this school the technical subjects are the most important.

1460
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,400
And you?

1461
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,207
Hujer, Robert.

1462
01:13:39,307 --> 01:13:41,614
The older brother of Viktor Hujer.

1463
01:13:41,714 --> 01:13:43,338
Hujer, he is

1464
01:13:43,524 --> 01:13:45,846
a very dedicated student, but

1465
01:13:45,946 --> 01:13:50,534
his ability of independent thinking is weaker

1466
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:53,796
but his diligence, untamed,

1467
01:13:54,195 --> 01:13:56,618
he will get the grades, don't worry.

1468
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:58,798
What did he say?

1469
01:13:58,898 --> 01:14:01,234
That he'll graduate.

1470
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,585
You?

1471
01:14:03,685 --> 01:14:05,181
I am Zelenková, Hujer's sister.

1472
01:14:05,281 --> 01:14:06,281
Well, you've heard it.

1473
01:14:06,703 --> 01:14:07,703
You?

1474
01:14:07,803 --> 01:14:08,803
I am Hujerová.

1475
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:09,903
Wife?

1476
01:14:10,003 --> 01:14:11,003
No, I am the wife.

1477
01:14:11,103 --> 01:14:13,217
I am his sister-in-law.

1478
01:14:13,317 --> 01:14:14,317
You?

1479
01:14:14,417 --> 01:14:15,417
I am his cousin.

1480
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:17,479
And you?

1481
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:18,579
Hujerová, wife.

1482
01:14:18,679 --> 01:14:19,679
But the wife is...

1483
01:14:19,779 --> 01:14:21,067
I am from the first marriage.

1484
01:14:21,609 --> 01:14:22,634
OK, then

1485
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:24,401
So, that everyone can hear me.

1486
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,880
What is the Hujers' range?

1487
01:14:27,707 --> 01:14:29,844
Hujer? Does he study here?

1488
01:14:31,565 --> 01:14:34,802
Hey, Máňa! From Čáslav!

1489
01:14:38,818 --> 01:14:40,416
Silence, please!

1490
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:52,384
Sit.

1491
01:14:55,274 --> 01:14:56,274
You are?

1492
01:14:57,528 --> 01:14:58,824
From Kojčice,

1493
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:00,976
near Pelhřimov.

1494
01:15:01,945 --> 01:15:03,996
And who are you interested in?

1495
01:15:04,481 --> 01:15:05,492
Our son.

1496
01:15:05,963 --> 01:15:07,302
Plha,

1497
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:09,567
Mr. Teacher.

1498
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:13,913
He is „Very good“.

1499
01:15:15,737 --> 01:15:17,033
Very good.

1500
01:15:17,318 --> 01:15:18,472
Very good.

1501
01:15:18,572 --> 01:15:19,572
Let's go.

1502
01:15:21,878 --> 01:15:23,573
God bless you.

1503
01:15:30,153 --> 01:15:31,153
Hello.

1504
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:33,875
What's for dinner.

1505
01:15:33,975 --> 01:15:34,975
Come.

1506
01:15:36,368 --> 01:15:38,135
I asked about you.

1507
01:15:38,235 --> 01:15:39,901
You are OK with math

1508
01:15:40,001 --> 01:15:41,754


1509
01:15:41,854 --> 01:15:43,592
and then you have a Good in history.

1510
01:15:43,692 --> 01:15:45,814
You'll have to fix it.

1511
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,125
So what?

1512
01:15:47,225 --> 01:15:48,225
Will there be a soup?

1513
01:15:48,325 --> 01:15:49,462
Wait, father.

1514
01:15:49,562 --> 01:15:51,898
We asked about you.

1515
01:15:51,998 --> 01:15:54,292
And we won't eat because of it?

1516
01:15:54,392 --> 01:15:56,272
Aren't you interested how it went?

1517
01:15:56,372 --> 01:15:57,372
Of course.

1518
01:15:57,472 --> 01:15:59,735
Turnout was abundant, yes?

1519
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:02,641
14 people came for Hujer.

1520
01:16:02,741 --> 01:16:04,778
Wait, seriously,

1521
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,602
it's tragic for you in math

1522
01:16:06,702 --> 01:16:09,067
I know, this is no big news,

1523
01:16:09,167 --> 01:16:11,789
You could ask me and not go to school.

1524
01:16:11,889 --> 01:16:13,285
I don't want to keep you accountable for it, but

1525
01:16:13,385 --> 01:16:15,222
It's the last thing that would happen

1526
01:16:15,322 --> 01:16:17,416
that you keep me accountable, what?

1527
01:16:17,516 --> 01:16:19,468
Let George speak, please.

1528
01:16:19,568 --> 01:16:21,221
As if somebody is stopping him.

1529
01:16:21,321 --> 01:16:23,743
Please talk, so that your mother won't go crazy.

1530
01:16:24,028 --> 01:16:25,538
Come, we'll learn together.

1531
01:16:25,638 --> 01:16:27,290
Every evening, two hours

1532
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:28,390
or three, well?

1533
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:31,892
It's only about mathematics.

1534
01:16:31,992 --> 01:16:32,992
Father,

1535
01:16:33,092 --> 01:16:34,092
think about it

1536
01:16:34,628 --> 01:16:36,495
the boy means only well.

1537
01:16:36,595 --> 01:16:37,595
Well,

1538
01:16:37,695 --> 01:16:39,444
You are very kind, sonny

1539
01:16:39,544 --> 01:16:40,544
but with this

1540
01:16:40,644 --> 01:16:42,536
I must deal alone,

1541
01:16:42,636 --> 01:16:44,602
you know that we would fight

1542
01:16:44,758 --> 01:16:45,998
and that I would be nervous.

1543
01:16:46,454 --> 01:16:48,990
And then you have your own issues.

1544
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:50,671
Get better with history.

1545
01:16:50,771 --> 01:16:52,467
It's also important

1546
01:16:52,567 --> 01:16:54,960
because, if someone doesn't know history,

1547
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:57,354
it's worse than not knowing

1548
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:58,510
biology.

1549
01:16:58,610 --> 01:16:59,610
You are so stubborn!

1550
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:01,685
I shouln't give you any soup.

1551
01:17:01,785 --> 01:17:02,785
As you wish!

1552
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:04,178
I can go to a restaurant.

1553
01:17:04,278 --> 01:17:07,042
I still have enough for a soup!

1554
01:17:11,682 --> 01:17:12,682
Hujer,

1555
01:17:12,782 --> 01:17:14,235
One minute before break's end

1556
01:17:14,335 --> 01:17:16,116
you must tell Janda to come to class

1557
01:17:16,443 --> 01:17:18,908
Maybe his watch is broken.

1558
01:17:19,008 --> 01:17:20,008
Me?

1559
01:17:20,108 --> 01:17:21,108
Why me exactly?

1560
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:24,251
He said that you are the most trustworthy

1561
01:17:24,664 --> 01:17:25,676
True.

1562
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:27,229
But, I'll have to...

1563
01:17:27,329 --> 01:17:28,329
Oh, yes.

1564
01:17:28,429 --> 01:17:29,680
Not to make a mistake.

1565
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:30,780
You know what to do.

1566
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,985
2 min. 30 sec.!

1567
01:17:33,085 --> 01:17:34,085
Better go.

1568
01:17:37,428 --> 01:17:38,428
Enter.

1569
01:17:39,568 --> 01:17:40,936
Enter.

1570
01:17:48,615 --> 01:17:50,297
Comrade Professor,

1571
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,833
there is a minute to class.

1572
01:17:53,388 --> 01:17:54,600
And what?

1573
01:17:55,155 --> 01:17:57,278
The class will start.

1574
01:17:58,233 --> 01:17:59,544
Yes.

1575
01:18:00,253 --> 01:18:01,253
Yes.

1576
01:18:01,353 --> 01:18:03,063
It's time, we must go.

1577
01:18:05,115 --> 01:18:06,767
Listen, Hujer,

1578
01:18:07,038 --> 01:18:10,329
I can't say you lack diligence,

1579
01:18:10,429 --> 01:18:12,224
but at the moment it is almost

1580
01:18:12,324 --> 01:18:14,333
insolence.

1581
01:18:16,513 --> 01:18:17,938
Is it fast?

1582
01:18:18,038 --> 01:18:19,633
I set them this morning

1583
01:18:19,733 --> 01:18:20,733
to the radio.

1584
01:18:25,945 --> 01:18:27,085
He's coming!

1585
01:18:36,147 --> 01:18:38,355
Hujer, how come that your things are not ready?

1586
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,777
I had to remind you, and had no time.

1587
01:18:40,877 --> 01:18:43,029
Please, excuse me, I otherwise always...

1588
01:18:43,129 --> 01:18:44,995
Next time, take care of yourself.

1589
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:47,488
I will take care of my duties.

1590
01:18:49,153 --> 01:18:50,153
Everybody sit.

1591
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:54,584
Thanks, I have my own.

1592
01:18:56,350 --> 01:19:00,340
Kroupa to the blackboard, please!

1593
01:19:03,645 --> 01:19:05,612
You have an angle Beta...

1594
01:19:05,712 --> 01:19:07,692
No, I don't have.

1595
01:19:09,031 --> 01:19:12,308
You have an angle Beta, and sides A and B

1596
01:19:12,408 --> 01:19:14,659
Draw a triangle.

1597
01:19:29,206 --> 01:19:30,702
Side A

1598
01:19:31,569 --> 01:19:32,569
And now

1599
01:19:33,324 --> 01:19:35,091
we draw

1600
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,086
side

1601
01:19:38,639 --> 01:19:40,192
side

1602
01:19:43,896 --> 01:19:45,064
side B.

1603
01:19:48,983 --> 01:19:50,023
Side B.

1604
01:19:53,627 --> 01:19:54,710
How do you know that

1605
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:56,035
side B goes this way?

1606
01:19:56,135 --> 01:19:58,515
I don't see the angle.

1607
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,236
Plha is raising a hand.

1608
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:02,703
I have a question.

1609
01:20:02,917 --> 01:20:04,499
How could he know that

1610
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:07,163
side B will go this way?

1611
01:20:07,576 --> 01:20:09,186
Please, sit.

1612
01:20:09,386 --> 01:20:11,081
Comrade Kroupa, these are basic things.

1613
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:13,332
You must know this unconditionally.

1614
01:20:14,686 --> 01:20:16,196
By the way, not to forget

1615
01:20:16,296 --> 01:20:18,106
Yesterday at the council we agreed

1616
01:20:18,206 --> 01:20:19,206
that those students, who feel

1617
01:20:19,306 --> 01:20:22,337
that they won't make it through school

1618
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:25,401
I don't mean directly you,

1619
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:27,965
Have the possibility to

1620
01:20:28,065 --> 01:20:29,547
leave school on their own desire.

1621
01:20:29,647 --> 01:20:30,858
in order to avoid

1622
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:35,103
the unpleasant fact of dropping out.

1623
01:20:46,559 --> 01:20:48,283
What are you doing?

1624
01:20:48,836 --> 01:20:49,836
Feeding them.

1625
01:20:50,086 --> 01:20:52,086
Don't you want something for them?

1626
01:20:52,336 --> 01:20:53,336
No.

1627
01:20:54,652 --> 01:20:56,718
Yeah, I wanted to...

1628
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,256
Listen,

1629
01:20:58,356 --> 01:21:00,550
let's not speak generally about

1630
01:21:00,864 --> 01:21:02,987
two hours of learning together

1631
01:21:03,471 --> 01:21:07,461
it has to make sense

1632
01:21:07,803 --> 01:21:09,014
I was thinking

1633
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:10,114
what would you say about

1634
01:21:11,208 --> 01:21:14,186
between 8 and 10 in the evenings?

1635
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:17,035
Is it OK with you? Is it?

1636
01:21:17,506 --> 01:21:19,700
If not, then tell me.

1637
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:28,234
Don't you smoke?

1638
01:21:32,081 --> 01:21:33,178
No.

1639
01:21:33,535 --> 01:21:36,712
When I smoke, I throw up

1640
01:21:49,407 --> 01:21:50,946
You, Hujer.

1641
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:53,807
Šlajs knows about a locomotive.

1642
01:21:53,907 --> 01:21:54,907
Come on!

1643
01:21:55,007 --> 01:21:57,072
Don't you say anything about a locomotive.

1644
01:21:57,172 --> 01:21:58,269
This is again some kind of a

1645
01:21:58,469 --> 01:21:59,822
joke.

1646
01:21:59,922 --> 01:22:01,518
No, Really, Šlajs found it.

1647
01:22:01,618 --> 01:22:02,618
An old one.

1648
01:22:02,718 --> 01:22:04,510
And if we take it for the recyclables,

1649
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:07,331
I know your ideas.

1650
01:22:07,431 --> 01:22:08,431
You are...

1651
01:22:08,531 --> 01:22:09,531
like little kids

1652
01:22:09,631 --> 01:22:12,417
Don't be an asshole, this is 20 t. of iron.

1653
01:22:12,517 --> 01:22:14,498
Immediately, it's first place in the republic in recyclables.

1654
01:22:14,598 --> 01:22:15,598
Really.

1655
01:22:16,435 --> 01:22:17,604
Bring it.

1656
01:22:17,704 --> 01:22:18,704
I'll weight it

1657
01:22:19,126 --> 01:22:20,126
and write it down.

1658
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:21,226
You don't want it? OK

1659
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:23,346
You could have won a bycicle.

1660
01:22:23,446 --> 01:22:24,446
A bycicle!

1661
01:22:29,999 --> 01:22:31,709
Stand up, Kroupa!

1662
01:22:31,809 --> 01:22:32,809
Sit down!

1663
01:22:32,909 --> 01:22:33,909
Stand up!

1664
01:22:35,511 --> 01:22:36,511
Yes, please?

1665
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,577
No, nothing.

1666
01:22:38,888 --> 01:22:39,888
Sorry.

1667
01:22:40,201 --> 01:22:41,327
What is it?

1668
01:22:43,008 --> 01:22:45,045
You had a crazy night, didn't you?

1669
01:22:45,145 --> 01:22:46,641
I study at night with my son

1670
01:22:47,223 --> 01:22:48,223
and then get up at 5.

1671
01:22:48,323 --> 01:22:49,323
Oh, yeah.

1672
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:50,423
Yeah, yeah.

1673
01:22:51,757 --> 01:22:53,158
Please.

1674
01:22:53,258 --> 01:22:55,159
<i>Hujer Fruits and Vegetables</i>

1675
01:22:55,317 --> 01:22:56,686
I took

1676
01:22:56,786 --> 01:22:58,723
Silence. Don't disturb!

1677
01:22:59,222 --> 01:23:00,390
I took the liberty

1678
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:01,858
if you won't feel insulted

1679
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:03,368
Thank you, Hujer.

1680
01:23:03,468 --> 01:23:05,035
Thank you.

1681
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:11,928
And now, we'll detect

1682
01:23:13,185 --> 01:23:15,436
the presence of aluminium.

1683
01:23:15,664 --> 01:23:18,371
Aluminum moved to Humpolec.

1684
01:23:18,471 --> 01:23:22,717
What is a logarithm of  a product?

1685
01:23:23,529 --> 01:23:27,433
Logarithm of a product is equal to

1686
01:23:27,704 --> 01:23:29,357
the sum of the

1687
01:23:29,599 --> 01:23:32,377
logarithm of the [yawning]

1688
01:23:32,477 --> 01:23:33,477
But, dad.

1689
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:35,797
Factors!

1690
01:23:36,281 --> 01:23:37,635
It's a multiplication!

1691
01:23:38,874 --> 01:23:41,482
I did say „factors“. I said it like

1692
01:23:41,582 --> 01:23:42,582
a bit differnet

1693
01:23:42,682 --> 01:23:43,682
I am learning this words, well?

1694
01:23:44,474 --> 01:23:45,599
Don't cheat!

1695
01:23:45,956 --> 01:23:49,176
On the writing test you'll be on your own.

1696
01:23:49,404 --> 01:23:50,985
I am not cheating.

1697
01:23:51,227 --> 01:23:52,852
So, listen.

1698
01:23:55,342 --> 01:23:56,342
What did I say?

1699
01:23:56,442 --> 01:23:58,223
factor or term?

1700
01:23:58,505 --> 01:23:59,505
Term.

1701
01:23:59,605 --> 01:24:00,605
Now you see.

1702
01:24:00,705 --> 01:24:01,705
You suspect me wrongly

1703
01:24:02,013 --> 01:24:03,652
and I actually said

1704
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:04,752
"Chinese"

1705
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:10,804
So, how did you do that test?

1706
01:24:10,904 --> 01:24:11,904
Well,

1707
01:24:12,004 --> 01:24:14,181
I solved everything.

1708
01:24:14,375 --> 01:24:17,330
George said that I did well.

1709
01:24:17,701 --> 01:24:20,736
If there wasn't some trap, then

1710
01:24:20,836 --> 01:24:22,000
it would be fine.

1711
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,100
Let's hope.

1712
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:26,562
It was a hard test. A hard one!

1713
01:24:26,662 --> 01:24:29,840
I had a lot of work with it.

1714
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:34,826
The test did not turn out the best.

1715
01:24:34,926 --> 01:24:37,206
A lot of good students disappointed me.

1716
01:24:37,448 --> 01:24:39,286
Svátek. Good.

1717
01:24:40,112 --> 01:24:42,962
Tuček, Šlajs. Satisfactory.

1718
01:24:43,361 --> 01:24:45,541
Same mistakes, same grades.

1719
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:50,086
On the other hand, some poor students,

1720
01:24:50,186 --> 01:24:51,186
Kroupa,

1721
01:24:51,682 --> 01:24:55,543
Take your logarithmical tables and come here.

1722
01:24:57,865 --> 01:24:59,960
What is the result of logarithm

1723
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:03,679
Please, if Plha may hand me the glasses.

1724
01:25:07,526 --> 01:25:16,374
of  3457 x 40876 / 7222

1725
01:25:16,908 --> 01:25:20,003
Please, lend me those tables.

1726
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:29,638
You give the pen, I give the tables.

1727
01:25:39,156 --> 01:25:40,310
It's correct.

1728
01:25:41,507 --> 01:25:43,772
You really know it.

1729
01:25:44,585 --> 01:25:47,890
Do you know your result from the test?

1730
01:25:48,446 --> 01:25:50,782
I don't dare guessing.

1731
01:25:50,996 --> 01:25:52,535
Excellent.

1732
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,311
We study

1733
01:25:56,411 --> 01:25:57,935
together with my son.

1734
01:25:58,035 --> 01:25:59,744
Great. Greet him from me.

1735
01:25:59,844 --> 01:26:00,844
Thank you.

1736
01:26:06,012 --> 01:26:07,822
Look,

1737
01:26:08,263 --> 01:26:10,172
I'll tell you

1738
01:26:10,514 --> 01:26:11,925
this is quite good.

1739
01:26:12,196 --> 01:26:13,834
It's not bad.

1740
01:26:13,934 --> 01:26:16,598
Though, a Good in history? It's a shame.

1741
01:26:16,698 --> 01:26:18,679
Look my grade in history!

1742
01:26:18,779 --> 01:26:20,388
But you don't have it at all, Dad.

1743
01:26:20,488 --> 01:26:22,298
No? It's a pity.

1744
01:26:22,398 --> 01:26:24,221
I would shine then, little one.

1745
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:26,045
The burning of Jan Hus -

1746
01:26:26,145 --> 01:26:28,039
1749

1747
01:26:28,567 --> 01:26:31,217
My God, your behaviour is Excellent.

1748
01:26:31,373 --> 01:26:32,585
I thought it was Very good.

1749
01:26:32,685 --> 01:26:34,936
You aslo have it Excellent.

1750
01:26:35,036 --> 01:26:36,887
Yes, it's all right.

1751
01:26:36,987 --> 01:26:37,987
Well, Dad,

1752
01:26:38,087 --> 01:26:39,908
there is this Satisfactory in math, but we'll fix it.

1753
01:26:40,008 --> 01:26:44,253
It's not bad at all.

1754
01:26:44,353 --> 01:26:47,018
And you also go to work,

1755
01:26:48,074 --> 01:26:49,283
you deserve a praise.

1756
01:26:49,554 --> 01:26:51,777
Mom, did you hear that?

1757
01:26:51,877 --> 01:26:52,877
Pour the soup.

1758
01:26:53,804 --> 01:26:58,021
I think that we fully deserve it.

1759
01:26:58,447 --> 01:27:00,798
I said „fully“, Mommy.

1760
01:27:01,077 --> 01:27:02,531
Full.

1761
01:27:24,788 --> 01:27:26,037
What's up, George?

1762
01:27:27,257 --> 01:27:28,932
Got comfortable already?

1763
01:27:29,032 --> 01:27:30,783
I would rather not get too comfortable here.

1764
01:27:30,883 --> 01:27:32,942
Let's see the final tests.

1765
01:27:33,042 --> 01:27:35,337
It would be fine.

1766
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:38,290
The beginning is the most difficult.

1767
01:27:39,745 --> 01:27:42,668
AC to 004

1768
01:27:50,602 --> 01:27:52,394
Alleviate 5

1769
01:27:59,079 --> 01:28:01,783
Two buns and a milk.

1770
01:28:01,883 --> 01:28:04,368
Two buns and a milk, Suzy.

1771
01:28:04,603 --> 01:28:05,603
What kind? Full-fat?

1772
01:28:05,703 --> 01:28:06,703
Normal.

1773
01:28:08,644 --> 01:28:09,687
OK.

1774
01:28:16,695 --> 01:28:18,487
Hey, the executive coucil.

1775
01:28:25,863 --> 01:28:27,332
Weld!

1776
01:28:36,617 --> 01:28:38,262
We are welding!

1777
01:29:19,208 --> 01:29:20,383
Up!

1778
01:29:20,783 --> 01:29:21,783
What is this?

1779
01:29:22,578 --> 01:29:24,341
I took the liberty,

1780
01:29:24,441 --> 01:29:26,134
some plums from my little garden,

1781
01:29:26,234 --> 01:29:27,234
if you won't feel insulted,

1782
01:29:27,334 --> 01:29:28,881
Mr. Boss.
