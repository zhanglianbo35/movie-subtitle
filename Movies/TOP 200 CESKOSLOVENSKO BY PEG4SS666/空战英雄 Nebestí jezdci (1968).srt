Karol, look out, he's behind you!
- Attack from the left!

3
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,396
- Shoot, damn you, shoot!

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,312
You know the one
about Hitler coming to heaven?

5
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,719
- Don't shout!
Speak English!

6
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,519
- The wheels! Quickly!
- Oh, mum...

7
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,596
- Look out - he's attacking!

8
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,349
- Tell them at home...
Oh...

Director:

18
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,949
You snore, student!

19
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,316
Not yet.
May I test the guns?

20
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,553
No sign of anti-aircraft guns...

21
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,798
The Jerries must all be on leave.

22
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,871
Or perhaps the war is over...

23
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,076
- Stop it, Titch!

24
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,229
- I got to get warm...

25
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,994
Fireworks ahead of us!

26
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,957
Keep your hats on - we are slipping!

27
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,517
- Give it the works!

28
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,875
- Don't shout, Titch!

29
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,079
It's all right,
Belinda's got their scent!

30
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,789
- They are ours - their port engine
is a bit rough...

31
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,153
Stand still, Belinda -
you'll get under the wheels!

32
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,110
Are you all right?

33
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,592
Well...?

34
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,989
Everything's fine.

35
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,195
Come on, Belinda!

36
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,516
Damn you...

37
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,797
Where are you going, Titch?
Don't be silly!

38
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,236
- Gentlemen - I've had it!
That coffin will never see me again!

39
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,630
Tell the intelligence officer
to go to hell!

40
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,159
He's never been across the Channel
and now he's throwing his weight about.

41
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,839
Off you go, Titch!

42
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,832
- What?
Oh - yeah.

43
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,432
Wait - you get in first, Student!

44
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,077
Darlings - tell her to look at the road!

45
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,397
I've survived the Jerries and now...

46
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,440
What have they cooked up now?

47
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,631
I'll tell you later.
- You don't have to.

48
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,597
He reads so beautifully.

49
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,310
What did he say?

50
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,789
- David's in the sink...

51
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,992
If I'm to die, I've got to eat!

52
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,676
I'll get that jerry yet...

53
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,433
- Don't worry, we'll find him.

54
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,432
Where are you from?

55
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,518
- I'm from Cracow.

56
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,751
We three are from Czechoslovakia. -
Captain... Paul!

57
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,668
They are still bombing.

58
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,038
Which squadron are you with now?

59
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,196
- We've four units of our own already.

60
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,199
- We want to finish our run here -
our squadron

61
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,872
has been posted to the coast.

62
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,758
- This is the Duke of Norfolk -
our second pilot.

63
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,594
We are training him, aren't we?

64
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,513
His daddy will then buy him a bomber...

65
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,632
We'll be assigned to patrol duty.

66
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,630
See you, boys!

67
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,513
- Give my love to Wawel!

68
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,238
- God bless!

69
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,197
- Good luck!

70
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,157
How many runs do you have to make?

71
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,593
- 200 hours.

72
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,476
- We do, too.

73
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,669
Excuse me, gentlemen.

74
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,349
The call of duty...

75
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,475
Good luck!
- Good luck!

76
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,670
Hurry up, Tommy!

77
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,309
The pants are a bit long
but the shirt will do...

78
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,159
Take the shirt and shut up.

79
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,674
What else have we got?

80
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,071
I'd still like to know what happened...

81
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,197
- The engine's on fire -
we are getting into the floats. -

82
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,352
That was the last message received...

83
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,951
- Add some water to the gravy, Student!

84
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,794
It's almost done, boys!

85
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,791
- If they catch you...

86
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,395
- They can lock me up -
but surely not for long...

87
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,634
This will do for me!

88
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,838
She looks like your wife, doesn't she?

89
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,471
Not really.

90
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,198
Bye, bye,
we're off to the dance!

91
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,635
You'll have to keep an eye on me -
I am parched!

92
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,995
- Don't overdo it...

93
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,875
You call this beer?

94
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,354
It needs a shot of whisky!

95
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,469
- Slow down, will you?

96
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,150
She acts as cool as a cucumber
but she's really keen...

97
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,355
- For Christ's sake, Titch!

98
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,637
- So what?
She doesn't understand - do you?

99
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,349
Drink fast - cheers!

100
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,232
Cheers!

101
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,589
Tommy, you bad boy!

102
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,831
- Hallo!
- Got some money?

103
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,592
- Hallo!

104
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,395
Let's go, then...

105
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,516
Student, tell this chap
to mind his step!

106
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,870
- Titch, put the brakes on!
- Why should l?

107
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,554
I knew how to dance
while he was still a babe in arms.

108
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,874
Shall I bash your teeth in?

109
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,629
Get stuffed!

110
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,510
Wait a minute!

111
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,559
We aren't going anywhere!

112
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,111
My love...

113
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,434
Where are you going?
- Wait!

114
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,948
It's really incredible
that I've got you...

115
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,038
Sometimes I think I'm dreaming...

116
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,357
It can't be true!

117
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,749
You are... a dream!

118
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,718
A dream I never want to wake up from.

119
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,317
A dream?

120
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,950
Come and catch me!

121
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,037
You don't even ask
how I fared yesterday.

122
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,714
- Well - and how did you?

123
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,792
- Don't ask!

124
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,996
- Give me a Czech girl anytime, eh?

125
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,311
- Of course -
they've got what it takes...

126
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,430
- What are you doing on Sunday, Titch?

127
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,753
- Why?
- Pat has asked me to her house.

128
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,909
- We'll have none of that!
- Why not?

129
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,752
- I can't let you go on your own -

130
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,071
you've got to keep them
at arm's length...

131
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,633
Belinda, you'll be a bridesmaid!

132
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,838
- Sometimes I feel just like at home!

133
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,118
- We'll need some car away seeds!

134
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,798
- If only we could get
a letter...

135
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,912
From home.
Two lines would do...

136
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,393
Are you sure it's not a hen?

137
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,113
Belinda's got her!

138
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,317
Take cover! Belinda!

139
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,471
The gamekeeper -
he's been waiting for us!

140
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,869
He's heading this way!

141
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,957
That's all we need right now...!

142
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,510
And alert!
What shall we do?

143
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,352
- Divert his attention!
We'll send Belinda across...

144
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,953
- Yes, and he'll shoot her!

145
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,112
I told you he was after us, didn't l?

146
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,437
- So you did - but how do we get away?

147
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,151
To hell with the gamekeeper!

148
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,558
There's nothing for it...
Don't be silly! -

149
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,676
To lose our leave
because of a stupid pheasant?

150
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,719
- Well, what do you want to do?
- We'll swim for the airfield!

151
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,632
I risk my life for him, and he...

152
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,359
Belinda will catch a cold...

153
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,875
Who stole my boots?
Have you got my boots?

154
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,756
Tastes funny...

155
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,596
- Damn that gamekeeper!
I'll get even with him.

156
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,559
I am wet through...

157
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,473
- You'll cool down soon enough...
In the air.

158
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,712
I have no one to say good-bye to.

159
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,474
What a mess -
what does he want now?

160
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,232
- He's asking whether you don't want
to take this off?

161
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,389
- Stick two bottles of beer
into you boots!

162
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,675
We'll be thirsty!

163
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,875
It's your turn now.

164
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,752
The Jerries will get the jitters...

165
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,318
Paul - I've got a funny feeling...

166
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,390
- Premonition, what?

167
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,829
- During a raid, fear makes you sick...

168
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,833
- Really, Paul, I have cramps...

169
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,830
Hurry up! For Christ's sake -
hurry up!

170
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,355
Get out of my way!

171
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,153
Hurry up for Christ's sake!

172
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,919
It's the tinned food they serve us -
I'll never make it!

173
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,316
Get out - or I won't be able
to help it...

174
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,799
Look out, Titch!
You've got him!

175
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,997
- Keep out of my way -
and speak English!

176
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,677
I always warned you -
keep away from a girl's family!

177
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,275
They've got you now. -
You sold your soul for a Sunday lunch.

178
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,877
Now the young lady
will play the piano...

179
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,430
Does this come out of a tin?
- Titch, for heaven's sake!

180
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,512
You are lucky I am keeping an eye
on you!

181
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,238
What did he say?
- He wants a horse.

182
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,118
- I see.

183
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,433
Stop that play under the table
and translate properly!

184
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,790
What did he say?

185
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,715
- That there is nothing like a horse.
- I see.

186
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,360
Look here, tell him
I used to be a jockey!

187
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,232
- Yes. And I made the Thurn-Taxis water
ditch!

188
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,793
- I don't know.

189
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,069
By all means...
Don't be silly, Titch!

190
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,958
I don't need you here...

191
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,552
Cheers!

192
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,549
The body - the carriage -
good breeding always shows!

193
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,113
Must be a puller, eh?

194
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,155
Yes. The horse of today

195
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,712
is either good or bad -

196
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,598
but the best no longer exists!

197
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,638
... the French riviera.

198
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,915
We'll make straight for the brothel
"Emma with the beard"!

199
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,070
I'll book three Turkish odaliss!

200
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,552
Do you think they'll keep you, Titch?

201
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,350
- You bet, I won't lift a finger
till the end of my days!

202
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,358
Unless I model fashions...

203
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,950
"- For a house of "haute couture" -"
or in a factory for rubbers?

204
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,150
We are on fire!

205
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,468
Gunners - do you want to get off now?

206
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,757
I'd never jump into the dark anyway!

207
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,271
We are slow -
we'll never make it by dawn!

208
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,637
Are you listening to Christmas carols?

209
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,198
He fixed the radio so he can pray!

210
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,068
God doesn't exist, Tom!

211
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,033
Paul, we have a fighter trailing us!

212
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,190
- What type?
- A Messerschmidt 109!

213
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,635
- I see.
Tell the boys!

214
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,629
I can see a second!

215
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,235
- Wait till they get closer -
you've only got small shot...

216
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,478
Did you see that, Titch?

217
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,198
You'll be my witness!

218
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,510
- Yes, for a beer!

219
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,956
Come on, boy, come on...
Dirty swine!

220
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,830
What did he say?

221
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,551
I'm hot...

222
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,917
- Don't worry - you'll be all right!

223
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,030
And that's that.

224
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,631
I'm hot...

225
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,556
Who's on guard?

226
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:18,319
Don't worry, we've got an escort worthy
of Churchill...

227
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,269
Paul - we can' t leave him -
he can' t jump!

228
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,591
- Skipper to Stg. Novak -

229
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,071
abandon aircraft immediately!

230
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,912
- Bullshit!

231
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,877
Go, Titch!

232
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,676
- Go!
- Leave me alone! Let go!

233
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,718
Hold on and cover yourself up!

234
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,357
Look out -

235
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,711
I' m landing!

236
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,755
Get out quickly!

237
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,110
Through the back!

238
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,838
Hurry!

239
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,231
Water...

240
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,317
Drink...

241
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,957
Drink...

242
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:36,189
Don' t be sad, Belinda.

243
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,154
... the Fuehrer can guarantee the future
for the Czechs.

244
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,755
Faithful to the glorious past

245
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:35,869
we are returning to the Reich...

246
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:48,589
Come here, Belinda, doggie...

247
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,712
I wish Minister Moravec came in -

248
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,799
we could have a good laugh!

249
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,114
How many have you downed?

250
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,953
- I am not sure - may be two -

251
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:19,038
on night flights they only count
those that go down in flames.

252
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,428
Do you want some fruit?

253
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,317
- I don' t even enjoy the bread here...

254
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,869
This place is supposed to have been

255
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:32,349
built by a king for his mistress.

256
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,272
- And the pantry now serves
as dissecting room, what?

257
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,590
That's a progress!

258
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,675
Come again, will you?

259
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,308
Well - it' s nice, what?
I travel fast -

260
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,839
I'm on my way to see a lady.

261
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,152
One has to eat fast, talk fast,

262
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,117
grab anything that goes. -

263
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,395
There's a war on, you know...

264
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,233
- How do you talk to her, Titch?

265
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,592
- A passionate man doesn't waste words!

266
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,515
This serves instead of a calendar!

267
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,398
I'm learning English at last...

268
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,831
This is the only method that suits me.

269
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,190
How is Pat, Titch?

270
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,118
She doesn't write...

271
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,476
- I don't know.

272
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,270
I never really knew her.
And with my English...

273
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,234
I am sure she's busy.

274
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,435
Do you sleep well?

275
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,398
- Yes.

276
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,596
I almost forgot! -

277
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,875
Do you know where we have been poaching?
- No.

278
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,473
- The preserve belongs to an aunt
of Frank's...

279
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,232
And she went and complained!

280
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:30,438
- So what?
- Frank sends you a permit to hunt. -

281
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,394
Valid for a whole year.

282
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,677
- Thanks.

283
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:47,320
I can hear our planes.

284
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,074
We're now on meteorological research
flights.

285
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,628
I've marked down where we can pinch
vegetables...

286
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,711
And eggs.

287
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:07,309
Tommy is out of it -
he's been appointed instructor.

288
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,514
The wireless operator on test-flights
had a date

289
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,512
and Tommy volunteered for the job.
For a beer...

290
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,989
- They hit a balloon.

291
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,117
- We should make a flag of our own.

292
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,595
They're not supposed to bury you
without one.

293
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,552
That's in the regulations.

294
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:25,030
- I managed to get some red and white
cloth.

295
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,312
This will do for the triangle.

296
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,796
You'll see you'll soon find something!

297
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,836
Frank will leave us soon. -

298
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,036
He'll get a promotion...

299
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,395
He's done his turn.

300
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,918
Others only talk about flying...

301
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,677
It's getting rather hot in Russia now.

302
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,390
What do you think of Stalingrad?
Great, what?

303
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,119
How about going for a walk?

304
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,631
I'm not looking forward
to this autumn.

305
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,628
Everything's a mess.

306
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,953
- Titch - Pat has another friend, what?

307
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,678
- Well - you were away for a long time.

308
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,479
She never had any girl-friends...

309
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,394
After all - we are all here today
and gone tomorrow...

310
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,390
- Do I know him?

311
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,511
- You do. -

312
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,152
He saved you life.

313
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:22,075
- My life? He should have left me there!

314
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,549
- It's all over anyway.

315
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:28,791
She is going to marry an Englishman.

316
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,954
- Why didn't I stay at home?

317
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,671
I'd have crammed Latin grammar
in comfort!

318
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,519
- Don't be silly!

319
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,396
The president will meet us
when we return!

320
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,038
There will be girls with flowers...

321
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:43,715
- Yeah... We'll get a medal
and a tobacconist's...!

322
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,276
- How could they forget this?

323
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,391
- We'll see!

324
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,914
I don't need any help!

325
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,279
You are a pain in the neck.

326
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:07,193
Hey, Belinda, what's that?

327
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,512
The moment we stop watching you...

328
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,470
Get out of my way!

329
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:37,112
We'll - what's the toast?
I'm thirsty.

330
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,391
Welcome back.

331
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,432
Thanks.

332
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,398
- Well - did the old man agree?

333
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:51,189
- Yes. Frank is leaving next week -
Jimmy will take your place -

334
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,838
and you'll be our wireless operator.

335
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,990
I hope you still remember
your instructions from training course.

336
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:58,709
- Of course I do!
Now we are together again!

337
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,592
Stupid!

338
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,435
I hope they keep our supper for us.

339
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,717
- Student!

340
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,630
It makes me think...

341
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:35,669
I once took a girl our boating
on the river.

342
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,912
It rained - but we didn't mind...

343
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,309
And I said to her...

344
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,592
For heaven's sake, boys, a submarine!

345
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,478
Quickly, Paul, she's submerging!

346
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,309
A German jumped out!

347
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:17,396
Look out, Jim - a Messerchmidt!
He's right behind us!

348
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:20,233
Fire, for Christ's sake, fire!

349
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:21,669
Make for the dinghy, I'll help you.

350
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:17,110
No! My boat! No!

351
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,433
Go away!

352
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,550
Go away!

353
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,270
- Hold on, Titch!

354
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,152
Can you see any of the others?

355
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,194
You! You killed them!

356
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,635
- Where are the others?

357
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,949
It's oil - oil in his lungs!

358
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,954
- Titch, where are they?

359
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,193
They are bringing my horse.

360
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:05,036
I need my cap!

361
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,838
- Titch!

362
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,394
- Let me go! Let go...

363
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,439
Why are you holding me?

364
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,631
- Have a drink! You must!

365
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,597
- Let go!

366
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,198
- Titch...

367
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,479
Why are you holding me?

368
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,192
An airplane!

369
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,634
Do you hear?

370
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,312
I have to go...
- Shut up, Titch!

371
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:54,074
- I have to go!
- Shut up!

372
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,310
- I have to go!

373
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,112
- It's ours!

374
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,836
It's one of ours!

375
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,960
- Turn the wheel!

376
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,356
They're on our frequency now!

377
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,158
It's ours!

378
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,515
Titch, do you hear?
It's one of ours!

379
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,477
- I can't any faster.
- Faster!

380
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:30,549
- But I can't!
I can't! I can't!

381
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,117
Titch!

382
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,991
Titch...

383
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:21,669
Our Father, Thou art in Heaven...

384
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:37,155
I'll help.
- No, I'll do it alone.

385
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,677
