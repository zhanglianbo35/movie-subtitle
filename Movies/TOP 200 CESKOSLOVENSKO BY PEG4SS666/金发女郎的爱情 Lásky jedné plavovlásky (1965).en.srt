<i>What happened yesterday
doesn't happen every day</i>

3
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:27,786
<i>As lovely as a dream</i>

4
00:00:27,854 --> 00:00:29,788
<i>And I love her so, ho, yeah</i>

5
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:32,791
<i>And I love her so, ho, yeah</i>

6
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,796
<i>So this great love of mine
turned me into a hooligan</i>

7
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:41,800
<i>I whisper in her little ear:
What lovely lips you have</i>

8
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:44,803
<i>And she says: Yeah, man
Why aren't you kissing me?</i>

9
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:46,805
<i>And I love her, oh, yeah</i>

10
00:00:47,874 --> 00:00:49,808
<i>And I love her so, oh, yeah</i>

11
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:54,813

turned me into a hooligan</i>

12
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:59,818
<i>I whisper in her little ear:
What beautiful eyes you have</i>

13
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:02,821
<i>And she says: Yeah, man
You're just kidding me</i>

14
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:07,826
<i>And I love her so, oh, yeah</i>

15
00:01:07,894 --> 00:01:11,830
LOVES OF A BLONDE

16
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:17,768
<i>I whisper in her little ear:
What pretty hair you have</i>

17
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:20,772
<i>And she says: Yeah, man
Why don't you play with it?</i>

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,774
<i>And I love her so, oh, yeah</i>

19
00:01:22,842 --> 00:01:25,777
<i>And I love her so, oh, yeah</i>

20
00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:29,781
<i>So this great love of mine
turned me into a hooligan</i>

21
00:01:32,852 --> 00:01:35,787
<i>I whisper in her little ear:
What a pretty blouse you have</i>

22
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:37,789
<i>And she says: Yeah, man
Why don't you take it off?</i>

23
00:01:37,857 --> 00:01:40,792
<i>And I love her so, oh, yeah</i>

24
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,795
<i>And I love her so, oh, yeah</i>

25
00:01:43,863 --> 00:01:47,799
<i>So this great love of mine
turned me into a hooligan</i>

26
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:52,804
<i>I whisper in her little ear:
What a nice skirt you have</i>

27
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:55,807
<i>And she says: Yeah, man
Why don't you slip it off?</i>

28
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,809
<i>And I love her so, oh, yeah</i>

29
00:01:57,877 --> 00:02:00,812
<i>And I love her so, oh, yeah</i>

30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,816

31
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:09,821
<i>I whisper in her little ear:
Let's go to the movies</i>

32
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,824
<i>And she says: Yeah, man
it's a stupid movie</i>

33
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:28,773
God, isn't that just beautiful?
Can I borrow it?

34
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:31,776
-Just for a minute, okay?
-All right.

35
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:34,779
Gee, it's so gorgeous.

36
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,785
-Is it gold?
-Of course.

37
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:42,787
The real thing?

38
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:45,790
You think he would give me
anything else?

39
00:02:45,858 --> 00:02:47,792
Let me have it for a while.

40
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,795
Did you notice the stone?
It's a real diamond.

41
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:51,795
A real one?

42
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:54,799
Yes. Look how it sparkles.

43
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:56,801
I've never seen a real diamond.

44
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,804
He told me it was.

45
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:04,809
-He's nice, isn't he?
-Really nice.

46
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:07,812
Do you have his picture?

47
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:19,758
What color are his eyes?

48
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:23,762
Well...they're...sort of...

49
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,765
I don't really know.

50
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,769
Well, then...

51
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:35,774
You've got to put it higher.
He's half a head taller.

52
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:37,776
About like this?

53
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:41,780
That's it. You look
great together.

54
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:46,785
And what did you give him?

55
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:48,787
Nothing yet. That's dumb,
isn't it?

56
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:51,790
It is dumb. You've got to give
him something.

57
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:54,793
Yes, but what?

58
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:26,758
Is that yours?

59
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:34,766
What do you think you're doing
hanging things on the trees?

60
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,775
You can't do that. You can't
just hang things up like that.

61
00:04:44,844 --> 00:04:47,779
You'll dress up the whole forest.

62
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,786
I don't think it's going to
hurt the trees, is it?

63
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:57,789
No, but a deer could be going
by, you know,

64
00:04:57,857 --> 00:05:00,792
and see a tie on a tree
and get scared.

65
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,795
Have you ever seen a
startled deer?

66
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:04,795
No.

67
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:07,799
This is what he does.

68
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,805
See? Did you like it?

69
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:17,741
We could listen to his bleating
together some time.

70
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,744
What do you say?

71
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:25,750
Well, how about it?

72
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:27,752
I don't know.

73
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:33,758
He told me all about those
animals, see?

74
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:37,762
Like they don't live together all
the time, like people do.

75
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,766
And the animals do it
only once a year,...

76
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:44,769
when it's mating time, see?

77
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:49,774
Then they're single again and
they just live on their own...

78
00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:53,778
without any commitment...
not like people.

79
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:57,782
Only the wild geese, they're
like people, see?

80
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,785
-They are?
-Yes.

81
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:03,788
They live together for
up to 120 years.

82
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:06,791
-They do?
-Isn't that something?

83
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:08,793
And imagine, when they...

84
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:13,798
like when he shoots down
either him, see, or her...

85
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:15,800
-The goose?
-Yes.

86
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:20,739
Then the other one remains alone,
even for a hundred years.

87
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:22,741
What about Tonda?

88
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:30,739
Well...he, when we went away...
we left the tie hanging there

89
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:34,753
and when we came back, it
was still hanging there,...

90
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:36,755
so I guess he didn't come.

91
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:38,757
Will you go out with this guy?

92
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:41,760
I don't know.

93
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:44,763
The trouble is, he's married.

94
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:46,765
-He is?
-Yeah.

95
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:50,769
<i>Fine, but we can't ignore the fact
that we need the people here.</i>

96
00:06:50,837 --> 00:06:52,771
<i>Of course, that's right.</i>

97
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,773
<i>We need them.</i>

98
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:57,776
<i>If a girl has a real reason, like
if she has a boyfriend...</i>

99
00:06:57,844 --> 00:07:00,779
she'll get married,
if it's serious.

100
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:02,781
She'll marry him and then
maybe move away.

101
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:04,783
We can accept that as
a reason,...

102
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:07,786
but we can't make her come here
three times in a row...

103
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:09,788
claiming she's getting married
when she isn't.

104
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:12,791
So I won't let her go for now.

105
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:15,828
Only after she gets married.

106
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:18,729
Keep in mind that the factory
must meet deadlines.

107
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:22,734
Yes, but for God's sake, they
also need to have a life.

108
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:24,736
That's a problem.

109
00:07:25,805 --> 00:07:28,740
Look here, if we
look at the map...

110
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:31,743
then from our point of view,...

111
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:35,747
it's not advantageous to put
the army in this area,...

112
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:37,749
to have troops here.

113
00:07:38,818 --> 00:07:41,753
We understand your reasons.

114
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:43,755
Yes, of course.

115
00:07:44,824 --> 00:07:48,760
We have the same duties and
problems in the army too.

116
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:51,763
You have yours and we have ours.
Look at that.

117
00:07:55,835 --> 00:07:58,770
So, you have the map.

118
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:02,774
That's your standpoint, right?
That's your point.

119
00:08:02,842 --> 00:08:05,777
But what you don't know...

120
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:09,781
is that some 2,000 girls
live in this area.

121
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:11,783
Girls without boyfriends.

122
00:08:12,852 --> 00:08:17,721
We've got 16 girls to
every boy here.

123
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:23,729
Girls are like rosebuds.
You get me?

124
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:26,731
That's youth.

125
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,733
And youth needs

126
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:31,736
what you used to need.
Comrade Major,...

127
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:35,740
and myself, and the
others too, see?

128
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,742
-In our youth.
-That's right.

129
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,745
So you have your opinion...
and all you have is a map,...

130
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:44,749
but I have the lives of all
those young people.

131
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,751
Think about it.

132
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,755
A girl works in the plant...

133
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:53,758
for eight hours at the machine.

134
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:56,761
She leaves the factory.

135
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:59,764
Then what? She gets something
to eat... right?

136
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:02,767
And then she has nobody
to caress her.

137
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:05,770
Nobody to kiss her.

138
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,776
So now think what happens if
there's no war for 50 years.

139
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:16,713
No war. which is what
we're all fighting for.

140
00:09:16,782 --> 00:09:21,719
Including yourself, Comrade Major.
You're fighting for the same thing.

141
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:24,722
What if there's no war
for a hundred years?

142
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,724
I can only tell you...

143
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:29,727
that I haven't said my
last word yet.

144
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:33,731
All can do is pass along
your proposal...

145
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,733
and we'll see what can be
done about it.

146
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:39,737
Pass it along? To whom?
What does that mean?

147
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:43,741
WELCOME THE PEOPLE'S ARMY

148
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:08,826
Battalion.

149
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:13,831
Follow me, company, three
men abreast. Line up.

150
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:24,776
All the fuss they made about it.

151
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:26,778
Yeah, and instead of boys,
we get reservists.

152
00:11:26,846 --> 00:11:29,781
And so good-looking. A bunch
of grandfathers.

153
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:32,784
Shout it out.
Left, right...

154
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:37,789
<i>Across the burnt earth
over bloody rivers</i>

155
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:41,793
<i>The vengeful regiments
march steadily on</i>

156
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:45,797
<i>Heart, law, eternity
are on our side</i>

157
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:49,801
<i>We march forward like time
Like a terrible wall of revenge</i>

158
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,805
<i>What a pretty daughter you have</i>

159
00:11:54,874 --> 00:12:02,804
<i>You know very well that
I have a crush on her</i>

160
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:09,811
<i>Hey, lady, give us your blessing</i>

161
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:16,761
<i>For she's a girl made for love</i>

162
00:12:49,862 --> 00:12:56,791
<i>What a pretty daughter you have</i>

163
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:05,800
<i>You know very well that
I have a crush on her</i>

164
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:35,773
Look at those soldiers
over there.

165
00:13:36,842 --> 00:13:39,777
Look at those girls
over there, man.

166
00:13:39,845 --> 00:13:43,781
Oh, God. Who are they?
They're terrible.

167
00:13:46,852 --> 00:13:49,787
-Why? Are they looking over here?
-Yeah. All the time.

168
00:13:49,855 --> 00:13:52,790
What if they ask us to dance?

169
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:54,792
Oh, come on.

170
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,794
What's your problem?

171
00:13:56,862 --> 00:13:58,796
Why couldn't it happen?
You're not ugly.

172
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:03,801
But come on, that's not possible.
No way could I...

173
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:05,803
Try it. Ask one of them
to dance.

174
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:07,805
Well, why not?

175
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:12,810
Look at them. This is just awful.
Let's get out of here.

176
00:14:12,878 --> 00:14:14,812
So let's not look
in their direction.

177
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,745
But we aren't looking their way.

178
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,750
Yes, you keep looking over there.

179
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,753
Please, Andula, stop
looking at them!

180
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,756
Where should I look? They're
sitting right there.

181
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,763
Look here, don't force
yourself on them.

182
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,766
Wait till they show same
interest.

183
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:37,767
What?

184
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,770
Don't be so pushy. Wait for
them to come over.

185
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,794
Handsome, isn't he?

186
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,797
The pianist. He's handsome,
isn't he?

187
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,802
So, boys?

188
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,744
-Damn it... so?
-What, what... so what.

189
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:21,746
Well, so... what?

190
00:15:21,814 --> 00:15:25,750
Gentlemen, we should send
them a bottle of wine.

191
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,752
Why?

192
00:15:30,823 --> 00:15:31,755
Why?

193
00:15:31,824 --> 00:15:33,758
Okay, then.

194
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:36,760
Sure, yeah.

195
00:15:59,852 --> 00:16:03,788
Look, girls, they're pointing at
us, and the waiter too.

196
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:05,790
Let them point. What
do we care?

197
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:08,793
-So don't look.
-Look at them looking at us.

198
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:10,795
They can look where they like.

199
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:13,798
You know, they'll think we're...

200
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:16,732
You're looking too.

201
00:16:16,802 --> 00:16:17,734
I'm not looking at them...

202
00:16:17,803 --> 00:16:19,737
We're not staring as
stupidly as you.

203
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:21,739
Stop it.

204
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:24,742
Look, he's taking it to
they table.

205
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:29,747
-Why doesn't he bring it to us first?
-Sit down and stop staring.

206
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:54,772
Jesus, what an idiot.

207
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:03,781
-This is embarrassing, man.
-That half-wit.

208
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:12,790
Don't look over there.

209
00:17:18,797 --> 00:17:21,732
At least stop smiling.

210
00:17:34,813 --> 00:17:37,748
-Really, girls, I'm so relieved...
-Me too.

211
00:17:37,816 --> 00:17:40,751
I was worried they were going
to bring the bottle to us.

212
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:44,755
-I couldn't bear it.
-Don't even mention it, please.

213
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:57,768
Hey, don't look over there now.

214
00:17:59,838 --> 00:18:01,772
Don't look there now!

215
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:23,727
-Let's get out of here, girls
-Yeah, we should go.

216
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:25,729
Courage!

217
00:18:30,802 --> 00:18:32,736
Let's go. Are we going?

218
00:18:36,808 --> 00:18:38,742
-So let's go. Come on!
-I'm not going.

219
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,744
You're crazy.

220
00:18:40,812 --> 00:18:44,748
We can't march over there
like a procession.

221
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:47,751
-So just the two of us?
-You two go.

222
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:49,753
Wait. What procession?

223
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:51,755
There's three of them and three
of us. Is that a procession?

224
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:53,757
Bring them over here.

225
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:55,759
Don't be crazy!

226
00:18:55,827 --> 00:18:57,761
So you bring them over, okay?

227
00:18:57,829 --> 00:18:59,763
Either the three of us go, or...

228
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:01,765
Why me alone?

229
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,768
So we'll all go, like I said.

230
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:06,770
-I'm not going.
-Now we look like bozos.

231
00:19:06,838 --> 00:19:07,770
Come on.

232
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:38,769
-Where can we go around here?
-An afternoon dance.

233
00:24:39,838 --> 00:24:41,772
Yeah, that's in the afternoon.

234
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,774
But when you don't want to sleep
yet, where do you go?

235
00:24:46,845 --> 00:24:48,779
To the park or to the woods.

236
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:53,784
Finish it off, then.
Come on.

237
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:57,788
-My God, how you hold it!
-Drink up.

238
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,791
It's much worse sipping
it like that.

239
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:03,794
Bottoms up! Have some
more, Jana.

240
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:06,797
-I can't.
-Yes, you can. You've hardly had any.

241
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:11,802
This is good stuff we ordered.
Wine is good for you, girls.

242
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,805
After all, when the
vine's growing,...

243
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,741
it draws nourishment from the soil.

244
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,744
All that iron and humidity
from the air...

245
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,746
and all that sun shining on it.

246
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,748
That's why it's so expensive.

247
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,751
Come on, have a drink.
All of it, like a man.

248
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,754
To the last drop.

249
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,757
See, you can do it.

250
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:35,759
There you go... all of it.

251
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,761
It was good, wasn't it?

252
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,764
Now you, Marie.

253
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,768
Bottoms up!

254
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:49,773
I don't want anymore.
I don't like it.

255
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:53,777
You'll get used to it. They
didn't like it either.

256
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:56,780
I don't want it.

257
00:26:01,853 --> 00:26:03,787
Shall we go for a walk?

258
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:07,791
Hey, what is this?

259
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:09,793
Keep playing.

260
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:12,796
It was fine.

261
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:20,737
Hey, you, come here. Yes, you.
Come here for a minute.

262
00:26:29,814 --> 00:26:32,749
-Oh, God, this is pointless.
-Let's go, okay?

263
00:26:32,817 --> 00:26:34,751
Let's just agree on something
an go.

264
00:26:34,819 --> 00:26:37,754
We'll drink the wine and
have some fun, huh?

265
00:26:38,823 --> 00:26:41,758
If you're not interested, we'll
go back to the barracks.

266
00:26:41,826 --> 00:26:44,761
We'll make it work, won't we?
Andula?

267
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:49,766
We can't stay here forever.
They're looking at us.

268
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:51,768
Are we going or not?

269
00:26:57,842 --> 00:26:59,776
We'll be back in a minute, okay?

270
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:06,783
Where are you going?

271
00:27:06,851 --> 00:27:08,785
We'll be right back.

272
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,735
I thought we could
talk a bit more...

273
00:27:24,803 --> 00:27:26,737
and then the time will be right.

274
00:27:26,805 --> 00:27:30,741
And then no problem. We'll
each will grab one and...

275
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:34,745
-I don't fell like going to the woods.
-They didn't really mean the woods.

276
00:27:34,813 --> 00:27:37,748
People just say,
"Let's go to the wood".

277
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:39,750
In this weather?

278
00:27:39,818 --> 00:27:42,753
They mean outdoors.
Not in a room.

279
00:27:42,821 --> 00:27:45,756
Did you think they'd let us
in their dormitory?

280
00:27:45,824 --> 00:27:48,759
No way, unless we pretend to
be an army delegation.

281
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:51,762
There's no way to get in there.

282
00:27:53,832 --> 00:27:58,769
Don't worry, you wouldn't be
the first to slip in there.

283
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:13,784
-Where're you going?
-I'm going to bed. There's nothing here.

284
00:28:13,852 --> 00:28:15,820
-Don't be stupid, man.
-What's going on here?

285
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,720
Sit down and quit being an idiot.

286
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,725
Listen, can I ask you something?

287
00:28:25,797 --> 00:28:27,731
Have you ever cheated
on your wife?

288
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:31,735
Why?

289
00:28:31,803 --> 00:28:33,737
Not "why"... yes or no?

290
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:40,744
Is this a pub or a confessional?

291
00:28:40,812 --> 00:28:45,749
Come on, say it. "I've been
unfaithful" or "I haven't".

292
00:28:45,817 --> 00:28:47,751
It's no big deal, right?

293
00:28:56,828 --> 00:28:58,762
Well, that's different.
Come on, let's go home.

294
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,765
-Don't be an idiot again.
-I'm not. He is.

295
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,767
Sit down. We still
have this bottle.

296
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:05,769
Now he's an idiot, huh?

297
00:29:05,837 --> 00:29:07,771
Go to hell and sit down,
and... just sit.

298
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,775
What a waste of money!

299
00:29:11,843 --> 00:29:13,777
Give him ten crowns.

300
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:16,712
Just take the money. I don't
care about the money.

301
00:29:16,781 --> 00:29:19,716
But I care that you sit here and
say nothing the whole time.

302
00:29:19,784 --> 00:29:21,718
Take the money and
leave me alone.

303
00:29:21,786 --> 00:29:23,720
Stop babbling now. You should
have spoken up before.

304
00:29:23,788 --> 00:29:25,722
You two stare like idiots,
while I do all the talking...

305
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,724
and now you tell me these
stupid things.

306
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:32,729
Gentlemen, this is
truly pointless.

307
00:29:32,797 --> 00:29:36,733
-Where are you going?
-Home. You act like children.

308
00:29:36,801 --> 00:29:38,735
You act like retarded teenagers.

309
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:40,737
-Let's go.
-This a waste of time.

310
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:43,740
Well, let's go. You wanted
to go. Come on.

311
00:29:47,812 --> 00:29:53,751
We'll go, but not because of me.

312
00:29:53,818 --> 00:29:57,754
-Good Lord.
-Because of whom, then?

313
00:29:57,822 --> 00:30:02,759
-Who was the first to get up?
-A bunch of idiots, aren't we?

314
00:30:02,827 --> 00:30:05,762
But still, they gave us
the bottle.

315
00:30:06,831 --> 00:30:09,766
Can't we just go and chat?

316
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:14,771
I'm not going. Those old geezers
will try to drag us to the woods.

317
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,776
-To the woods. Are you scared?
-Why would I be scared?

318
00:30:19,844 --> 00:30:22,779
You must be if you
say it like that.

319
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,785
Gentlemen, another minute
and I'm gone.

320
00:30:31,856 --> 00:30:34,791
-The girls probably left.
-Why would they?

321
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:38,795
-Because.
-Because why? Why would they leave?

322
00:30:39,864 --> 00:30:42,799
Would they sit with us all
evening to run off now?

323
00:30:42,867 --> 00:30:44,801
And how could they?
I kept an eye on the door.

324
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:49,806
-Go and take a look.
-Where?

325
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:51,808
Where they went.

326
00:30:51,876 --> 00:30:54,811
-I can go and have a look?
-Why not?

327
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:56,813
-Why not?
-Why can't you go there?

328
00:30:56,881 --> 00:30:59,816
You'd go to their dormitory but
you're scared to go there?

329
00:30:59,884 --> 00:31:03,820
There's a difference between a
ladies room and a dormitory.

330
00:31:08,893 --> 00:31:14,832
-So you go.
-I'll do, but we're wasting a bottle.

331
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:18,767
See, he can't forget the bottle.
Who do you think you are?

332
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:23,773
Look at us. A bunch of old farts.
We have to pay the price.

333
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:27,777
You only get it for free at home, and
in your case I doubt even that.

334
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:41,791
Really, do you want to
come up for a while?

335
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,793
I trust you.

336
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:46,796
I could make you tea or something.
Would you like that?

337
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,798
-I trust you but...
-But I don't trust you. See...

338
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,801
-Why?
-Don't tell me you're just chatting.

339
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:53,803
I mean it. We're just
chatting with them.

340
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,805
-You're not.
-We are too.

341
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:58,808
I'm going right now.

342
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,810
-Come up, just for a while.
-No.

343
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,813
Just to chat, I promise.

344
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,815
No. I have to go.

345
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:07,817
-Come up, just for a moment!
-No.

346
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,820
Wait. At least let me read
your palm, all right?

347
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,823
Gentlemen, what's going on?
Hey, look at this.

348
00:32:16,828 --> 00:32:18,762
Drink up.

349
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:21,765
You too. All of it.

350
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:26,770
You're no better than the
girls. Drink up.

351
00:32:26,838 --> 00:32:28,772
Take the bottle.

352
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:32,776
Off we go, gentlemen.

353
00:32:32,844 --> 00:32:35,779
Don't drink it all. You'll fall
asleep in the woods.

354
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:37,780
Let's go.

355
00:32:44,856 --> 00:32:47,791
Finally. Where is Andula?

356
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:49,793
-Over there. She'll be here.
-Will she?

357
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:51,795
Where is she?

358
00:32:51,863 --> 00:32:53,797
Where are you going?

359
00:32:54,866 --> 00:32:56,800
What is it?

360
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:03,807
Boys, I'm off to bed.
Good night, girls.

361
00:33:05,877 --> 00:33:06,809
Oh, come on.

362
00:33:18,823 --> 00:33:21,758
Girls, what's this whispering?

363
00:33:23,828 --> 00:33:25,762
Say it out loud.

364
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:29,766
-We're going too. Good night.
-Good night.

365
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:31,768
-Go, then.
-So let's go.

366
00:33:33,838 --> 00:33:37,774
-Come on, then.
-Go, then. The both of you.

367
00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:40,777
Come on. Please, come on.

368
00:33:51,856 --> 00:33:56,793
This is the line of your...This is
your line. And here you see...

369
00:33:56,861 --> 00:33:59,796
-What line?
-Your life line.

370
00:34:00,865 --> 00:34:03,800
And here...I see danger.

371
00:34:03,868 --> 00:34:08,805
I see three middle-aged
men in the woods.

372
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:11,808
It says here, three men in
the woods, in winter.

373
00:34:11,876 --> 00:34:14,811
-You mean the there downstairs?
-I didn't say that.

374
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,747
Well, I'm not sure. Sometime in
the near future.

375
00:34:18,816 --> 00:34:21,751
Damn it, but you have
a long life line!

376
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:23,753
Yes, it goes up here.

377
00:34:24,822 --> 00:34:28,758
-And here you have a scar.
-That's nothing.

378
00:34:28,826 --> 00:34:31,761
I have a scar too.
I fell out of a tree.

379
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:35,765
-This isn't from a tree.
-It's not?

380
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:40,770
A rock then?
A piece of glass?

381
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,774
It's from a razor blade.

382
00:34:44,842 --> 00:34:47,777
You tried to commit suicide?

383
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:54,785
Because of my mom.
We don't get along.

384
00:34:54,852 --> 00:34:57,787
Let's go to my room and you
can tell me everything.

385
00:34:57,855 --> 00:35:02,792
-No. I've got to go.
-It was because of your mom?

386
00:35:04,862 --> 00:35:10,801
I only got along with my dad.
They're divorced now.

387
00:35:10,868 --> 00:35:12,802
-Come with me.
-No.

388
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,840
-Mine are divorced too.
-I have to go.

389
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,741
How did it happen?
You cut your...

390
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:21,744
Well, I thought the
artery, you know?

391
00:35:21,812 --> 00:35:24,747
I thought it was the light vein.

392
00:35:24,815 --> 00:35:29,752
I took a razor blade and it broke,
so I took another one.

393
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,754
I just kept cutting.

394
00:35:32,823 --> 00:35:35,758
And I was crying.

395
00:35:35,826 --> 00:35:40,763
-And the blood...
-Come, let's go to my room.

396
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:45,768
-No. I have to go.
-Look, I have another scar here.

397
00:35:45,836 --> 00:35:48,771
-No. I have to go. Really.
-Come on.

398
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,767
Take off your coat.

399
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:52,769
No, I'm not taking
off anything.

400
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:54,771
Won't you sit down
for a minute?

401
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,773
-No, I'm not taking anything off.
-Why not?

402
00:36:56,841 --> 00:37:02,780
I came up here so you wouldn't
think I didn't trust you.

403
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:10,787
Can I tell you something?
Then you can go.

404
00:37:15,826 --> 00:37:19,728
No. What's the point?
What's the use?

405
00:37:20,798 --> 00:37:23,733
Come on, tell me.

406
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:26,736
There's no use. You want to
go and there's no time...

407
00:37:26,804 --> 00:37:28,738
and I need you to sit down...

408
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:32,742
so we can talk a bit.

409
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,744
So tell me.

410
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:39,749
All right, I'll tell you.

411
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:47,757
Come here.

412
00:37:53,831 --> 00:37:55,765
What are you doing?

413
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:58,768
Why are you scared?

414
00:37:58,836 --> 00:38:00,770
Can't you fight?
Can't you?

415
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:05,775
So that's why you're scared.
Let me teach you something...

416
00:38:05,843 --> 00:38:09,779
to stop you from being scared when
someone's bothering you.

417
00:38:09,847 --> 00:38:11,781
It's a grip. May I?

418
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,820
Stand here like this.

419
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,721
Take that off. We might wrinkle it.

420
00:38:23,794 --> 00:38:27,730
If someone starts bothering you,
like this for example.

421
00:38:27,798 --> 00:38:29,732
Don't be scared.

422
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,734
I don't want to do anything.
That was just an example.

423
00:38:31,802 --> 00:38:33,736
Don't be scared. Put your
arms around me.

424
00:38:33,804 --> 00:38:36,739
-Now, what do I see?
-How would I know?

425
00:38:36,807 --> 00:38:38,741
-Well, what do I see?
-I don't know.

426
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:41,744
That's just the thing. Now
I can't see anything...

427
00:38:41,812 --> 00:38:43,746
and that's your ideal opportunity
to defend yourself.

428
00:38:43,814 --> 00:38:46,749
-How?
-With your legs.

429
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:49,752
Don't be afraid.

430
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,754
-How will you defend yourself?
-I don't know.

431
00:38:51,822 --> 00:38:53,756
With your legs.

432
00:38:53,824 --> 00:38:55,758
And how?

433
00:38:56,827 --> 00:38:58,761
-Kick me.
-Where?

434
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,765
You can either give me a
kick with your knee...

435
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,767
but I'm not going to try that...

436
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:08,771
or you can kick me
in the shin, see?

437
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:13,776
-So, I'm bothering you.
-But it'll hurt you, won't it?

438
00:39:13,844 --> 00:39:17,712
Look here, you'd better
take your shoes off.

439
00:39:17,782 --> 00:39:20,717
Come on, take them off
for a minute.

440
00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:26,723
Now kick me.

441
00:39:29,794 --> 00:39:31,728
Nice trick, eh?

442
00:39:31,796 --> 00:39:35,732
-You said I should kick you.
-Yes, in the shin.

443
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,734
Now, defend yourself.

444
00:39:37,802 --> 00:39:40,737
I'll teach you a counter grip.

445
00:39:40,805 --> 00:39:41,737
Come on.

446
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:47,744
-Kick me in the shin.
-I can't.

447
00:39:51,816 --> 00:39:53,750
I overdid it.

448
00:40:04,829 --> 00:40:06,763
Does it hurt really bad?

449
00:40:07,832 --> 00:40:10,767
You know, I could get
gangrene and die.

450
00:40:11,836 --> 00:40:17,775
-You want me to die?
-No.

451
00:40:20,845 --> 00:40:22,779
So why did you kick
me like that?

452
00:40:26,851 --> 00:40:28,785
I forgive you.

453
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:55,805
Turn off the light, please.

454
00:43:43,847 --> 00:43:45,781
I can't find you.

455
00:44:03,867 --> 00:44:05,801
But I don't trust you.

456
00:44:23,821 --> 00:44:25,755
I do trust you.

457
00:44:28,826 --> 00:44:31,761
I've never trusted anyone
so much before.

458
00:44:38,836 --> 00:44:42,772
-I told you at least a hundred times.
-No, you didn't.

459
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,775
-Didn't I?
-No, you didn't.

460
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:56,786
I don't have a girl in Prague,
I don't have a girl in Prague...

461
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:03,793
Stop it. That's enough.

462
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:23,746
-Shit, you'll choke me.
-So what?

463
00:45:23,814 --> 00:45:27,750
-I won't be able to finish.
-Finish what?

464
00:45:27,818 --> 00:45:31,754
Finish saying "I don't have a girl
in Prague, I don't have..."

465
00:45:37,828 --> 00:45:40,763
Let me see. Who gave that to you?

466
00:45:41,832 --> 00:45:45,768
-It's from my mom.
-Your mom?

467
00:45:46,837 --> 00:45:50,773
-You have a ring too.
-I got mine from my mom too.

468
00:45:50,841 --> 00:45:53,776
We both have rings
from our mothers.

469
00:45:57,848 --> 00:45:59,782
Why did you say I was angular?

470
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:03,786
-I said you were angular?
-Yes, you did.

471
00:46:04,855 --> 00:46:08,791
-Well, because you're angular.
-What do you mean?

472
00:46:11,862 --> 00:46:17,732
Some women are round,
like guitar, like this.

473
00:46:18,802 --> 00:46:24,741
And you...look like a guitar too,
but one made by Picasso.

474
00:46:24,808 --> 00:46:26,742
What's that?

475
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,744
A painter.

476
00:46:30,814 --> 00:46:32,748
When painting a woman,...

477
00:46:34,818 --> 00:46:40,757
he painted her eye here...

478
00:46:40,824 --> 00:46:45,761
and her leg somewhere else.

479
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:53,769
I could tell you about
lots of other pictures.

480
00:47:00,844 --> 00:47:03,779
Or he painted fingers like this.

481
00:47:03,847 --> 00:47:06,782
-That's weird.
-Weird, yeah.

482
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:09,785
But I'm not like that?

483
00:47:11,855 --> 00:47:12,787
No.

484
00:47:13,857 --> 00:47:17,725
-Is that good or bad?
-What?

485
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:21,730
That I am like the Picasso guitar?

486
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:23,732
Well, that's good.

487
00:48:58,829 --> 00:49:00,763
-Hi.
-Hi.

488
00:50:24,848 --> 00:50:26,782
-Hi.
-Hi.

489
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,784
-Show me your hand.
-Why?

490
00:50:28,852 --> 00:50:30,786
-Just show me your hand.
-Why?

491
00:50:30,854 --> 00:50:33,789
-Where is your ring?
-I don't wear it anymore.

492
00:50:33,857 --> 00:50:35,791
You don't wear it.
Where is it?

493
00:50:37,861 --> 00:50:40,796
-I don't wear it.
-You don't wear it. Where is it?

494
00:50:40,864 --> 00:50:43,799
Well, you didn't show up for
over a month, so there.

495
00:50:43,867 --> 00:50:47,803
So I didn't show up for a
month. Where is the ring.

496
00:50:48,872 --> 00:50:53,809
-It's mine, isn't it?
-So what if it's your?

497
00:50:55,879 --> 00:50:59,815
Where is the ring?

498
00:51:01,885 --> 00:51:03,819
Where is it?

499
00:51:03,887 --> 00:51:05,821
-At the dormitory.
-Then get on and we'll go get it.

500
00:51:29,846 --> 00:51:30,778
Tonda.

501
00:51:30,847 --> 00:51:34,783
Andula says she can't
give you the ring.

502
00:51:34,851 --> 00:51:38,787
-Why not?
-Because she doesn't have it.

503
00:51:38,855 --> 00:51:41,790
-Doesn't have it?
-Ask Andula to come to the window.

504
00:51:50,867 --> 00:51:55,804
-What do you need it for?
-Hey get lost. Call her.

505
00:52:05,882 --> 00:52:09,818
-Andula says she can't come.
-How come?

506
00:52:09,886 --> 00:52:11,820
She doesn't have time.

507
00:52:38,848 --> 00:52:41,783
Get out. what do you want?

508
00:52:41,851 --> 00:52:44,786
-Come here.
-Please, go away. Out.

509
00:52:44,854 --> 00:52:48,790
-What are you doing?
-Don't be scared. Stand up.

510
00:52:48,858 --> 00:52:51,793
Please. Go away.

511
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:55,797
What are you doing?
What is it?

512
00:52:55,865 --> 00:52:57,799
Don't be scared.
Stop shouting, okay?

513
00:53:01,871 --> 00:53:04,806
What are you doing?
Get out!

514
00:53:04,874 --> 00:53:08,810
-This is my business, not yours!
-It's our business too. Get out!

515
00:53:08,878 --> 00:53:11,813
She's our friend and this
is our room. Shut up.

516
00:53:11,881 --> 00:53:16,750
Get up.
Do you hear me?

517
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:19,755
Get up.

518
00:53:19,823 --> 00:53:22,758
Why are you staring at me?

519
00:53:23,827 --> 00:53:25,761
Get up.

520
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:32,768
Don't touch me. You're disgusting!
You hear me?

521
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,775
You're disgusting,
like a beast.

522
00:53:42,846 --> 00:53:44,780
Go away, please!

523
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:52,788
Go away. I don't want to
see you anymore.

524
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:57,793
<i>Girls, look.</i>

525
00:53:58,862 --> 00:54:04,801
A girl's honor isn't just talk.
It really exists.

526
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:08,804
If you keep treating it
the way you do,...

527
00:54:08,872 --> 00:54:13,809
don't be surprised if boys
treat you badly.

528
00:54:14,878 --> 00:54:19,747
If you go out with a different boy
every day, they talk about it.

529
00:54:21,818 --> 00:54:24,753
Your whole life lies
ahead of you.

530
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:26,755
You want to be happy.

531
00:54:26,823 --> 00:54:31,760
You want to marry a good boy...

532
00:54:31,828 --> 00:54:35,764
who will love you forever.

533
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:39,768
But you have to deserve it.

534
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:44,773
Think about it.

535
00:54:45,842 --> 00:54:49,778
I think you should be looking
for a solution.

536
00:54:55,852 --> 00:55:00,789
Girls, I think the words of
comrade teacher here...

537
00:55:01,858 --> 00:55:04,793
give us much to reflect on.

538
00:55:05,862 --> 00:55:10,799
This deserves a pledge
from each of us,...

539
00:55:11,868 --> 00:55:14,803
a promise to improve ourselves.

540
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:23,745
I think we should vote on it.

541
00:55:25,815 --> 00:55:27,749
Who's in favor?

542
00:55:31,821 --> 00:55:32,753
Thank you.

543
00:55:32,822 --> 00:55:34,756
Who's against?

544
00:55:38,828 --> 00:55:39,760
Thank you.

545
00:55:39,829 --> 00:55:41,763
Any abstentions?

546
00:56:07,857 --> 00:56:10,792
Are you going to Prague?

547
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:54,770
<i>Across the meadows ringing
Yippiyippiyee</i>

548
00:56:54,838 --> 00:56:59,775
<i>The echo for me singing
Yippiyippiyee</i>

549
00:56:59,843 --> 00:57:05,782
<i>When over the valley
for is rolling</i>

550
00:57:05,849 --> 00:57:09,785
<i>The boys are riding home</i>

551
00:57:11,855 --> 00:57:16,724
<i>When Jimmy moments the saddle
my heart goes shivering</i>

552
00:57:16,793 --> 00:57:22,732
<i>I can see the rider afar
flying away on his horse</i>

553
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:27,736
<i>Disappearing behind the rock
waving at me</i>

554
00:57:27,804 --> 00:57:31,740
<i>Jimmy boy, I wanna join you</i>

555
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:36,745
<i>When across the meadow ringing</i>

556
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:43,752
<i>The echo for me singing</i>

557
00:57:45,822 --> 00:57:49,758
<i>When over the valley
fog is rolling</i>

558
00:57:49,826 --> 00:57:53,762
<i>the boys are riding home</i>

559
00:58:36,806 --> 00:58:40,742
Poppa.

560
00:58:44,814 --> 00:58:46,748
-What is it?
-The doorbell.

561
00:58:47,817 --> 00:58:51,753
Who would ring the bell?
It must have been on TV.

562
00:59:16,779 --> 00:59:19,714
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

563
00:59:19,782 --> 00:59:22,717
Does Milda Vasita live
here, please?

564
00:59:22,785 --> 00:59:25,720
He does. You have
business with him?

565
00:59:25,788 --> 00:59:27,722
-Is he home?
-No, he's not.

566
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:30,725
What do you want?

567
00:59:31,794 --> 00:59:33,728
Do you know when
he'll back?

568
00:59:33,796 --> 00:59:39,735
I really don't. Sometimes early,
sometimes late.

569
00:59:39,802 --> 00:59:42,737
Do you know where
I could find him?

570
00:59:42,805 --> 00:59:46,741
-Gosh, I don't. Momma?
-What is it?

571
00:59:46,809 --> 00:59:49,744
Do you know when Milda is due
home or where he's playing?

572
00:59:49,812 --> 00:59:53,748
I don't. He didn't say where he was
going or when he'd be back.

573
00:59:55,818 --> 00:59:59,754
Hard to say. You should maybe try
and find him on your own.

574
01:00:02,825 --> 01:00:05,760
-May I leave my suitcase here, please?
-Sure.

575
01:00:05,828 --> 01:00:07,762
-Thank you. Good-bye.
-Good night.

576
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:30,785
Poppa who was it?

577
01:00:50,873 --> 01:00:52,807
Incredible!

578
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:56,811
She shows up late at night
at his parents place.

579
01:00:56,879 --> 01:01:00,815
Did Milda say he was
expecting her?

580
01:01:00,883 --> 01:01:03,818
I asked nothing and he
offered nothing.

581
01:01:06,889 --> 01:01:09,824
I can't get it off my mind.

582
01:01:12,895 --> 01:01:14,829
With a suitcase.

583
01:01:14,897 --> 01:01:18,765
-Was she young?
-Yes, she was young.

584
01:01:19,836 --> 01:01:23,772
I didn't even know he
was going steady.

585
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,775
Yeah, like the boy is going to
tell you about his girl friends!

586
01:01:31,848 --> 01:01:34,783
Will you stop watching that TV?

587
01:01:35,852 --> 01:01:38,787
I can't stop thinking about it.

588
01:01:38,855 --> 01:01:43,792
I can't do anything. I can't even
sew. Can't get it off my mind.

589
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:45,794
I'm worried about him.

590
01:01:48,865 --> 01:01:52,801
This is no small matter. Finds
himself a girl God knows where.

591
01:01:52,869 --> 01:01:54,803
Did she tell you where
she lived?

592
01:01:54,871 --> 01:01:57,806
I didn't ask.

593
01:01:57,874 --> 01:02:01,810
He'll end up having to marry her, and
we don't even know where she's from.

594
01:02:01,878 --> 01:02:05,814
You know what happens
with marriages like that.

595
01:02:05,882 --> 01:02:07,816
Six months later it's over.

596
01:02:07,884 --> 01:02:11,820
And the Kids are the
ones who suffer.

597
01:02:11,888 --> 01:02:15,858
He hasn't mentioned marriage and
you're worried about the Kids!

598
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:18,759
Don't make such a fuss about it.

599
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:21,763
This is awful.

600
01:02:22,832 --> 01:02:25,767
Poppa, have a look in
her suitcase.

601
01:02:25,835 --> 01:02:29,771
Are you crazy? Open a strange
woman's suitcase?

602
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,775
We might find out something
about her.

603
01:02:34,844 --> 01:02:36,778
Yeah, the suitcase will
tell you for sure.

604
01:02:36,846 --> 01:02:39,781
It's her you should have looked
at, not her suitcase!

605
01:02:39,849 --> 01:02:42,784
I didn't speak to her you did.

606
01:02:42,852 --> 01:02:47,789
Who am I to probe into
her personal life?

607
01:02:47,857 --> 01:02:50,792
You could have taken
a close look.

608
01:02:51,861 --> 01:02:55,797
I did, but I didn't see anything.
What was I supposed to see?

609
01:02:57,867 --> 01:03:00,802
Who knows how this
will turn out?

610
01:03:02,872 --> 01:03:05,807
There's the doorbell again.

611
01:03:16,819 --> 01:03:21,756
Excuse me they locked the front
door. Could you please...

612
01:03:22,825 --> 01:03:25,760
Could you open the door for me?

613
01:03:25,828 --> 01:03:28,763
Wait a second. I'll get the key.

614
01:03:31,834 --> 01:03:33,768
<i>Poppa who is it?</i>

615
01:03:34,837 --> 01:03:37,772
<i>It's the girl.</i>

616
01:03:40,843 --> 01:03:45,780
Miss, wait a second.
Don't run away.

617
01:03:45,848 --> 01:03:49,784
Don't run. Come in for a minute.
I'd like to ask something.

618
01:03:49,852 --> 01:03:52,787
-Come in for a while.
-No, I'd rather go.

619
01:03:52,855 --> 01:03:55,790
Don't be scared. I won't hurt you.
Come in for a while.

620
01:03:55,858 --> 01:03:58,793
I just want to ask
you something.

621
01:03:59,862 --> 01:04:01,796
Please come in.

622
01:04:08,871 --> 01:04:10,805
Take off your coat.

623
01:04:15,845 --> 01:04:17,745
Here's my hat.

624
01:04:22,818 --> 01:04:24,752
Sit over there.

625
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:31,759
Have a seat.

626
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:33,761
Sit down, young lady.

627
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,764
Don't be shy.

628
01:04:41,837 --> 01:04:47,776
Did you arrange something
with Milda?

629
01:04:47,843 --> 01:04:49,777
He invited me to come.

630
01:04:49,845 --> 01:04:54,782
But I couldn't come sooner.
I work, you know.

631
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:59,787
How come he didn't say anything
about your coming?

632
01:04:59,855 --> 01:05:03,791
Poppa, he didn't say
a word, did he?

633
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:06,794
No, but I didn't speak
with him.

634
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:11,799
You see? And now you show up with
a suitcase to spend the night?

635
01:05:12,868 --> 01:05:17,737
-Where did you meet him?
-Back home in Zruc.

636
01:05:17,807 --> 01:05:21,743
You came from Zruc?
And you met him there?

637
01:05:22,812 --> 01:05:27,749
-Has Milda been to Zruc?
-Yes, about a week ago.

638
01:05:29,819 --> 01:05:32,754
And you've only known each other
for such a short time?

639
01:05:32,822 --> 01:05:34,756
Yes, Saturday and Sunday.

640
01:05:39,829 --> 01:05:45,768
You see, Milda charms a girl, invites
her home and now what?

641
01:05:45,835 --> 01:05:47,769
Crazy guy.

642
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:52,774
He is. But it's partly
her fault too.

643
01:05:52,842 --> 01:05:56,778
She shouldn't jump when a
boy invites her to visit.

644
01:05:56,846 --> 01:05:59,781
And she comes to his parents' place
for the night, with a suitcase.

645
01:05:59,849 --> 01:06:01,783
-You have a serious reason to come?
-No.

646
01:06:03,853 --> 01:06:07,789
Just what did you think, showing
up with a suitcase?

647
01:06:07,857 --> 01:06:09,791
Where did you plan to
spend the night?

648
01:06:11,861 --> 01:06:13,795
I don't know yet.

649
01:06:14,864 --> 01:06:18,732
-Where did you plan to sleep?
-I don't know.

650
01:06:19,802 --> 01:06:22,737
Well, it wasn't very smart...

651
01:06:22,805 --> 01:06:28,744
to set off a boy's parents' if you've
only known him for two days.

652
01:06:28,811 --> 01:06:32,747
He didn't mean it. He just said,
"Come and see me."

653
01:06:32,815 --> 01:06:35,750
She took him at his word,
and here she is.

654
01:06:35,818 --> 01:06:38,753
For haven sake,
she's a young girl.

655
01:06:39,822 --> 01:06:44,759
I still don't get it. Where were
you going to sleep?

656
01:06:48,831 --> 01:06:51,766
You can't stay here with us.

657
01:06:52,835 --> 01:06:54,769
Poppa, what do you say?

658
01:06:54,837 --> 01:06:59,774
If he invited her, we'll look after
her until he gets home.

659
01:06:59,842 --> 01:07:04,779
We're not gonna throw her out.
We'll make room for he.

660
01:07:04,847 --> 01:07:07,782
You keep out of it.
That won't work.

661
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:09,784
What would people say?

662
01:07:11,854 --> 01:07:17,724
A girl comes to see Milda and
we let her stay the night?

663
01:07:17,793 --> 01:07:19,727
I don't care.

664
01:07:19,795 --> 01:07:21,729
Would you kick her out
on the street?

665
01:07:21,797 --> 01:07:23,731
Keep out of this.

666
01:07:23,799 --> 01:07:28,736
I don't know how we'll handle
this. I don't like it.

667
01:07:36,812 --> 01:07:40,748
Haven't I always said
your son is nuts?

668
01:07:40,816 --> 01:07:42,750
Here's your proof.

669
01:07:42,818 --> 01:07:45,753
You could have talked to him.

670
01:07:45,821 --> 01:07:49,757
You could have told him not
to do such stupid things.

671
01:07:49,825 --> 01:07:51,759
He's never done this
before has he?

672
01:07:52,828 --> 01:07:55,763
He isn't old enough
to do such things.

673
01:07:55,831 --> 01:07:57,765
Well, that's true.

674
01:07:57,833 --> 01:08:00,768
We didn't do thing like this.

675
01:08:01,837 --> 01:08:06,774
You're making such a fuss about it.
Nothing happened, right?

676
01:08:07,843 --> 01:08:12,780
We'll fix up a bed for her.
We can't throw her out.

677
01:08:12,848 --> 01:08:15,818
He's an idiot and we can't
do a thing about it.

678
01:08:15,818 --> 01:08:17,718
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

679
01:08:18,787 --> 01:08:21,722
Too late now. He should have
know better before.

680
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:26,727
Was I supposed to tell him before?
Did I know she was coming?

681
01:08:26,795 --> 01:08:29,730
He should know not to do
such stupid things.

682
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:33,734
He'll keep telling young
girls to come visit...

683
01:08:33,802 --> 01:08:36,737
and a few days later they'll
show up on our doorstep.

684
01:08:37,806 --> 01:08:40,741
This won't be the last time.

685
01:08:40,809 --> 01:08:44,745
You think I'm with him all the time
to know what he tells girls?

686
01:08:44,813 --> 01:08:47,748
You think that in the old days...

687
01:08:47,816 --> 01:08:50,751
I could pack a suitcase and
leave for a boy's parents'?

688
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:52,753
Do you know what that meant?

689
01:08:52,821 --> 01:08:56,757
Should she have come from the
country without a suitcase?

690
01:08:57,826 --> 01:09:01,762
You came here instead going
to your own parents'.

691
01:09:02,831 --> 01:09:05,766
You've put us in quite a fix.

692
01:09:05,834 --> 01:09:07,768
I've no idea what to do.

693
01:09:40,803 --> 01:09:44,739
Now, look at Milda. True, he
makes quite a bit of money.

694
01:09:44,807 --> 01:09:48,743
He could handle a marriage financially,
but there's more to it than that.

695
01:09:48,811 --> 01:09:53,748
He need a woman to look after
him, to cook for him.

696
01:09:55,818 --> 01:09:59,754
He brings in the money, but
look at Poppa here.

697
01:09:59,822 --> 01:10:04,759
He's been working for 30 years and
doesn't earn as much as Milda does.

698
01:10:05,828 --> 01:10:08,763
Look how worn-out he is,
the poor guy.

699
01:14:04,867 --> 01:14:06,801
Who's sleeping here?

700
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:11,806
You're asking me? It's a girl...
can't you see?

701
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:14,809
Where from?

702
01:14:15,844 --> 01:14:19,746
Don't play stupid. She's come
to see you, boy.

703
01:14:19,815 --> 01:14:22,750
-To see me?
-No, me!

704
01:14:22,818 --> 01:14:27,755
-Who is she?
-Who is she? Look at her.

705
01:14:27,823 --> 01:14:30,758
Should I recognize her by
her foot or what?

706
01:14:30,826 --> 01:14:32,760
-So turn her over.
-How? She's asleep.

707
01:14:32,828 --> 01:14:35,763
-You're a real idiot.
-Who invited her?

708
01:14:35,831 --> 01:14:39,767
-You must have.
-I'm telling you, I don't know.

709
01:14:39,835 --> 01:14:43,771
Jesus, a girl wouldn't just come
to our place for the fun of it.

710
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:47,775
-You're saying I invited her?
-Stop yelling at me.

711
01:14:47,843 --> 01:14:53,782
Shut your mouth. A girl comes to
see you and you yell at me.

712
01:14:53,849 --> 01:14:55,783
You should know
where she's from.

713
01:14:55,851 --> 01:14:58,786
I don't. She must've
told you.

714
01:14:58,854 --> 01:15:01,789
She met you in Zruc.
Did you play there?

715
01:15:01,857 --> 01:15:03,791
She couldn't have been
there with me.

716
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:09,797
Listen, this is the last time. Once
more and you're out of the house.

717
01:15:09,865 --> 01:15:12,800
Are you sure she's
not a relative?

718
01:15:12,868 --> 01:15:14,802
Am I that stupid?

719
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:17,737
You think I wouldn't recognize
our own relatives?

720
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:19,740
Don't treat me like an idiot.

721
01:15:19,808 --> 01:15:21,742
Honestly. Dad, I don't
invite her here.

722
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:25,746
Don't you think I would have told
you and Mom if I had?

723
01:15:25,814 --> 01:15:31,753
-Lord, don't make a fool out of me.
-What should I do? Throw her out?

724
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:33,754
-Throw her out.
-Okay, I will!

725
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:43,764
Oh, my gosh! Hi!

726
01:15:43,832 --> 01:15:45,766
I didn't recognize you.

727
01:15:46,835 --> 01:15:48,769
-Hi.
-Hi.

728
01:15:48,837 --> 01:15:51,772
I didn't recognize your hair.

729
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,775
I didn't know it was you.

730
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:59,780
-What was your father saying?
-Nothing.

731
01:15:59,848 --> 01:16:02,783
-He said something.
-He's stupid.

732
01:16:05,854 --> 01:16:09,790
-Are you glad I came?
-You know I am.

733
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:15,796
And when... How long do
you plan to stay?

734
01:16:26,808 --> 01:16:29,743
It's hard, you know.

735
01:16:29,811 --> 01:16:31,745
You don't write a single line,
you show up,...

736
01:16:31,813 --> 01:16:34,748
and my folks are alarmed.
You can't do that.

737
01:16:36,818 --> 01:16:40,754
-So now you know her, eh?
-Yes, he does.

738
01:16:51,833 --> 01:16:53,767
Why didn't you write?

739
01:16:54,836 --> 01:16:58,772
I wanted to, but somehow
I never had time.

740
01:17:01,843 --> 01:17:05,779
-What did he say?
-That he doesn't know her.

741
01:17:05,847 --> 01:17:10,784
-What else?
-That he never asked her to come.

742
01:17:10,852 --> 01:17:13,787
-Now go to sleep.
-But you had a long talk.

743
01:17:14,856 --> 01:17:17,723
Yes, we talked a long time.

744
01:17:17,793 --> 01:17:20,728
I have to talk to him
from time to time.

745
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,735
-Where have you been?
-Playing.

746
01:17:27,803 --> 01:17:29,737
And then?

747
01:17:30,806 --> 01:17:33,741
Then we went someplace.

748
01:17:36,812 --> 01:17:38,746
-Alone?
-No.

749
01:17:41,817 --> 01:17:43,751
With whom?

750
01:17:43,819 --> 01:17:45,753
-What?
-With whom?

751
01:17:45,821 --> 01:17:47,755
The guys.

752
01:17:48,824 --> 01:17:52,760
-Who else?
-Just the guys.

753
01:17:55,831 --> 01:17:58,766
This is terrible.
This won't do at all.

754
01:17:59,835 --> 01:18:01,769
You'd like that, wouldn't
you, miss?

755
01:18:01,837 --> 01:18:03,771
But you wouldn't get much
sleep here. Come on.

756
01:18:03,839 --> 01:18:05,773
And don't argue with me.

757
01:18:05,841 --> 01:18:09,777
You'll sleep in our bed.
That'll be better.

758
01:18:09,845 --> 01:18:12,780
-Don't push me, damn it. I'm going.
-Go.

759
01:18:12,848 --> 01:18:15,783
I can keep an eye on you.

760
01:18:34,803 --> 01:18:39,740
-I can't sleep here at all.
-You'll sleep here just fine.

761
01:18:40,809 --> 01:18:43,744
It's like sleeping on the
edge a table!

762
01:18:44,813 --> 01:18:47,748
It's not my fault. Where
should I have put him?

763
01:18:47,816 --> 01:18:51,752
-I could have sleep out there.
-You think I'd let you?

764
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:56,757
-What's gonna happen?
-Sleep with a girl at home? No, sir.

765
01:18:56,825 --> 01:18:59,760
Poppa will survive.

766
01:18:59,828 --> 01:19:04,765
He stinks like a barrel.
Don't breathe on me.

767
01:19:05,834 --> 01:19:07,768
This is terrible.

768
01:19:08,837 --> 01:19:10,771
Give me some blankets.

769
01:19:10,839 --> 01:19:14,775
If you were a decent father, you'd
slap him for coming in so late!

770
01:19:14,843 --> 01:19:17,710
-He wouldn't come in this late...
-Jesus, listen...

771
01:19:17,779 --> 01:19:20,714
I'll get under the covers
and that's that.

772
01:19:21,783 --> 01:19:24,718
No way. And don't do
this ever again.

773
01:19:24,786 --> 01:19:28,722
-For a girl...
-It's not my fault. Is it?

774
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:32,726
Yes, it is. You've ruined my evening.
You asked her to come.

775
01:19:32,794 --> 01:19:35,729
You know very well I didn't
ask her to come.

776
01:19:35,797 --> 01:19:37,731
-She wouldn't lie.
-Oh, please.

777
01:19:37,799 --> 01:19:39,733
I'm going out there.

778
01:19:39,801 --> 01:19:43,737
<i>Don't you dare or
I'll slap you, too!</i>

779
01:19:43,805 --> 01:19:47,741
<i>Damn it, will you
stop yelling?</i>

780
01:19:47,809 --> 01:19:50,744
<i>How should I know what
I did or didn't do?</i>

781
01:19:50,812 --> 01:19:53,747
Very nice! So what do you do
when you go out on tour?

782
01:19:53,815 --> 01:19:55,749
I play.

783
01:19:55,817 --> 01:19:58,752
So how come you don't
know what you did?

784
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:00,754
-Do you get that drunk?
-Stop barking. For goodness' sake.

785
01:20:00,822 --> 01:20:02,756
<i>I have to tell him.</i>

786
01:20:02,824 --> 01:20:04,758
<i>Then tell him later.</i>

787
01:20:04,826 --> 01:20:09,763
But he still deserves a few
good slaps from you.

788
01:20:09,831 --> 01:20:14,768
You come over here. I'll sleep
here and we're all set.

789
01:20:14,836 --> 01:20:16,770
Do whatever you want.

790
01:20:16,838 --> 01:20:18,772
Don't stretch out or I'll
smack you one!

791
01:20:20,842 --> 01:20:22,776
That's much better.

792
01:20:24,846 --> 01:20:28,782
-Why do you do these stupid things?
-I haven't done anything stupid.

793
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:31,785
Is it my fault she came
here? Is it?

794
01:20:31,853 --> 01:20:34,788
-You invited her.
-Hardly.

795
01:20:34,856 --> 01:20:37,791
-She just shows up with a suitcase.
-Momma, be quiet and leave me alone.

796
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:39,793
Well, it's the truth.

797
01:20:39,861 --> 01:20:42,796
And here we are like
sardines in a can.

798
01:20:42,864 --> 01:20:45,799
-That's it... I'm sleeping out there!
-Don't you dare!

799
01:20:45,867 --> 01:20:49,803
<i>-Then stop it!
-You think I'd let you sleep with her?</i>

800
01:20:49,871 --> 01:20:52,806
<i>I won't sleep with her. I'll sleep
in the kitchen and that's that.</i>

801
01:20:52,874 --> 01:20:56,810
One more second and I'll
toss you out of this bed!

802
01:20:56,878 --> 01:20:58,812
Gladly! Do it!

803
01:20:59,881 --> 01:21:04,818
-Out you go. Hurry up!
-No way. Who gives orders around here?

804
01:21:04,886 --> 01:21:08,822
-You're sleeping here.
-Okay. Don't get upset.

805
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:11,825
That would be great! What
would the neighbors say?

806
01:21:11,893 --> 01:21:13,827
I have no covers.

807
01:21:15,864 --> 01:21:18,765
You're driving me crazy!

808
01:21:19,834 --> 01:21:22,769
You'll be the end of me.
Wretched boy.

809
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,776
You're terrible. You'll
be the death of me.

810
01:21:29,844 --> 01:21:33,780
-For God's sake. Will you go to sleep?
-Who'll take care of you then?

811
01:21:33,848 --> 01:21:37,784
Mom, go to sleep. I'll do the
dishes for you tomorrow.

812
01:21:37,852 --> 01:21:39,786
I can't wait.

813
01:21:49,864 --> 01:21:51,798
Are you okay now?

814
01:21:51,866 --> 01:21:55,802
I was almost asleep and
you start up again!

815
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,804
Please go to sleep!

816
01:21:58,873 --> 01:22:01,808
You think I feel good about this?

817
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:06,813
He scolds me for being rude to
you and he's rude himself.

818
01:22:06,881 --> 01:22:08,815
Watch out or you'll
get smacked.

819
01:22:08,883 --> 01:22:11,818
He takes after you
you're all alike.

820
01:22:11,886 --> 01:22:14,821
Jesus, you're driving me nuts!

821
01:22:15,857 --> 01:22:17,757
Will you sleep now, please?

822
01:22:18,827 --> 01:22:23,764
You'd like that. Wouldn't you? I'm
all worn-out from the two of you.

823
01:22:23,832 --> 01:22:29,771
Instead of a good night's
sleep. We argue all right.

824
01:22:29,838 --> 01:22:33,774
Please be quiet. She'll wake
up and we'll be in trouble.

825
01:22:33,842 --> 01:22:37,778
I don't give a damn about her.
She ruined my evening.

826
01:23:14,883 --> 01:23:17,750
Good for you that his
parents are so nice.

827
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:23,757
His father is nice.
Really nice.

828
01:23:25,827 --> 01:23:28,762
When will you be
going back again?

829
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:34,768
I'll be going back from
now on...

830
01:24:40,835 --> 01:24:43,770
THE END
