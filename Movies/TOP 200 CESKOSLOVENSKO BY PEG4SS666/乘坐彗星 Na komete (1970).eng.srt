1
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:13,551
Long time ago, as a young officer, I witnessed
unusual events and many heroic acts.

2
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,756
They're seemed as they never happened today.

3
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:18,792
As it wasn't even true.

4
00:00:19,363 --> 00:00:23,295
Only memories left, and few old photographs.

5
00:00:27,202 --> 00:00:30,568
That happened also to one big catastrophe in cosmos.

6
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,805
Whole world was terrified.

7
00:00:33,522 --> 00:00:42,488
Such a big event and only pile of pale postcards
and few disappointed illusions left...

8
00:00:56,123 --> 00:01:02,111
On the Comet

9
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,305
It was a beautiful age.

10
00:03:25,592 --> 00:03:26,870
The age of our youth.

11
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:31,790
Europe indulged itself in - except of
another worries - colonies.

12
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:35,320
Thanks to that we came
to this little known country.

13
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:38,405
We rode through all of it
with a gun in the hand.

14
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:41,543
We felt very well here.

15
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:46,378
We helped as much as we could
and spread civilization.

16
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:56,064
We were young, elegant, brave

17
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:58,892
and this always pays off.

18
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:13,729
Everyone here liked us.

19
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,846
And our popularity rose day by day.

20
00:04:17,698 --> 00:04:20,447
It was a golden age.

21
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:03,516
Iron-plate dishes is a treasure of house.

22
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,098
Even you can't break it.

23
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:06,553
I'll be right there.

24
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,824
Please, choose as you wish.

25
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:11,674
Look.

26
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:16,181
Exact fifteen, madam.

27
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:20,058
I hope you'll visit my shop soon again.

28
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:24,347
Throw away the loam sherds and
buy proper iron-plate dishes.

29
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,858
Sir lieutenant has chosen, hasn't he?

30
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,984
He has chosen well.

31
00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:33,455
One can't meet such girl here sadly.

32
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,792
Nice, isn't she?

33
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:38,031
Really nice.

34
00:06:02,554 --> 00:06:05,737
Hold the stick tightly!
Come to life!

35
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:27,133
He has probably gone mad.
The african sun makes that.

36
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:30,108
Wat did I tell you,
straighten up the stick.

37
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:32,734
And stop with that.

38
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:38,081
What if it burns?

39
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:55,566
I would be also better with
beautiful girl on my side.

40
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:59,095
I would like such one.

41
00:06:59,747 --> 00:07:01,931
Maybe she would like me too.

42
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:04,433
She would surely admired me.

43
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:07,603
Seizing colonies is not enough, miss.

44
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,261
They have to be mapped, measured...

45
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:13,363
Why do you think battles are led?

46
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:15,369
For land.

47
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,436
When I move one single line

48
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:21,176
I'll do for homeland more than
whole riding company.

49
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:24,319
Due to me, miss.
Oh.

50
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:33,459
Your appreciation is
a great honour to me.

51
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:36,247
Let me introduce,
lieutenant Servadac.

52
00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:45,524
Sir lieutenant,
come to life!

53
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:48,834
Watch yourself!

54
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:53,890
Don't be affraid, miss.

55
00:07:54,394 --> 00:07:57,365
I can't do my country out of
one single meter of colonial area.

56
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,804
Attention, sir!

57
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:03,836
Sir lieutenant!

58
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:49,416
So, this is the end.

59
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:52,558
Without fame, without medal.

60
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:57,346
It was irresponsible that they didn't
teach us to swim in the military school.

61
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:06,314
Good bye, miss,
I'm dying for my country.

62
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:37,266
Can I ask you where
did you swim from?

63
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:39,129
Me?

64
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:42,080
From Valencia.

65
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:43,772
The whole way to africa?

66
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:45,985
We are in Africa?

67
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,720
You really don't know you're in Africa?

68
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,392
I was kidnapped and closed on ship.

69
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:53,401
I didn't know where are we sailing.

70
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:55,472
And what did they want to do with me.

71
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,206
Although they still guarded me,
I had decided I would run away.

72
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:01,655
The ship harboured this morning and
I heard the voice of my kidnapper.

73
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,767
He is also from Valencia.

74
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:06,032
But he is a bad man.

75
00:10:06,262 --> 00:10:08,116
He shot at my brothers,
when they defended me.

76
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:09,851
I take the whole cargo.

77
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:11,588
Deal, efendi.

78
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:14,643
Tell me a king.
I will be it tomorrow.

79
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:16,176
You will be, king.

80
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:18,431
My stuff will secure it for you.

81
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,281
You'll be satisfied,
it's a good stuff.

82
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:47,557
It's heavy like thunder.

83
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:20,751
What are you doing, man?

84
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:31,955
Where do you have a crate, rascals?

85
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:35,369
Pack it up, hurry.

86
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:38,204
Don't piss me, rascals.

87
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,139
Or you will know, what
really your captain is.

88
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:48,708
You'll be laughing at me?

89
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,997
Move guys,
this is not a trip.

90
00:11:57,752 --> 00:12:00,669
Move, you're in the way.

91
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:38,747
How much do you want for the guns?
How much will you give?

92
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:40,921
About 300.
400, king.

93
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:43,827
I guarantee for the guns.
They will make you a ruler of this land.

94
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:48,423
I will make a ruler myself.
It's none of your bussiness.

95
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:13,994
You'll give me some more.

96
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:17,216
Come, I'll show you something.

97
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:28,337
The bitch! She has run away.

98
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,676
I don't care.
Patience, king.

99
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:39,977
You'll see in the moment.
I'll only arrange something.

100
00:13:40,263 --> 00:13:41,680
Please, come with me.

101
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:44,521
Boat on water, quickly guys.

102
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:10,746
And when I founded you,
the second sun on sky rose.

103
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,371
I've thought I'm imagining
when I saw it.

104
00:14:15,592 --> 00:14:17,826
But I doubt the second one is sun.

105
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,366
It hasn't got its own light,
it is probably some unknown planet.

106
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,699
Rushes to us with huge velocity.

107
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,532
Let's come away before
something happens to us.

108
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:32,753
This is more precious for you
than thousand more rifles.

109
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,048
I'm coming as a consul.

110
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:37,345
Ethiquette demands a gift.

111
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:42,084
Next to them there must be
an honor party and this is all they have.

112
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:43,690
Look.

113
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:46,524
Simple but reliable.

114
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:48,287
It only can't be reversed.

115
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:50,943
When candle burns out to here...

116
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:54,297
...it fires on linstock...
Do you understand?

117
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:56,322
Everyone will be wiped away.

118
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:59,651
And you as soon as you hear a blowup,
attack the city with your riders.

119
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:04,161
Look at the sky, king.

120
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:06,383
Evil star.

121
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:08,491
Sky is ready for something.
Back to paddles.

122
00:15:09,265 --> 00:15:11,008
Careful, rascals!

123
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,786
Don't mind the sky and pull on.

124
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,489
Wouldn't we wait for better weather?

125
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,884
I have to be a king since the sunrise.

126
00:15:23,218 --> 00:15:25,067
I sweared so.

127
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:29,817
Let your steps be happy, king.

128
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,413
Do you think that uprise
will be succesfull, excellency?

129
00:15:32,746 --> 00:15:34,720
Our weapons will help them.

130
00:15:35,073 --> 00:15:38,131
The fort will be taken by them
and after that we'll come.

131
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:40,702
We won't get angry anyone
and push through our interests.

132
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:42,645
And all you see, captain

133
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:46,069
the whole this beautiful country
will fall to the spanish crown

134
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:48,397
under rule of his majesty.

135
00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:51,104
This is my holy mission.

136
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,874
A ship, sir.

137
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,478
It's a spanish ship, sir.

138
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,410
His excellency is arriving, sir.

139
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,451
Consul.

140
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,683
Shall we fire for greeting?

141
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:38,122
Sir, I report, lieutenant Servadac
fell from the rock during filling his duties.

142
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,193
That's all sir, after that
he was falling with head down.

143
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,698
We have to admit the worst then.

144
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,869
And did you risk
your life for your officer?

145
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,536
I didn't, sir.

146
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,907
Go back, immediately.

147
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:58,146
Give him some soldiers
to retrieve his mistake.

148
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,384
Shall we fire for greetings, sir?

149
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,154
Yes, but only once, we will need bullets
for much more important things.

150
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,524
It seems they fired.

151
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,802
We are waiting for the command, sir.

152
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,874
Fire from all cannons
so they can see we are a superpower.

153
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,577
Are you alright?

154
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,017
Have we collide yet?

155
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,679
No, it was a grenade.

156
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,650
Our grenade, the sixteen.

157
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,571
Don't be affraid.
That was not ours.

158
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,784
Look what compass is doing, sir.

159
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:07,750
Magnetic errors?

160
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,284
There has been no one here before.

161
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:36,410
They probably suspects
coming catastrophe.

162
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,346
What will happen to us?

163
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,012
We will surely die.

164
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:01,535
Prepare yourselves.

165
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,972
Our time is near.

166
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:42,773
What does that mean?

167
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,339
A storm, sir.

168
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,176
That's your resposibility, captain.

169
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,683
Yes, sir.

170
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,310
We won't find lieutenant here.

171
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,177
Do you want to look
for him in such weather?

172
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,811
We'll better wait here.

173
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,664
The judgement day is here.

174
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,032
Where will you put it?

175
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,204
In front of the squad.

176
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,234
Near to you?

177
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,164
As much far from me as it goes.

178
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,413
Weather is terrible, isn't it?

179
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,385
I don't mind the weather.

180
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:36,591
Colonel, this is a souvenir
from my country.

181
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,971
Down!

182
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,036
Let's go!

183
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,716
Oh my god.
Our Earth.

184
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,960
It's unbelievable,
but it's Earth.

185
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,224
Aren't we on Earth anymore?

186
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:32,469
Planet has taken us
with itself without a collision.

187
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,997
On the planet.
We're going far from Earth.

188
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,443
That's good.
At least the evil people won't find me.

189
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:07,669
Look, sir, it really is Earth,
I see Europe and Africa.

190
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,471
Yes Lacoste, I see it too.

191
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,541
But what about us, where are we?

192
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,881
What are we standing on?

193
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,649
How could we tear away from Earth?

194
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,487
I'm curious what will
write Le monde about it next week.

195
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,722
Don't you have a knife
to cut off a cigar?

196
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,337
Let's go gentlemen.

197
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,534
Oh my god, lieutenant.

198
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:47,435
Sir.

199
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,380
Ben! Why didn't jump for me?

200
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:55,442
I've got a command to retrieve my mistake.
Now I'll jump into the water witout hesitating.

201
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,254
I think they have no idea
what has happened.

202
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,523
Good we're not alone in the world.

203
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,824
We'll have more fun.

204
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:16,497
The planet is ours!
We can do whatever we want.

205
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:40,188
Gentlemen, we've got into this situation without warning

206
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:44,127
with low number of men,
with insufficient supply of grain.

207
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,930
Partially rotten, sir.

208
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,562
Lieutenant, you'll speak
when you'll be asked to!

209
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,868
What are you doing?

210
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,434
There'll be a discipline even
if barrows fell from sky.

211
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,290
Your safeguard is on.

212
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,003
A fly.

213
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,608
Flesh-fly.

214
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,306
Gentlemen, that's unbelievable.

215
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,008
What a piece!

216
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,850
What do you say on this, gentlemen?

217
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,420
I have unpleasant feeling
the aborigines are to blame.

218
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,122
I would blame spanish.

219
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:16,852
Safeguard on before putting back,
don't forget that please.

220
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,267
What are you affraid of?

221
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:37,405
He can't hurt you here.
You're under an army protection.

222
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,635
According to the army law
women can't go into the fortress, sir.

223
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,836
Fool. I'll explain everything
to my commander.

224
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,070
I'll wait.

225
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,611
Good then, I'll be back immediately.

226
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,300
Cursed storm.

227
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,901
Be glad we're alive.

228
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:48,538
What shall we do with the rascal?

229
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,409
We have to find him first.

230
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,012
I won't go home without Angelica.

231
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:36,152
You've destroyed a common man!

232
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:41,098
Don't be affraid, you'll stay with us.
You'll like it.

233
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:45,029
You can't walk like this,
you need something to wear.

234
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,630
What about this.

235
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,506
It'll suit you.

236
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,682
Is he gone?

237
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,246
Peace with you, king.

238
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,247
Where were you for so long?

239
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,284
We were looking for you, king.

240
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,819
I should have punish you.

241
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,515
We've saved our own lives.

242
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:39,984
Follow me.

243
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:47,887
I've got horses for you.

244
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:55,605
We'll take arms from the enemy.

245
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:56,868
Up!

246
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,378
What a situation, gentlemen.

247
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,949
Our ministry wasn't able
to notice us in time.

248
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,419
They didn't find out this.

249
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:21,094
Fortunately France hasn't left us,
gentlemen.

250
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,537
During revolution.

251
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,836
In case of war.

252
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:09,310
Army during coronation.

253
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,907
A little bit old instructions.

254
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,080
Confusing situation.

255
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,254
This is it, gentlemen.

256
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,532
I've got an order to arrest all foreigners.

257
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,273
I'm a diplomat.

258
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,175
And I'm not a foreigner.

259
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,638
I've got an immunity.

260
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:44,442
Don't touch me.
You're speaking a lot.

261
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,851
Don't touch me.
Don't be impertiment.

262
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,262
Where is our sister?

263
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,463
Speak rascal.

264
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:49,540
She has run away, boys.

265
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:50,596
You're lying, rascal.

266
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:54,707
Where's a captain?

267
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,212
He's got visitors.

268
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,543
You're coming just in time, lieutenant.

269
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:08,518
Captain, I've got a command to arrest you.
All foreigners has to be arrested.

270
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:11,995
Go on, lieutenant.
Do your duty.

271
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:16,792
Where do you come from,
boys?

272
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,195
From Valencia.

273
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,166
Arrest them all.

274
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,180
Angelica, hide.

275
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,351
They're arresting foreigners.

276
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,461
What about you?

277
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,257
I'll be alright, go.

278
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:21,029
Who'll pay me lost time, please?

279
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,597
How many bullets do you give to guards?

280
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:29,671
Two a man.

281
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,809
Give three.
So we can't be surprised by anything.

282
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,903
Where do you say the cattle come from?

283
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,164
The planet has probably prehistoric fauna.

284
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,607
Are you sure they're herbivorous?

285
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:12,677
Prepare to fire.

286
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,595
On my command - fire!

287
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,580
They hasn't stopped for a second.

288
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,080
I will send a ride.

289
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,056
You'll lead the attack, lieutenant.

290
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:01,957
Congratulations!

291
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:03,734
At your order, colonel.

292
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:23,850
Longitude 300. Angle 12.

293
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,447
Wait, captain.
You're shooting at our own soldiers.

294
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:24,008
I've always said
that our ride isn't made for fight.

295
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,910
Give it back! Immediately!

296
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:37,225
Wares is confiscated,
it's an order of the commander.

297
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:38,784
Thieves.

298
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,102
Run away ladies as soon as it goes.

299
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,951
You're in danger here.
Let's go to safer place.

300
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:46,628
Come down.

301
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,537
I don't understand this.

302
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:12,207
We fired on them,
we sent a ride on them,
and suddenly this.

303
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,042
Gentlemen, let's get up.

304
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,995
Angelica! Angelica!

305
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,533
Are you alright?

306
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:43,205
Yes. My hero.

307
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:48,179
Congratulations, lieutenant.
I'll recommedn you for Iron cross.

308
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,753
How did you do it?

309
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,017
They were drive back by the noise.

310
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,291
What about our cannons?

311
00:44:56,427 --> 00:45:01,160
They're useless.
It reminds them storm and they know it.

312
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:04,630
But clank of pots,
that's the iron age.

313
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:09,829
Gentlemen, we've found
a new weapon, a new strategy.

314
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:14,308
And what in such a case
says our instructions?

315
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:17,837
Old weapons replace
by new technology.

316
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:20,506
It means that your
cannons can be thrown out.

317
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:28,055
What are you staring at, gentlemen?
That's an order.

318
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,333
Isn't it a nonsense
what are we doing?

319
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,265
Which command is not?

320
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,730
Throw away guns!

321
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,903
Stand still!

322
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,462
We're waiting for your orders, king.

323
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,904
Peace with you, king.

324
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,606
You owe me something.

325
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,401
I'll send you guns immediately.

326
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:36,502
I don't need them
from you anymore.

327
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:44,112
Guns, cannons,
we've taken everything.

328
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:05,798
We're ready to attack, king.

329
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,274
Fight, my faithful.

330
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,284
It's bad, commander.

331
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:19,080
I know it, heck, I haven't lost
first battle in my life.

332
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,279
Don't forget on ladies, lieutenant.

333
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,287
Don't worry about me,
I'll die with you.

334
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,020
That wouldn't be the worst.

335
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:58,890
Here you have, madam.

336
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:02,830
There is only one bullet,
I've been hiding it for myself.

337
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,647
Evil star.

338
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,082
Cursed kismet.

339
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:04,722
What do you think, gentlemen?

340
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,393
Lieutenant is an astronomer.

341
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:08,928
Surveyor, captain.

342
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:11,658
Can you explain it, lieutenant?

343
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:16,128
It is probably planet Mars,
we're in a area of its gravity.

344
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,308
Do you think
we could collide?

345
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,301
I'm affraid of worst.

346
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,441
Why we have still
to be affraid of collision?

347
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,007
Planet we are on is small,

348
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:32,087
on the way through universe
is attracted to bigger ones.

349
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,079
Collision is inevitable.

350
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:39,218
Gentlemen, dismissed.

351
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:53,407
What happens?

352
00:51:56,246 --> 00:52:00,615
Let it go, gentlemen.
The end of world is near.

353
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:06,719
Will you yield to a destiny, king?

354
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:11,456
If it is the end of world,
the fight is worthless.

355
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,528
Tell my faithfull to go home.

356
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,578
Where were you?

357
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,720
Your majesty, king, you're my guest.
I've invited you.

358
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,560
No, you're a guest of king.

359
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:29,094
Here I give you all you gave to me,
now you don't need my guns anyway.

360
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,974
At home on earth I would have never said it.

361
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,274
You'll have a monument
once at home.

362
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:37,506
Is it what my enemy says?

363
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:40,174
You will have one,
give me a hug!

364
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,749
My loved women,
why are you running away?

365
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:53,728
I've bought you properly,
I feed you properly, is my behavior bad?

366
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,320
Everyone only with those whom loves.

367
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,696
Everyone will do whatever he wants.

368
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,277
It seems there's a civilization.

369
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:13,544
Built by hands of reasonable beings.
Our grave will be in a perfect world.

370
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,874
What's for us if we're dead.

371
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:20,049
We've got no influence
on turns of nature.

372
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,642
Get out! Quickly!

373
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:44,813
You're not supposed to be here. Away!

374
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,619
Noone will abuse
turns of nature.

375
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:57,959
Or shouldn't I?

376
00:54:58,061 --> 00:54:59,028
Angelica, I've wanted long ago...

377
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,324
Don't speak.
We're short of time.

378
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:17,611
Oh my god. Mars is more far.
We won't collide.

379
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:21,717
I was wrong.
There won't be the end of world.

380
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:28,751
We're saved.

381
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:33,889
We will live!

382
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:54,413
We're saved!
We won't collide! There won't be the end of wordl!

383
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,882
The planet missed us!
Ester, we will live!

384
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,954
Wait, madam.
If there's no end, you have to pay.

385
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:05,224
There won't be the end of world!

386
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,756
Look, the star is more far.

387
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:17,272
I'll go tell scheick.

388
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,035
I'll go better myself.

389
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:03,808
What have you done?

390
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,611
You rascal!

391
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:39,454
Let me be!

392
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,914
Do you hear me?

393
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,661
Who asked you?
Why are you interfering?

394
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:50,027
Thank to God we didn't
let you there.

395
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,964
Let go.

396
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,368
There won't be the end of world.

397
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:57,767
We're saved!

398
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:31,264
Don't look there.

399
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,267
Enough of obscenities.

400
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,782
Captain, follow me.

401
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:42,642
To the fortress.

402
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:47,322
Soldiers went home, king.
You let them to.

403
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:50,883
Pay up please.

404
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:54,689
Fortress fell, lieutenant?

405
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:58,698
Commander, my bride
was kidnapped. On the sea.

406
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,105
Captain, you're the only one,
who can help me. We have to catch them.

407
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,902
The ship is not allowed to leave a port.

408
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,170
Lieutenant, situation demands
to return to the fortress.

409
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:10,106
I've thought we let it go.

410
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,577
You've gone mad.

411
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,739
Why we can't live in peace,
we could till now.

412
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,082
We've thought that
the end of world is here.

413
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,948
Why can't we live as such on?

414
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,253
You're a phantast.

415
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:21,423
Commander

416
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:28,186
There's no single bullet in the fortress,
we've lost in advance.

417
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,869
Lieutenant, let's go.

418
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:42,878
Gentlemen, lieutenant has a proposition.
It's worth to think about.

419
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:48,240
Gentlemen, I think,
we're castaways of space.

420
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,280
Let's try to live in peace together.

421
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,222
It's an utopia.

422
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:55,314
It was probably an utopia on Earth.

423
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,721
But now, since we've got our own planet,
nothing can stop us to live as such on.

424
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:02,120
Let's try gentlemen,
it's worth of it.

425
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,028
I affirm it's an utopia.

426
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,295
What will be our flag?
Ours, of course.

427
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,295
No, colonel,
I don't approve your colors.

428
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:14,571
Gentlemen, I propose all colors.
Colors of us all.

429
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:25,146
We're sailing according to a sun seemingly to the north.
Somewhere here will kidnappers search Valencia.

430
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:27,019
And here we'll catch them.

431
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:31,389
Cheers to happy encounter with beautiful bride
and nice brothers-in-law.

432
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:36,558
Land on starboard!

433
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,601
What does land do here?

434
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:43,267
Coast and it waves.

435
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,564
After one glass?
No way.

436
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:55,316
It really waves.

437
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,549
Set alert, captain.

438
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,218
Alarm.

439
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:46,893
An island in front of us.

440
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:48,656
A real island?

441
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:51,796
A real one this time, look.

442
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:56,929
The beasts again.

443
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:34,403
Watch shallow water.

444
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:38,278
We interrupt a peace of Carbon forest.

445
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:43,714
Future Lotrin basin.
We've come two million years earlier.

446
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,459
We witness a species transformation.

447
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,529
Life came out of the sea,
here is an example.

448
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:18,451
Boar rump on cream with cranberries,
or roasted on butter with basted wine?

449
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:20,152
No, don't shoot.

450
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:21,655
It'll be delicate, gentlemen.

451
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:23,783
We're not justified
to interrupt evolution of nature.

452
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,158
We'll better wait
to its offsprings

453
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,696
You don't look
forward to home?

454
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:51,579
Good day, gentlemen.

455
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:54,848
Don't worry,
only the beasts again.

456
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:57,853
No clue of kidnappers,
unfortunately.

457
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:58,756
We have to find them.

458
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:05,256
What the hell was that?

459
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,164
Potsherds mean fortune.

460
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,341
For god's sake,
we've forgot Brittish.

461
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:15,442
They're everywhere.
Even in Primaries.

462
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,381
We've got
the kidnappers, Ben, look.

463
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,714
I recognize their boat.

464
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,449
Captain, raise up the flag,
and prepare a boat.

465
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,488
Boat on water.

466
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:43,903
What leads you to Gibraltar, sir?

467
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,737
Gibraltar? This?

468
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:53,743
I can swear.
Who are you?

469
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:55,616
I'm a citizen of universe.

470
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:59,580
Britain doesn't
approve an anarchy, sir.

471
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:03,487
Shooting at ships on the sea
is a brittish habit?

472
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:07,491
The brittish habit is to celebrate
birthday of hers majesty.

473
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:09,692
That is today, sir.

474
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:12,231
Soda?

475
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,666
May I please french cognac?

476
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:16,000
On the birthday of her majesty?

477
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:17,906
More soda then.

478
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,451
Welcome on board, madam.

479
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:40,254
Should I prepare eggs with ham
or something else?

480
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,796
Where is mr. Servadac?

481
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:46,865
Our duty is to guard Gibraltar,
not to contemplate about it.

482
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:51,236
We're a part of another planet, major.
How could we fly through universe elsewhere?

483
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:57,040
In that case I declare this planet
as a colony of her majesty.

484
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:06,512
I'm looking for a girl.
She was on a boat harbouring in your port.

485
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:07,556
On a boat?

486
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:13,652
There was only few anarchists on the boat?
They stepped with no warranty on a land of her majesty.

487
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:16,220
That's why they're
in a prison of her majesty.

488
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:17,492
But there was
a lady on the boat.

489
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:23,868
On such boat and
in such company couldn't be a lady.

490
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,409
A lady which worth
a notice of a gentleman.

491
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:45,586
Cheers to newly-weds.
Cheers to health of our new home.

492
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:52,291
Mr. Servadac found a woman of his heart.
And for us all a path to a peaceful life.

493
01:07:55,504 --> 01:08:00,134
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me in this twice celebration moment

494
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:06,609
rise up a cup to health of newly-weds
and to a happy return of a crew.

495
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:12,788
Earth.

496
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:22,155
I see France.

497
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:27,727
Spain.

498
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:16,079
Gentlemen,
we're going home.

499
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:55,312
Do you look forward?

500
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:57,253
I'm affraid a little bit.

501
01:09:57,393 --> 01:09:58,189
Affraid of what?

502
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:02,157
Of our old world.
We've escaped only for a moment, see?

503
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:23,116
I'm a little bit affraid of our old world

504
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:25,813
we've escaped only for a moment, see?

505
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:12,161
Roll-call!

506
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:14,933
Roll-call!

507
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:49,031
We're going home.
It changes the situation, colonel

508
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:53,004
We've got our
directors, duties, commands.

509
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:59,947
My last command from ministry
is to prepare a dignified greeting for you.

510
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:04,174
I'm very sorry that
events have stopped it.

511
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:08,479
Your soldiers have lost an occasion
to show in full arms.

512
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:11,559
But nothing limits us now
to try once again.

513
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:12,525
Great.

514
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:30,977
Where is his excellency?

515
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:38,609
Everyone away.

516
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:44,883
Fight!

517
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:43,377
On the fortress.

518
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:06,330
And now we'll lecture the other side,
so they can see who's in charge here.

519
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,369
Prepare cannons.

520
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:48,581
They're shooting at us, king.

521
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:20,077
Ben, wait.

522
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:23,516
You know you
can't leave me.

523
01:15:23,585 --> 01:15:25,576
I know.
The command of colonel.

524
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:30,319
Angelica.

525
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,300
Sir!

526
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,891
Where is Angelica?

527
01:17:03,549 --> 01:17:07,175
