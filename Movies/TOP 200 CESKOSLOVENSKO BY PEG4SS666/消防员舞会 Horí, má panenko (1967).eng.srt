3
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:41,097
Show me.

4
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,898
That's nice, isn't it?

5
00:00:52,263 --> 00:00:54,439
It's very nice.
He'll like it.

6
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:55,896
Show me.

7
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,448
That's nice.

8
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:11,292
Give it to me.

9
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,265
I'm sure he'll like it.

10
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,053
Nice, very nice,
but I tell you

11
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,893
we should've given it
to him sooner, like last year,

12
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,476
when he celebrated his
eighty-fifth birthday.

13
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:34,931
Not now at the last moment.

14
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:39,692
Well, that's true,
but last year

15
00:01:40,296 --> 00:01:43,829
we didn't know he'd get
cancer this year.

16
00:01:44,534 --> 00:01:47,670
That's just it, now it looks
as if we want to give it to him

17
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,083
quickly before he dies. And
you expect him to be pleased.

18
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:56,615
We're the only ones who know
he's got cancer. He doesn't.

19
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:59,122
So he can still
be pleased, can't he?

20
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:03,961
How do you know he doesn't know,
you asked him?

21
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:05,944
Well and who should
have told him?

22
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:09,647
We won't tell and
the doctor won't either.

23
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:12,036
The doctor won't tell him.

24
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:13,697
The law says the
doctor can't tell him.

25
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:16,704
You could have
the worst cancer

26
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,127
and the doctor won't tell you.

27
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:20,577
That's why nobody believes
doctors.

28
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:24,291
Don't tell me.
Nobody has to tell me.

29
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:28,417
Everyone feels it when
their last hour has come.

30
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:30,905
Nobody has to tell him.

31
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:33,085
You haven't died yet
so you can't know.

32
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:36,103
Wait a minute, guys, we won't
get anywhere like this.

33
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:44,838
If he knows then he knows, and
if he doesn't we won't tell him.

34
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:47,783
Franta, you are such
a hypochondriac...

35
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:50,996
Don't you dare ask him where
his cancer hurts or something...

36
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:56,265
Don't worry, I won't.

37
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:56,110
What a dumb joke. Vaclav!

38
00:03:59,103 --> 00:04:01,381
Stop screwing around, man.

39
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,369
Well, there is no time
for that now. How stupid.

40
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,464
There was a cake here.

41
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,557
What?

42
00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:18,460
Give it here. It's not for me,
it's for the people!

43
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,984
What do you want me to do?

44
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,588
Mr. Balcar!

45
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,137
Wait, don't talk to him now.

46
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,918
Mr. Balcar!

47
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,929
What? Don't talk to me now!

48
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:48,223
I told you. I was standing here
holding the ladder.

49
00:04:48,427 --> 00:04:50,841
I couldn't see what was
going on behind my back.

50
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:54,575
How can I know whether
anybody was there or not?

51
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:56,768
Well? Don't you agree?

52
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,272
Wait, what should we do now?

53
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:01,992
Well, I don't know.

54
00:05:02,197 --> 00:05:03,550
Just a minute.

55
00:05:04,382 --> 00:05:06,425
Well, I don't know either.
It's just the two of us here.

56
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:10,629
Only us two, but I really
don't know anything about it.

57
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:12,648
Somebody must have taken it.

58
00:05:13,818 --> 00:05:16,661
Then search me, gentlemen.

59
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:20,702
Sit down, Lojzik.
It couldn't have been you.

60
00:05:23,385 --> 00:05:28,046
Look here, I saw it!
-You see too much.

61
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:29,797
-Look here, don't lie to me.
-You see too much.

62
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:31,922
Vaclav, don't lie.
That foot wasn't there!

63
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:32,677
Of course it was.

64
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:34,669
Look, the ladder is standing
by itself.

65
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:36,359
Stop it. It could fall down!

66
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:38,671
It won't. Just look,
it won't fall down.

67
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:42,543
Look here, I don't believe that
you were here the whole time.

68
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,853
You were not here, because
your foot was here like that!

69
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:48,702
You had it like that. I saw it.

70
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,555
-What are you saying?
-I saw it.

71
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,339
Why do you keep pushing me?

72
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,028
Damn it, I saw it! Here! Here!

73
00:05:54,238 --> 00:05:57,244
Saw it, saw it...You should have
watched the cake and not me!

74
00:05:57,827 --> 00:05:58,903
Who could have taken it?

75
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:00,126
I didn't!

76
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,504
Somebody who could have left!

77
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:02,758
I didn't take it.
You better watch it!

78
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:06,549
I won't work with you any longer
because you're all liars!

79
00:06:06,762 --> 00:06:07,160
But...

80
00:06:07,364 --> 00:06:09,129
You could have gone away
from here...

81
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,895
I'm not staying here with you.

82
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:11,835
What did you say?

83
00:06:12,043 --> 00:06:14,344
I'm leaving.
I won't stay here. I'm going!

84
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:17,349
Well, well, Josef... What...
What are you doing?

85
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:19,691
For God's sake,
where are you going?

86
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:28,077
Help! Help! Let me...
Let me down! Let me down!

87
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:37,098
Let me down!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

88
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,915
I...I can't...hold on any longer.
I can't... Let me down! Help!

89
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:52,070
Let me down, plea...
I...I'm letting go!

90
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:53,871
Allow me, gentlemen.

91
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:59,584
I am letting go. I'm...I'm
letting go...I'm letting go.

92
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:25,351
THE FIREMEN'S BALL

93
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:37,019
Go, go, go, go, go, you fool.

94
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:41,169
Guys, we have to look at this
sensibly, don't you think?

95
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:42,872
There is no point in...

96
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:43,508
What?

97
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:47,015
Take a good look at them
and you'll see.

98
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,244
Guys, like this...

99
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:51,485
Vasek, he's got a lot of
common sense.

100
00:09:51,797 --> 00:09:54,929
Damn it, guys, stop fighting.
It's starting to piss me off.

101
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:58,746
Wait a minute, I'll count them.
Wait, I'll count them.

102
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:01,917
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven...

103
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,929
Just a minute, gentlemen.
We're going to elect a beauty queen

104
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:10,804
from around here. You've got girls
from around the world, too many...

105
00:10:11,982 --> 00:10:14,510
Wait a minute.
We won't take them all.

106
00:10:14,722 --> 00:10:19,028
We'll take...well,
how many?

107
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:41,788
Mother, I had a bottle
of cognac here.

108
00:10:41,993 --> 00:10:42,721
Where?

109
00:10:42,927 --> 00:10:43,724
Here.

110
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,091
And it isn't there?

111
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:47,471
Look for yourself.
You can see that it's gone.

112
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:48,698
That's impossible.

113
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,118
It was right here, see?

114
00:10:53,322 --> 00:10:54,550
Did you really put it there?

115
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:55,952
Of course I did!

116
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:00,933
I've been here the whole time.
It's not my fault.

117
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,572
There was nobody here.

118
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:04,842
You didn't watch it.

119
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:05,914
I did.

120
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:07,989
You did not!

121
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:10,060
I'm telling you that I did watch!

122
00:11:10,698 --> 00:11:12,428
What were you watching?

123
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,870
I don't know what you watched there,
but you weren't watching here!

124
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,573
Don't shout at me!

125
00:11:17,715 --> 00:11:20,688
I...I am not shouting!
You call this shouting?

126
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:23,921
I am telling you quite calmly,
aren't I?

127
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:27,767
You did not watch.
The bottle is gone!

128
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:30,043
I should think...
How silly.

129
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:33,215
Wait a minute. We have to make
our minds up whether

130
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:35,415
we are going to take two or ten
or twelve or six.

131
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,684
Eight.

132
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:39,367
-Eight?
-Eight.

133
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:44,706
Yes, but they must be the most
beautiful we have. Remember.

134
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:47,285
I understand. I understand.

135
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,657
Do it then.

136
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,998
The most beautiful girls
we have here.

137
00:12:46,273 --> 00:12:49,040
We can't see anything from here, guys.

138
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:52,153
We'll have to go to the balcony
to see real busts.

139
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:59,002
Vaclav, look, I only called you
because I had

140
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:04,048
a bottle of cognac here.
Mother and I were watching it carefully

141
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:09,186
and now the bottle's gone.
Just look.

142
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:11,826
And where is it?

143
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:14,241
That's why
I am calling you,

144
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:18,475
so that people wouldn't
think it was us...that we...

145
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:22,283
you know...that we
pinched it.

146
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:32,443
But Josef...

147
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,509
Where is that headcheese?

148
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:40,928
What headcheese?

149
00:13:41,476 --> 00:13:44,089
There was a headcheese here.

150
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:51,482
Well, there was a chocolate ball
here, you know, that was here,

151
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:55,373
but no headcheese, Vaclav.
Vaclav, well, really...

152
00:13:55,582 --> 00:14:00,483
I was here. No, there was definitely
no headcheese. No!

153
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:12,742
And where is that
chocolate ball?

154
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:24,809
Don't talk. Wait a minute.
Chocolate ball...

155
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:33,574
Chocolate...Mother, come here.
There was a chocolate ball here.

156
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:34,910
What ball?

157
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:36,405
A chocolate ball!

158
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:39,904
There was no chocolate ball.

159
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:42,468
I tell you...there was...

160
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,497
You are making it up, man!

161
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:50,154
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Perhaps there was

162
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,856
a headcheese.
Vaclav, you know you're right.

163
00:14:58,161 --> 00:14:59,250
It was a headcheese.

164
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,391
Well, that's all right, then.
Excellent.

165
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:02,387
Everything is all right.

166
00:15:02,592 --> 00:15:05,521
But, damn it,
where is the headcheese?

167
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:18,278
That's a woman.
I'd call her a queen.

168
00:15:23,277 --> 00:15:25,707
Legs. I want to see legs!

169
00:15:36,404 --> 00:15:39,833
Guys, we're doing it all wrong.

170
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,252
We are looking at their legs and
should be looking at their faces.

171
00:15:44,863 --> 00:15:47,190
The face must be like a picture.

172
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,614
Face like a picture -
they're the worst.

173
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:03,340
Come and have a look, men.
I like that one,

174
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:07,238
the one scratching her head.
What do you say to that?

175
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:09,138
Well...

176
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:12,574
Otto, Otto!

177
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,935
Put that Blanka Truhlarova
on the list, too.

178
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:17,933
Who?

179
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:20,733
Don't ask any questions and
put her down! Blanka Truhlarova!

180
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:28,025
For Christ's sake, what are you
writing there?

181
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:30,362
Blanka Truhlarova.

182
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:34,126
Don't put her there.
She's a nightmare.

183
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:38,284
Wait, wait, add her to the list.

184
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:46,678
I did already.
Should I leave her there?

185
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:49,179
All right, leave her then.

186
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,314
Well, we've got the first.

187
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:15,233
Mother, they caught on.

188
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:17,259
Stop that guys.

189
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:18,827
And who ordered it?

190
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:20,064
I didn't.

191
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:22,120
I didn't either.

192
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:24,561
Well, who did then?

193
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:29,459
I did. Have a drink.
There's my girl, sitting over there.

194
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,816
He'll want us to add his
Ruzena, too.

195
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:38,212
Fine, we've got two already!

196
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:40,316
Which one is she?

197
00:17:54,014 --> 00:17:56,771
See that one there? That's her.

198
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:07,801
This is from those three men
over there

199
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,229
and you're not supposed
to send them anymore.

200
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:18,993
Good evening, miss.

201
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:20,151
Miss...

202
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:21,917
We came on behalf...

203
00:18:22,127 --> 00:18:25,989
-We're from the ball committee.
-Wait.

204
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:27,085
Tell her...

205
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,118
Miss...

206
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:29,185
We are...

207
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:31,581
If you would...

208
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:32,976
that you...

209
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:35,979
like to participate in the
beauty queen contest.

210
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:38,940
You are quite a decent and
good-Iooking girl.

211
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:40,475
What do you say?

212
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:45,533
Don't do this to me, guys!

213
00:18:46,012 --> 00:18:46,977
Wait.

214
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,333
What should I wait for when
I'm talking to you?

215
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:54,002
Get him out of here, please.
Get him out of here.

216
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:56,599
Ludvik, come on, come on.

217
00:18:57,037 --> 00:18:58,194
What is it?

218
00:19:00,737 --> 00:19:02,597
Come on, what's wrong with you?

219
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:04,922
Jesus Christ, why us?

220
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:09,858
Just you wait, you.
We chose the lady here.

221
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:14,457
Add our Ruzena to that list
so that she'll leave me in peace.

222
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:20,485
Ludva, Ludva, she looks so much
like you,

223
00:19:21,023 --> 00:19:23,212
you can't even imagine
how much.

224
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,415
Well, she's my daughter.

225
00:19:25,987 --> 00:19:27,950
I also...I also think so.

226
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:33,238
Well, don't laugh.
Miss, can we count on you?

227
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:43,500
Franta, Franta, come here.
Come here, I say!

228
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,802
Vrsecka and Matejickova...

229
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:50,601
I never knew what good looking
girls we had.

230
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:51,961
We've got three already.

231
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:53,860
Franta, don't bullshit,
just write.

232
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:54,691
What's her name?

233
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:56,261
Vrsecka and Matejickova.

234
00:19:57,165 --> 00:20:00,152
Otto!

235
00:20:02,296 --> 00:20:05,883
That Blanka I told you,
cross her out!

236
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:09,519
What for? A moment ago
you told me to put her down.

237
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:12,286
And now I'm telling you to cross
her out ... definitely.

238
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,817
What should I do then?
Cross her out?

239
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:16,506
Don't cross out anything!

240
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:18,404
But she said "cross her out"!

241
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:19,680
Damn it, what do you want?

242
00:20:19,883 --> 00:20:20,812
Well, cross her out then.

243
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:22,675
All right, I'll cross her out.

244
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:25,147
I watched.

245
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:26,490
You didn't!

246
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:27,438
I did!

247
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:30,436
It wasn't my fault. It was yours!

248
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,659
Well, that one there...

249
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:45,305
Well, Ludvo, Ludvo, will you stop
annoying me?

250
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:49,004
Frantisek, I won't until you
take our Ruzena.

251
00:21:56,063 --> 00:22:01,305
I can't believe it, mother.
You're so dumb, so dense.

252
00:22:01,514 --> 00:22:04,370
They're the ones stealing it,
damn it. It's them!

253
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:06,822
Well, you'll see.

254
00:22:13,456 --> 00:22:19,847
Leave me alone. Don't touch me.
Stop it. I tell you, stop it.

255
00:22:23,887 --> 00:22:28,292
Go away. Will you all please
go away? Don't stand there!

256
00:22:29,236 --> 00:22:31,850
What, don't you understand
the Czech language?

257
00:22:32,063 --> 00:22:34,274
What kind of discipline is this?
Go away!

258
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:46,257
I know a nice castle inn

259
00:22:46,462 --> 00:22:49,788
the vineyard, brook and forest
is whispering there

260
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:57,117
I know a nice castle inn
now it's called paradise

261
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:05,532
Near Kokorin, near Kokorin
I like to drink a bottle of wine

262
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:12,024
Near Kokorin, near Kokorin
is Catherine

263
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:14,881
And Catherine knows
how to make love

264
00:23:15,632 --> 00:23:20,196
A quick barmaid,
cleverly making her way

265
00:23:20,408 --> 00:23:23,562
Refusing everyone,
she knows what to do

266
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:27,535
As soon as I enter,
she looks at me

267
00:23:27,743 --> 00:23:31,676
The world turns round
and it's already May

268
00:23:32,251 --> 00:23:40,049
Near Kokorin, near Kokorin
I like to drink a bottle of wine

269
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:44,697
Near Kokorin, near Kokorin
is Catherine

270
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,331
Cmarada! Is that you?

271
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:50,914
Well, Cmarada!

272
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:04,372
Kavrik! Kavrik!

273
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:08,843
Miss, we are from
the entertainment committee

274
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:10,603
and we came to ask you
whether or not you would

275
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:12,525
participate in
the beauty contest...

276
00:24:12,727 --> 00:24:13,236
well, that...

277
00:24:13,443 --> 00:24:15,195
competition...

278
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:17,212
that competition...

279
00:24:17,772 --> 00:24:19,203
What do you want?

280
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:25,091
Whether you would like to enter
the beauty contest. See?

281
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:28,013
Wait.

282
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:30,036
What is it, gentlemen?
What do you want?

283
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:32,665
Well, wait, is this your girl?

284
00:24:34,044 --> 00:24:34,820
Come on!

285
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:37,878
Wait, wait, wait, we'll explain!

286
00:24:40,424 --> 00:24:40,965
Go on, explain then.

287
00:24:41,172 --> 00:24:43,276
Look here, is this your girl?

288
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:46,595
We want to ask her to enter
the beauty queen competition.

289
00:24:46,802 --> 00:24:47,765
Stop it. Stop it.

290
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:48,550
But wait.

291
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:50,274
Go on, man. Explain!

292
00:24:50,543 --> 00:24:51,608
That's what I'm trying to do.

293
00:24:51,813 --> 00:24:52,721
Explain.

294
00:24:53,082 --> 00:24:54,834
I am already explaining
for the second time.

295
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:55,909
Don't touch me!

296
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,721
Let him explain!

297
00:24:57,768 --> 00:24:58,577
Let me explain!

298
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,656
Go to hell!

299
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:18,590
I'll show you "shit on the
fire brigade" you hooligan!

300
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:20,678
Leave him alone, Franta!

301
00:25:35,912 --> 00:25:40,105
Yes, Zindulka! You never even
crossed my mind, man.

302
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:40,913
But...

303
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,415
You're back from the army
already?

304
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:46,246
Well, Zindulka...well...
what do you know!

305
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,111
What are you doing there?

306
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:56,788
Damn it, I can't find that paper,
that piece of paper

307
00:25:56,996 --> 00:25:58,726
with the list of the girls.

308
00:26:01,305 --> 00:26:07,946
Miss, get out of there and
be quick about it! Come on!

309
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,628
I tell you, get out of there!

310
00:26:22,155 --> 00:26:26,755
I'll have to call someone and
that would mean trouble for you,

311
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:30,603
unnecessary trouble. Please,
come out, will you?

312
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:16,840
What are you looking for
in my bag?

313
00:27:17,117 --> 00:27:18,881
What business is it of yours
what I've got there?

314
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:21,558
And why did you pull it out from
under the table?

315
00:27:23,532 --> 00:27:28,441
Everyone is stealing here and you
only watch, you old honest idiot.

316
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:30,338
Vrsecka.

317
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,074
Vrsecka. Vrsecka!

318
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:34,320
No, that one was really ugly.

319
00:27:34,526 --> 00:27:35,926
Well, we crossed her out, too.

320
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:38,492
Matejickova!

321
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:39,565
Matejickova!

322
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:42,469
Yes, Matejickova, put her down-
Matejickova, well...

323
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:49,188
All right, but in that case
we've only got one.

324
00:27:58,281 --> 00:27:59,943
Write her down...
Ruzena Metelkova.

325
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:01,245
I'll write her down.

326
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:08,030
Yes, but now we've
only got two.

327
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:09,533
Well, what is it, what is it?

328
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:11,644
Could I step out now?

329
00:28:12,048 --> 00:28:13,310
Step out now?

330
00:28:13,785 --> 00:28:17,189
Wait. Voting
for the beauty contest

331
00:28:17,392 --> 00:28:19,453
is supposed to take place now.

332
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:20,928
Yes, that's just it...

333
00:28:21,136 --> 00:28:22,900
I don't know, I don't know...

334
00:28:23,106 --> 00:28:26,568
I'm afraid I might do something
wrong, you know...

335
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:34,055
Wait. Perhaps nothing will happen
if you come back right away.

336
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:38,339
Thank you, but in that case
I prefer to hold on.

337
00:28:46,027 --> 00:28:48,998
Attention please!
Attention please!

338
00:28:50,136 --> 00:28:54,909
I ask all the chosen candidates
for the beauty queen contest...

339
00:28:55,116 --> 00:29:00,079
all these comrades should come
to the room behind the bar.

340
00:29:01,764 --> 00:29:03,928
I repeat: behind the bar!

341
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:31,389
Come in!

342
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:55,986
Stand over there
by the wall.

343
00:30:01,738 --> 00:30:05,041
Don't worry - they'll improve,
they'll improve.

344
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,690
Good day. I'm the mother.
And I came to have a look at you

345
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:16,599
and find out what this is all about.

346
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:19,175
My girl keeps talking about some
beauty queen and I think,

347
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,715
she is young, you know,
inexperienced,

348
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,290
somebody might get the better of her,
so I came to ask...

349
00:30:25,494 --> 00:30:27,395
to see...well, just to find out
what it's all about.

350
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,569
How nice that you came
to have a look.

351
00:30:31,776 --> 00:30:33,210
You're pleased that
we chose her, no?

352
00:30:33,413 --> 00:30:36,179
Well, if you like her,
I'll leave it up to you.

353
00:30:36,855 --> 00:30:39,654
Keep calm, mother,
everything's clean.

354
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:43,164
Well, I had to make sure.
What's a mother for?

355
00:30:43,535 --> 00:30:45,335
Just don't worry.

356
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:48,511
Take a good look at us,
you'll see that we couldn't...

357
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:52,148
Well, I'll call her.

358
00:30:54,763 --> 00:30:58,965
Hana, where are you?
Come here.

359
00:31:01,347 --> 00:31:05,514
Here she is. She's thin,
doesn't get enough to eat...

360
00:31:05,724 --> 00:31:08,752
But if she doesn't want to eat,
it's nobody's fault, is it?

361
00:31:09,097 --> 00:31:12,230
Stay here nicely and
stand up straight.

362
00:31:15,546 --> 00:31:17,242
Here she is then.

363
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:24,120
She won't leave, man.
She won't leave.

364
00:31:26,939 --> 00:31:29,274
That's all right mother,
you can go now.

365
00:31:29,678 --> 00:31:31,774
Let me stay here. I want to see
what's going to happen.

366
00:31:31,985 --> 00:31:33,784
I want to know what
you're going to do now.

367
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:37,252
No need not worry - nothing's
going to happen to her here.

368
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:40,765
And nothing will happen to you
either if you let me stay here.

369
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:46,551
Come in!

370
00:31:47,922 --> 00:31:49,151
Come in!

371
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:55,437
Come in, come in,
don't be afraid.

372
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:58,775
Go and stand over there
next to the girls.

373
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,533
Come in!

374
00:32:11,912 --> 00:32:16,753
Come in! Come in,
go and stand over there.

375
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:37,593
Good evening.

376
00:32:39,576 --> 00:32:41,706
Come in. Stand over there
next to...

377
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,984
That's not all. We said eight.

378
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:20,902
Yes, yes, yes, yes...oh yes.

379
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:36,140
She was behind the door.
She was behind the door.

380
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:37,970
I wasn't chosen.

381
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:40,912
Everything's all right.
Stand here.

382
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:42,180
Everything's all right.

383
00:33:59,966 --> 00:34:01,732
Well, start.

384
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,876
What am I supposed to start?

385
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,781
I'll start myself. I'll help you.

386
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:13,125
Come on.

387
00:34:18,912 --> 00:34:22,647
Girls, I welcome you on behalf
of the entertainment committee.

388
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:27,758
You were chosen as
the most beautiful at our ball.

389
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:30,365
Are you happy?

390
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:32,239
I wasn't chosen.

391
00:34:34,212 --> 00:34:37,814
I chose her myself.
I chose her myself.

392
00:34:39,192 --> 00:34:43,564
Now I'll tell you what we
are going to do in a little while

393
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:46,239
on the stage, okay?
Go on!

394
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,943
Girls.

395
00:35:15,477 --> 00:35:18,450
Tell that old bag to
go away. Tell her to go away.

396
00:35:18,953 --> 00:35:21,013
Somebody go and dance with her.
Go on, take her!

397
00:35:21,224 --> 00:35:22,283
Why me? He can go.

398
00:35:22,493 --> 00:35:23,689
Me again?

399
00:35:23,897 --> 00:35:24,989
Don't argue!

400
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:27,132
-Don't argue!
-Me again?

401
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,659
May I have the pleasure?

402
00:35:37,863 --> 00:35:42,202
Oh, sorry. Now it's getting
interesting. I'd like to see it.

403
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:44,104
-Go with him.
-Don't hurt his feelings.

404
00:35:44,313 --> 00:35:47,044
-Go and dance with him, lady.
-Only one round then.

405
00:35:47,252 --> 00:35:49,585
You wouldn't refuse him,
would you? Go on!

406
00:35:59,112 --> 00:36:00,604
Girls.

407
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:08,563
Attention!

408
00:36:14,284 --> 00:36:17,083
I'll show you a beauty queen,
you dirty geezers!

409
00:36:17,992 --> 00:36:20,017
Get out of here. Get out!

410
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,842
At ease!

411
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:35,861
Girls, I would like to point out
that the one

412
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,471
that is elected
beauty queen

413
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:41,603
will be given the honorary task

414
00:36:41,814 --> 00:36:46,188
of presenting this gift to our
former chairman,

415
00:36:46,391 --> 00:36:50,833
who will be
eighty-six years old.

416
00:36:51,638 --> 00:36:54,074
Eighty-six.

417
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:57,775
Continue.

418
00:36:58,186 --> 00:37:01,558
Well, I'II...I'll show them how
they should walk, yes?

419
00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:09,911
Look here girls, so that you
don't stroll in like a herd...

420
00:37:10,114 --> 00:37:14,955
You understand, yes?
Well, like that.

421
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:18,392
People will be watching you,

422
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:20,934
five hundred people
will be watching you.

423
00:37:21,141 --> 00:37:26,516
You must show all you can
so that we're not ashamed of you,

424
00:37:26,721 --> 00:37:28,211
so that they will not tell us
that we chose some...

425
00:37:28,691 --> 00:37:29,817
well, you understand?

426
00:37:30,027 --> 00:37:32,521
Take one step forward.

427
00:37:35,707 --> 00:37:38,976
Turn right.

428
00:37:40,452 --> 00:37:41,578
No, no.

429
00:37:42,122 --> 00:37:44,457
Turn left, turn left.

430
00:37:48,103 --> 00:37:52,341
Good evening...evening...
Excuse me for being late.

431
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:54,743
I went home to get
my bathing suit.

432
00:37:56,422 --> 00:37:57,117
What?

433
00:37:57,326 --> 00:37:58,383
Bathing suit.

434
00:37:59,932 --> 00:38:01,456
You've got it with you?

435
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,483
Wait!
What are you doing?

436
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,363
Leave her alone.

437
00:38:16,603 --> 00:38:18,163
But I can't let her undress here.

438
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,435
Why not?
They're also in bathing suits.

439
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,428
Hold the door so that nobody
comes in.

440
00:38:35,848 --> 00:38:36,906
Continue.

441
00:39:02,277 --> 00:39:04,439
You told her to bring
a bathing suit?

442
00:39:11,363 --> 00:39:14,997
Tell me, miss, who told you
to bring a bathing suit?

443
00:39:15,974 --> 00:39:16,941
Nobody.

444
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:24,218
Girls, nobody told you to bring
a bathing suit?

445
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:34,413
Why didn't you tell the others to?

446
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:37,952
Nobody told us anything.

447
00:39:43,237 --> 00:39:47,176
Miss, step a little further back,
will you?

448
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,352
Yes, further. further, further,
further. Stop. That will do

449
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,019
Try to hold a pose.

450
00:40:04,186 --> 00:40:05,551
Try something else.

451
00:40:17,984 --> 00:40:21,080
Miss, you over there.
Stand next to her.

452
00:40:27,707 --> 00:40:30,041
Take the same pose as her.

453
00:40:39,802 --> 00:40:43,503
That bathing suit looks
much better,

454
00:40:43,711 --> 00:40:45,440
but everyone should have one.

455
00:40:46,015 --> 00:40:49,580
There's something quite different
about that bathing suit...

456
00:40:52,298 --> 00:40:54,597
All right, all right.
Go back to your places.

457
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,181
And now you can continue
practicing your march.

458
00:41:04,224 --> 00:41:09,464
Girls, attention!
Left! Left! Left!

459
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,979
Left!

460
00:41:17,355 --> 00:41:22,022
A bit lively! Look at me,
damn it!

461
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:26,000
Well, girls, smile,
look happy, happy...

462
00:41:27,845 --> 00:41:34,588
Happy, happy, one, two,
one, two...

463
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:37,562
And smile...happily, smile.

464
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:41,709
Smile, girls.
Left, left, smile.

465
00:41:54,273 --> 00:41:56,903
Send a kiss to the audience.

466
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,182
Damn it, girls, a kiss...there!

467
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:02,787
A nice kiss.

468
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:08,706
A kiss, kiss, well,
you know how.

469
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,719
One two, one two,...
Nice, girls!

470
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,746
Get dressed, quickly.

471
00:42:27,585 --> 00:42:30,111
Take your places like before.

472
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,164
Hurry up, hurry up,
I tell you!

473
00:42:45,024 --> 00:42:46,390
Hurry...Jesus Christ...

474
00:42:54,914 --> 00:42:55,710
Come in!

475
00:42:55,982 --> 00:42:57,040
Come in!

476
00:43:02,097 --> 00:43:03,154
What are you doing here?

477
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:15,684
Where did you leave that
old woman?

478
00:43:16,129 --> 00:43:17,427
Zeminek took her from me.

479
00:43:17,632 --> 00:43:21,504
You are such an idiot,
such an idiot.

480
00:43:21,742 --> 00:43:26,080
Me again? Me again?

481
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:52,269
And now, at last, the long
awaited moment has come.

482
00:43:52,481 --> 00:43:56,318
We shall now elect the
beauty queen.

483
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:08,045
She will then hand over
an honorary present

484
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,815
to our former chairman.

485
00:44:20,112 --> 00:44:27,184
Now I ask the chosen candidates
to come to the stage.

486
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:29,487
Music!

487
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:00,223
I tell you, I tell you,
keep calm.

488
00:45:00,438 --> 00:45:03,135
Stand here. I'll tell you
when to go.

489
00:45:04,847 --> 00:45:09,016
Comrade candidates, please
come up here to the stage.

490
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:30,203
What's the matter
with those girls?

491
00:45:30,406 --> 00:45:30,962
I don't know.

492
00:45:31,174 --> 00:45:32,004
Where are they?

493
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:38,852
Is somebody going to come
up here?

494
00:45:40,463 --> 00:45:41,487
Ruzena!

495
00:45:42,268 --> 00:45:46,504
Stop this nonsense!
Come up here! Girls!

496
00:45:54,662 --> 00:45:56,460
Clap your hands, mother!

497
00:46:01,511 --> 00:46:04,038
Please don't clap. That does
not belong in the competition.

498
00:46:04,317 --> 00:46:06,481
Why are you clapping?
It's pointless.

499
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:09,453
Go on, clap your hands!

500
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,299
Please come up here
and stop bowing.

501
00:46:14,509 --> 00:46:16,375
Don't waste any more time!

502
00:46:18,852 --> 00:46:19,784
Not yet.

503
00:46:24,633 --> 00:46:26,033
Not yet.

504
00:46:31,114 --> 00:46:33,106
Not yet.

505
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:36,858
Now, now.

506
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:38,796
Damn it!

507
00:46:51,495 --> 00:46:55,595
Next one, please, come up here!

508
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:19,548
Strike up the band!

509
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:25,467
Continue, please. Continue!

510
00:47:28,548 --> 00:47:31,542
Go on, go on up there!

511
00:47:34,392 --> 00:47:35,520
Music, what is it?

512
00:47:35,729 --> 00:47:36,696
We're supposed to play alone?

513
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:37,831
Of course.

514
00:47:45,486 --> 00:47:46,510
I'm going over there!

515
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:54,528
Bartosova, I see you!

516
00:48:14,888 --> 00:48:16,150
Miss!

517
00:48:23,005 --> 00:48:24,497
Misses!

518
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:30,383
I wasn't chosen! I wasn't chosen!
I wasn't chosen!

519
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:32,787
That doesn't matter. Come on,
come on!

520
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:34,899
I won't!

521
00:48:55,982 --> 00:48:59,614
I wasn't chosen either!
Let me go!

522
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:13,015
Ruzena, Ruzena, come back!
Ruzena, come back!

523
00:49:24,346 --> 00:49:25,815
No you don't!

524
00:49:29,794 --> 00:49:34,063
We want the queen!
We want the queen!

525
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,998
We want the queen!

526
00:49:37,276 --> 00:49:39,180
Girls, open the door!
Stop this nonsense! Girls!

527
00:49:40,218 --> 00:49:42,347
Ladies, come out!

528
00:49:43,325 --> 00:49:45,886
Be sensible, I beg you!

529
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:02,562
Stop being silly!

530
00:50:03,471 --> 00:50:05,030
Ladies, come out!

531
00:50:05,342 --> 00:50:07,003
Quiet!

532
00:50:08,082 --> 00:50:09,606
Come out, ladies!

533
00:50:09,952 --> 00:50:11,510
Be quiet!

534
00:50:12,861 --> 00:50:13,759
Tell them to come out.

535
00:50:22,217 --> 00:50:25,655
Quiet! Stop playing! Quiet!
Stop that! Stop playing!

536
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,201
Will you be quiet! Quiet!

537
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:43,187
Fire! Fire!

538
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:55,446
Please pay here! Jesus Christ,
your bill please!

539
00:50:56,527 --> 00:50:58,997
Tell me what you had!

540
00:50:59,334 --> 00:51:02,899
You there, what did you have?
What did you have?

541
00:51:03,475 --> 00:51:05,945
And what did you have?
Have some sense, for God's sake!

542
00:51:06,785 --> 00:51:10,987
Come back! Have some sense!
You ani...animals!

543
00:51:13,033 --> 00:51:19,502
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Come and help us!

544
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,412
Come and help us!
Come and help us!

545
00:52:31,614 --> 00:52:35,246
No, I don't want to go out,
I don't want to.

546
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:37,219
I've got my things in there!

547
00:52:43,475 --> 00:52:45,637
Everyone out! Everyone out!

548
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:48,858
No! Let me be!

549
00:52:49,026 --> 00:52:51,578
Hold him, someone, please!
Hold him!

550
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,574
Make room here.

551
00:52:54,148 --> 00:52:56,006
Stop, granddad. Wait!

552
00:52:56,545 --> 00:52:58,301
Your bill. Young man,
what did you have?

553
00:52:58,507 --> 00:52:59,935
One lemonade.

554
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:03,988
Let me smell your breath...
seventy-five hellers.

555
00:53:04,295 --> 00:53:06,018
Next one please. Your bill!

556
00:53:13,311 --> 00:53:17,494
Don't let him stand here!
Sit down, old man.

557
00:53:18,435 --> 00:53:19,988
Slowly, slowly...

558
00:53:25,222 --> 00:53:27,512
Slowly, well...
go a little further, lady.

559
00:53:27,716 --> 00:53:30,801
I'm standing here so that he
doesn't see his house on fire.

560
00:53:31,011 --> 00:53:33,029
You would let him watch it.

561
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:36,526
Turn him around. How stupid.

562
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:38,557
Turn around, granddad.

563
00:53:43,122 --> 00:53:46,103
Sit down, sit down!
Slowly...like that...

564
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:48,501
He's looking anyway.

565
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:51,233
Well, it's no wonder - his house
is on fire.

566
00:53:51,503 --> 00:53:53,656
Are you cold, granddad?

567
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:56,127
Let's get closer to the fire,
okay?

568
00:53:57,925 --> 00:54:00,509
Get up, granddad.
We're moving closer.

569
00:54:08,771 --> 00:54:11,096
Damn it, man, I'm hot!

570
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:17,642
Sit down, granddad. You won't
feel cold here.

571
00:54:19,584 --> 00:54:22,373
Damn it, don't look over there
all the time!

572
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:27,893
Granddad, I'm borrowing your table.

573
00:54:37,282 --> 00:54:39,243
Girls, don't look at the fire
and come on!

574
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:42,431
Give me some beer and take out
the cups.

575
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:48,292
Give me that plum brandy and
something to open it with.

576
00:55:11,714 --> 00:55:14,935
Come and stand over here. There's
enough for everybody.

577
00:55:16,174 --> 00:55:18,190
Waiter, two beers please.

578
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,191
Take your place in line,
take your place.

579
00:56:01,952 --> 00:56:06,102
Granddad, have some.
You're cold.

580
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:13,983
Give us our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

581
00:56:14,227 --> 00:56:17,706
as we forgive those
who trespass against us

582
00:56:17,987 --> 00:56:20,708
and do not lead us into
temptation

583
00:56:21,214 --> 00:56:24,263
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.

584
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:31,755
Father, give me the helmet.

585
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:34,351
I won't, I won't.

586
00:56:34,554 --> 00:56:38,104
I'll give you a scarf.
It'll be cold in the morning.

587
00:56:38,314 --> 00:56:42,565
But what will I look like in
a scarf? Like an old woman.

588
00:56:42,772 --> 00:56:44,132
You're an old man, aren't you?

589
00:56:44,336 --> 00:56:45,854
I am.

590
00:56:46,133 --> 00:56:49,183
Well, then,
what's the difference?

591
00:56:49,393 --> 00:56:51,353
Yes, but you are an old man,
So we'll put it there.

592
00:56:51,554 --> 00:56:55,275
Keep it. It's beginning to freeze
and you're sweating.

593
00:56:55,481 --> 00:56:56,500
Bye.

594
00:56:56,812 --> 00:56:59,862
You'll get sick -
just keep it.

595
00:57:00,438 --> 00:57:03,865
-All right. Thank you.
-Button up your coat.

596
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,819
Tell them to send
someone in the morning.

597
00:57:06,061 --> 00:57:08,986
I will. Good night.

598
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,481
And watch carefully, father!

599
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:42,884
We've got another...

600
00:57:43,188 --> 00:57:46,738
Thank you very much.
Anyone else, please?

601
00:57:48,577 --> 00:57:52,057
Thank you.
Thank you very much, too.

602
00:57:52,704 --> 00:57:56,253
Thank you, you are very kind.
I'm collecting...

603
00:57:56,463 --> 00:57:58,582
give something...the poor man,
let him win something too.

604
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:00,751
He lost everything
in the fire.

605
00:58:00,955 --> 00:58:02,314
He has nothing.
Thank you.

606
00:58:02,518 --> 00:58:07,904
Father! Father, come here!

607
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:11,665
He's not moving, damn it!

608
00:58:11,867 --> 00:58:13,295
What is it, lady? What's up?

609
00:58:13,562 --> 00:58:15,955
Those people are collecting
lottery tickets for the one

610
00:58:16,157 --> 00:58:18,119
whose house burned down.

611
00:58:19,551 --> 00:58:20,877
So?

612
00:58:21,347 --> 00:58:25,067
Well, it should be stopped.
Come here!

613
00:58:25,273 --> 00:58:27,235
Well, why?

614
00:58:27,435 --> 00:58:29,023
Because the prizes
were all stolen.

615
00:58:29,231 --> 00:58:31,023
Come here!

616
00:58:34,654 --> 00:58:39,099
We can't leave him like that.
I'm chasing the boys away.

617
00:58:39,313 --> 00:58:41,500
They're showing up without ties.
Such hooligans.

618
00:58:41,709 --> 00:58:43,897
Am I supposed to
leave him there in his drawers?

619
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:47,289
Have some sense.
That's impossible.

620
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:50,881
But what will we do with him
if he's got nothing else?

621
00:58:51,089 --> 00:58:57,803
I agree - he can't help it.
Then what am I here for?

622
00:58:58,043 --> 00:59:03,396
Well? What for? In that case
I don't need to be here at all.

623
00:59:03,965 --> 00:59:06,618
It's useless...absolutely...

624
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,634
Excuse me, excuse me.

625
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:47,805
Granddad, allow me to thank
all those present here,

626
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,332
in the ballroom,
on your behalf.

627
00:59:50,641 --> 00:59:56,493
And allow me, on your behalf,
to hand over to Mr. Havelka

628
00:59:56,829 --> 01:00:02,307
the beautiful result
of our...our...

629
01:00:02,584 --> 01:00:03,841
Collection.

630
01:00:04,182 --> 01:00:11,395
Yes, sure, collection, but
I thought that the collection

631
01:00:11,602 --> 01:00:16,282
was the result of our...

632
01:00:17,445 --> 01:00:18,534
Goodness!

633
01:00:19,078 --> 01:00:21,408
Of course, also goodness,
but that's not it.

634
01:00:21,612 --> 01:00:23,876
That's something else.

635
01:00:24,548 --> 01:00:28,505
It's on the tip of my tongue
but I can't remember. Our...

636
01:00:28,716 --> 01:00:30,238
Kindness?

637
01:00:30,452 --> 01:00:34,818
Of course, kindness too.
Kindness, goodness...

638
01:00:35,021 --> 01:00:37,509
but that's still not it. It is...

639
01:00:37,722 --> 01:00:39,950
Solidarity?
Just say it, you idiot.

640
01:00:40,157 --> 01:00:44,488
Solidarity...yes, solidarity.
That's the right word for it.

641
01:00:44,693 --> 01:00:48,888
And therefore allow me
on your behalf to hand over

642
01:00:49,094 --> 01:00:53,687
to Mr. Havelka,
with whom we sympathize,

643
01:00:53,897 --> 01:00:58,388
this beautiful expression
of our solidarity.

644
01:01:13,641 --> 01:01:19,100
That's not money. Those are
only papers.

645
01:01:19,312 --> 01:01:24,439
Those are the lottery tickets.
For these you can win

646
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:27,012
a lot of nice things
in the lottery.

647
01:01:27,215 --> 01:01:33,742
But I need money. I don't need this.
I need money.

648
01:01:34,354 --> 01:01:37,149
But this is like money, Dad.

649
01:01:37,589 --> 01:01:40,111
Just a moment, please.
It'll be alright.

650
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:41,982
Everything will be alright.
Quiet, please!

651
01:01:48,894 --> 01:01:51,828
Friends! Please give me
your attention.

652
01:01:52,929 --> 01:01:54,953
Something unpleasant
happened to us.

653
01:01:55,898 --> 01:01:59,263
I don't want
to make a big deal out of it here.

654
01:02:00,568 --> 01:02:04,433
Somebody took a number of
prizes from our lottery.

655
01:02:04,903 --> 01:02:06,959
We cannot continue.

656
01:02:07,905 --> 01:02:13,339
We will now put the lights out.
It's going to be dark.

657
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:18,134
The one who took
the things will bring them back.

658
01:02:18,344 --> 01:02:21,310
Not yet! Don't put
the lights out! Not yet!

659
01:02:21,511 --> 01:02:24,570
I have not finished yet!
Put the lights back on!

660
01:02:24,779 --> 01:02:27,303
Don't switch them off!
Put the lights back on!

661
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:42,289
What...what's that?
A misunderstanding!

662
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:48,620
Some jokers! I said
quite clearly: It will be dark

663
01:02:48,827 --> 01:02:51,452
when the lights go out
and whoever took the things

664
01:02:51,662 --> 01:02:55,096
will bring them back and
not the other way around!

665
01:02:55,298 --> 01:03:02,599
Not the other way around!
Once more! Lights out!

666
01:03:31,417 --> 01:03:34,851
Put that chair in the right
place! Come on!

667
01:03:35,919 --> 01:03:37,476
Put something under his head!

668
01:03:37,687 --> 01:03:39,209
Carefully, carefully. Boys,
carefully.

669
01:03:39,421 --> 01:03:40,478
Put something under his head.

670
01:03:40,688 --> 01:03:42,450
A bit further, a bit further.

671
01:03:42,657 --> 01:03:44,520
Put something...
wait, lift him up.

672
01:03:44,792 --> 01:03:46,222
Take the tie...

673
01:03:46,492 --> 01:03:48,116
Yes...

674
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,855
Put him down, like that...

675
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:56,764
You old idiot, you...

676
01:03:56,967 --> 01:03:57,991
Stop it! Stop it!

677
01:03:58,203 --> 01:03:59,569
Why did you return it?

678
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:00,967
Stop it, please!

679
01:04:02,345 --> 01:04:03,781
Why did that fool return it?

680
01:04:03,983 --> 01:04:05,975
But what?

681
01:04:06,455 --> 01:04:08,789
He shouldn't have returned it!
He shouldn't...

682
01:04:08,995 --> 01:04:11,487
It will make everyone laugh.

683
01:04:11,835 --> 01:04:13,667
It looks as if we had taken
and eaten everything!

684
01:04:13,871 --> 01:04:16,708
Don't get excited, damn it.
Give him a break!

685
01:04:16,913 --> 01:04:20,284
What break?
He's an idiot and...

686
01:04:20,487 --> 01:04:21,316
and shouldn't
have returned it.

687
01:04:21,523 --> 01:04:24,928
He did and we must
deal with it.

688
01:04:25,132 --> 01:04:26,691
Let him have a rest and
stop worrying!

689
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,338
What are you going
to do about it?

690
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:30,442
We'll solve it somehow,
but not by quarreling.

691
01:04:30,645 --> 01:04:33,674
I can't bear it, Joska...
that scandal.

692
01:04:34,152 --> 01:04:35,644
What scandal are you
talking about?

693
01:04:35,857 --> 01:04:37,416
It will shame the whole
fire brigade.

694
01:04:37,628 --> 01:04:38,356
Don't quarrel!

695
01:04:38,562 --> 01:04:40,190
It's hopeless.

696
01:04:40,401 --> 01:04:44,603
Shut up! I'll tell you
something. If you were

697
01:04:44,811 --> 01:04:48,215
in the same situation, you
would have returned it too,

698
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,852
because you're honest.

699
01:04:51,628 --> 01:04:57,595
Never! In this situation,
never. Remember that.

700
01:04:57,808 --> 01:05:00,747
The good name of the
fire brigade means more to me

701
01:05:00,948 --> 01:05:03,613
than any honesty, you pighead!

702
01:05:03,822 --> 01:05:05,381
The name of the fire brigade...

703
01:05:05,592 --> 01:05:08,030
I'll tell you what our
good name depends on.

704
01:05:08,533 --> 01:05:10,263
Our good name depends

705
01:05:10,471 --> 01:05:12,236
on how
we handle the lottery.

706
01:05:14,313 --> 01:05:18,687
What are we going to do about it?
That's quite clear.

707
01:05:19,758 --> 01:05:22,628
What's clear about it?
To you everything is clear.

708
01:05:22,832 --> 01:05:26,169
Of course. What will you do?
The lottery has been stolen.

709
01:05:27,141 --> 01:05:31,981
Gentlemen, there is one fact:
If the people stole it,

710
01:05:32,321 --> 01:05:33,880
they cannot win it.

711
01:05:34,092 --> 01:05:35,721
Don't talk like that, Joska.

712
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:37,990
What about those people who
bought the tickets honestly

713
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:40,262
and didn't steal anything?

714
01:05:41,475 --> 01:05:43,138
They should have stolen.

715
01:05:44,883 --> 01:05:46,785
Whoever didn't steal
must understand it

716
01:05:46,988 --> 01:05:47,920
as if he just
didn't win anything.

717
01:05:48,357 --> 01:05:53,129
Stop this nonsense.
Something else is at stake.

718
01:05:54,873 --> 01:05:58,040
What should we do with
those who stole

719
01:05:58,248 --> 01:05:59,877
and did not buy any tickets?

720
01:06:00,086 --> 01:06:03,114
That is really sleazy.
That's impossible.

721
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,455
We'll find out,
we'll find out.

722
01:06:05,664 --> 01:06:07,827
But how will you find out
who it was?

723
01:06:08,137 --> 01:06:09,400
Everyone's gone.

724
01:06:10,042 --> 01:06:12,171
Wait a minute, boys,
wait a minute.

725
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:17,587
We must consider that everyone
at our ball bought at least

726
01:06:17,794 --> 01:06:24,138
one ticket. There is no thief
without a ticket.

727
01:06:24,809 --> 01:06:28,977
Yes, that's where we must start,
That's it.

728
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:37,164
Alright, we'll start from there,
but the people are waiting there

729
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:39,972
so we have to tell them.

730
01:06:40,546 --> 01:06:43,073
What do you want to tell them?

731
01:06:43,485 --> 01:06:45,819
I don't know
what you would tell them.

732
01:06:46,025 --> 01:06:48,359
You remind me of Jesus Christ -

733
01:06:48,564 --> 01:06:50,660
You want to explain something to
somebody all the time!

734
01:06:51,271 --> 01:06:57,775
The lottery is gone. All the
people were there.

735
01:06:58,021 --> 01:07:02,051
Everyone is under suspicion,
so they should keep their mouths shut.

736
01:07:02,664 --> 01:07:05,726
And that's important, that all
of them are under suspicion.

737
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,805
That is not true!
That is not true!

738
01:07:08,344 --> 01:07:09,972
But there is something to it.

739
01:07:10,181 --> 01:07:12,150
True, true.

740
01:07:13,021 --> 01:07:14,489
It's not true.

741
01:07:16,596 --> 01:07:19,066
Alright, but somebody must
tell them, damn it.

742
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:20,931
What should we tell them?

743
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:23,266
That they are all
under suspicion.

744
01:07:23,847 --> 01:07:29,620
Guys, I don't know about you.
I could tell them myself

745
01:07:30,961 --> 01:07:34,664
that it's nothing, but I think
it's pointless.

746
01:07:34,871 --> 01:07:36,807
I don't know. Pointless?

747
01:07:37,243 --> 01:07:39,236
Well...no point to it.

748
01:07:39,515 --> 01:07:41,850
The people know well enough
if they took it

749
01:07:42,055 --> 01:07:45,459
that they couldn't win it
and they also know

750
01:07:45,663 --> 01:07:47,793
that they are all under
suspicion.

751
01:07:48,771 --> 01:07:52,336
People are not stupid. No,
they are not stupid.

752
01:07:52,545 --> 01:07:56,178
Gentlemen, don't underestimate
those people.

753
01:07:56,387 --> 01:07:58,951
Don't underestimate them.
We must trust the people.

754
01:07:59,462 --> 01:08:02,696
Yes, not underestimate.
We must trust the people.

755
01:08:03,003 --> 01:08:05,199
Really...I'd prefer five fires
to that.

756
01:08:05,275 --> 01:08:08,510
Why did that fool return
this headcheese? Why?

757
01:08:08,949 --> 01:08:10,178
Stop it! Stop it!

758
01:08:11,523 --> 01:08:13,926
Quiet. Wait!

759
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,530
What is it?

760
01:08:19,707 --> 01:08:21,074
Quiet.

761
01:08:32,104 --> 01:08:33,596
What is this?

762
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:36,537
Quiet!
Somebody go and have a look.

763
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:59,768
Chairman, you must forgive us
for coming a little late.

764
01:10:00,142 --> 01:10:03,912
But you know...
after the fire...

765
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:08,487
But all the more if it comes
from our hearts, right boys?

766
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:14,231
I give you the present
you justly deserve.

767
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,205
Please, take it.

768
01:10:16,411 --> 01:10:23,724
Friends, I would like to thank
the fire brigade of which

769
01:10:23,931 --> 01:10:31,038
I have been the chairman
for many years...

770
01:10:31,247 --> 01:10:36,212
I would like to thank all of you
for this present and honor.

771
01:10:36,424 --> 01:10:41,767
I am very happy that at
the end of my life,

772
01:10:41,973 --> 01:10:45,139
I have received such
a great honor.

773
01:10:45,345 --> 01:10:48,375
Thank you all
for the kind help

774
01:10:48,587 --> 01:10:55,524
and support
you gave me in my work.

775
01:10:56,038 --> 01:11:04,120
You have helped me achieve this honor
of being awarded this precious present,

776
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:11,393
this beautiful present...

777
