THREE VETERANS

3
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,869
When we set marching
far out beyond Prague

4
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,869
we'll meet the Turkish army, love...

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,672
we'll meet the Turkish army, love...

6
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,671
Stop!
Stop!

7
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,352
What's up?
- Look!

8
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,952
Look at that!

9
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,638
So what?
A beggar.

10
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,074
It's the same one!

11
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,510
An old campaigner.
Aveteran, huh?

12
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,239
You'll got to be one too.

13
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,752
He's got a medal anďs out begging.

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,152
So will you be.

15
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,232
Don't say such things.

16
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,392
Play for us!

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,479

Youth, glory,

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,760
money...
- Didn't you hear?

20
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,035
Play another song!
- I have no ther song.

21
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,917
Better none at all, then.

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,272
You shouldn't have done that.

23
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,750
Come on, I'm thirsty!

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,713
Buy another one!

25
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,673
Let's go!

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,270
I'll just buy a new handle,
you save up for a barrel-organ.

The old geyser was right.

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,991
We've got no roof over our heads,

64
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,316
holes in our boots

65
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,712
and a rumbling tum.

66
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,591
Got a light, Butch?

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,075
Hey, Butch, got a light?

68
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,871
My name isn't Butch.
- I know that you are Pankrac.

69
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,633
It's shorter than Pankrac.
Give me a light!

70
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,674
Thanks.
Seen my two brothers around?

71
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,399
E... e...
- Well, yeah.

72
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,472
Never mind, they'll be along.

73
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,359
Want a cigar?

74
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,119
I'm not supposed to smoke.

75
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,673
What I need is coffee.
- You wish.

76
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,550
With rum or without?
- Is that a joke?

77
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,999
Not a bad one, either.

78
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,913
There.

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,433
Sugar's in it.

80
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,592
Rum, as well?
Damnit.

81
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,673
What'll you eat?
Bread, buns,

82
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,955
or a piece of cake?
- The cake.

83
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,711
Brambalabum.

84
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,119
As you wish.

85
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,230
I like to see people happy.

86
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,354
Laughter's the loveliest music.

87
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,074
Laugh till your belly shakes!

88
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,916
You must be a docent sort
if you can laugh like that.

89
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,269
I've got to wake my mates.

90
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,517
No, let them sleep.

91
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,078
Here,

92
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,238
have this!
- Just a minute!

93
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,039
Is it okay?

94
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,999
Too small.
- And now?

95
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,754
Where are you,
I can't see a thing!

96
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,559
Chm!
And now?

97
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,596
Now it's just right.
- Oh, great!

98
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,796
Fine, it's yours.
Bye!

99
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,711
Should my brothers turn up,

100
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,836
I'll be waiting under the nose-tree.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,958
Where?
- Like a fig-tree,

102
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,678
only this is a nose-tree.

103
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,157
They know where.
Under the nose-tree.

104
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,793
Where else would I be waiting?

105
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,109
Life isn't fun
all the time,

106
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,829
but some of the time some of the fun
please let be mine!

107
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,629
The gold can be thine,

108
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,349
but friends...
...must be mine!

109
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,112
You sing well, little man.

110
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,313
What a praise!

111
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,472
Such praise deserves a reward.

112
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,995
Catch!

113
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,678
Hop-hop!
Hop!

114
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,436
How much is in there?
- No end to them!

115
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,358
Like it?
- Who wouldn't?

116
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,758
Me.
Eh, hop!

117
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,640
Look.
You keep it!

118
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,835
Hop!

119
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,236
What'll you do without money?

120
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,634
I'll shake some out for you.

121
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,956
Bad, not bad - okay?

122
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,595
Right?
- Yeah.

123
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,830
Come on.
Bad - not bad.

124
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,753
Right.

125
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,159
Having no money?
- That's bad.

126
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,755
Not bad!

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,719
Having no heart?
- Not bad.

128
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,875
That's bad!

129
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,272
Being in trouble?
- Is bad.

130
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,953
Not that bad!

131
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,798
Being bored?
- Not bad.

132
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,953
That is bad!
Is bad!

133
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,714
Hey you, Servac...
- Yeah?

134
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,836
Should my older brother look for me,

135
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,753
or

136
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,314
the younger one,

137
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,598
tell him...
...or tell them both

138
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,194
to come and join me.

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,949
Life isn't fun all the time,

140
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,629
but some of the time some of the fun
please be mine!

141
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,199
Whatcher want, titch?

142
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,114
Want me to blow?

143
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,713
You don't need to tell me.
Well, that I didn't know

144
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,473
that there are deaf-and-dumb dwarfs
around!

145
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,279
You hear but cannot speak?

146
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,233
Yes, we need more wood,
but dry wood.

147
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,793
Everything's damp in the forest.

148
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,119
That's enough.

149
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,477
A nice toy.

150
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,357
The things one could do with it.

151
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,595
Here you are.

152
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,239
I'm to keep it?

153
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,793
Thanks.

154
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,199
Cherio, dwarf!

155
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,399
Oh, not Mr. Servac,

156
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,399
he prefers tea and cake.

157
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,950
Get up!

158
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,317
Breakfast's ready!

159
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,120
Oh, cake!
- What do you say now?

160
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,316
Where did you?
Good.

161
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,558
If you knew what happened to me!

162
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,119
But what happened to me!

163
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,953
Such a titch came up...
- Mine was even titchier.

164
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,034
Had blond curls.
- No he didn't.

165
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,270
Bad a long cigar.
- No he didn't!

166
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,239
It was another one, then.

167
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,433
Look at that.

168
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,956
Why stay here, mates?

169
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,429
Why are we rotting in the woods?
Let's march off into the unknown.

170
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,433
March?

171
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,791
We'll ride!

172
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,955
What?

173
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,837
Climb in, gentleman!

174
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,550
Great horses.
I love browns.

175
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,119
That was a good trick.

176
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,232
Soft seats,
four horse-power!

177
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,875
A carriage.

178
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,473
Looks like something's wrong.

179
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,194
When I want a carriage.
I want it on the road!

180
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,115
Ah, yes.

181
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,712
I've never worked with these.

182
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,673
There's no instruction leaflet.

183
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,833
Wait.

184
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,671
Whack the whip.

185
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,639
Don't be stupid,
we'll get a driver.

186
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,479
What's your name?
- Whatever you want it to be.

187
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,558
So you'll be Matt.
Go!

188
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,310
No, you'll be Hans.

189
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,319
Germans are tidy people.

190
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,793
Go, Hans!

191
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,199
Isn't it wonderful!

192
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,319
But what'll we do?

193
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,999
I'd like to go fishing.

194
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,956
Let's just laze around,

195
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,753
for five, six years,

196
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,310
then we'll see.
- No,

197
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,312
a soldier revisits places
where he spillt blood.

198
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,436
But why?
Why doesn't he go fishing?

199
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,753
Because he's a soldier.

200
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,753
Not any longer.
We are veteran soldiers!

201
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,434
Don't you forget that!
We're veterans.

202
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,670
We're going fishing.
- No excuses.

203
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,317
Off we go!
To the battlefield!

204
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,997
Stop!
Halt!

205
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,433
That's where it was.

206
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,553
What are you doing with my horse?

207
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,509
Watch this.
There were ten Mohammedans.

208
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,911
I had five men left,
and one seribe.

209
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,673
That's them.

210
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,039
The Turks thought they could do
anything.

211
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,756
Hey, mister!
This is my horse, and my field!

212
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,956
Go away, there'll be shooting.

213
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,390
But I've sown.

214
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,428
Let's go away,
he's sown.

215
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,438
We can't.
This is the battlefield.

216
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,118
Here's the battle.

217
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,793
Mind out, civilian!
- Ouch!

218
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,233
Now I'll show you
how I do with superior forces!

219
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,353
Wait and see, you Turks!

220
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,314
There'll be wheat here.
- There'll be a battle here.

221
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,513
I'm not interested in wheat.

222
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,439
Seram, civilian!

223
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,509
Damm it all!
We can't have this,

224
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,399
no we can't!

225
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,475
Look what happens

226
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,552
when I strum up 20 men!

227
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,399
Please!
Can I go?

228
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,670
No, write it up for history.

229
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,713
The whole victorious battle.

230
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,839
Got ready!

231
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,790
Arms ready!
- Stop it!

232
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,796
Hey, look!
You're scaring the kids.

233
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,510
So what.
Fire!

234
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,749
Come along, children.

235
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,238
Seize the fire!

236
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,632
Don't fire!

237
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,349
Fire and hack away!

238
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,673
They're giving up!

239
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,279
What are you doing?

240
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,150
How can you shoot at someone
who's giving in?

241
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,033
What a mean thing to do!

242
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,951
Get down!
Shame on you!

243
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,752
We'll show you yet!

244
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,878
We'll show you yet!

245
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,750
We'll show you yet!
- Now look at us.

246
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,151
Had we just lazed around
as I suggested,

247
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,359
we'd be better off.

248
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,112
Laze around then.

249
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,671
There's straw, mice too -
three's a lucky number.

250
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,312
I wanted to go fishing,

251
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,029
not into battle like you.

252
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,838
Wearing your uniform?

253
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,428
That's true, why not civies?

254
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,631
I don't know how else to dress up.

255
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,676
Been wearing uniform all my life.

256
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,597
They don't know
I've got a secret weapon.

257
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,671
I can do...

258
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,674
I can do anything with.
I'll make the whole world stand in line.

259
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,433
I'll set up an invincible army

260
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,237
and a navy

261
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,594
and set things straight
on land and sea.

262
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,595
He's crackers.

263
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,749
The we at thing a guy can want,
to save the world by force.

264
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,438
A dangerous illness.

265
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,598
What do we do with him?
- We'll marry him off.

266
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,435
Hurray!
Forwards!

267
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,232
Evil must be hounded out by evil.

268
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,952
What's the bride to be like?

269
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,310
Half angel half bitch.

270
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,628
He won't want just anyone,

271
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,792
now he rules the world.

272
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,358
A Princess at least.

273
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,392
So we find him a Princess.

274
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,669
An angel of a bitch.
She'll tame him.

275
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,192
She'll keep him straight.

276
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,310
Get up, you're getting married.
Wake him up!

277
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,472
Get up, you're getting married.
- I see.

278
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,552
Now?
Here?

279
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,679
To whom?
- First let's get out of here.

280
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,954
Who can think of something?
- Not me.

281
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,389
I'll show you how
to escape from a jail.

282
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,032
Break it in two.
Hey!

283
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,876
Break it in two!

284
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,199
Excuse me.

285
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,875
Che!

286
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,471
I thought of that too
but I thought I'd make it harder.

287
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,275
Come on.
Let it be.

288
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,192
Come on!
- What's up?

289
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,439
Quickly!

290
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,952
Goddamnit!
Come on!

291
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,039
What's wrong?

292
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,878
Move, Liza!
I'm coming.

293
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,390
The sleigh-party's gone?

294
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,319
Yes.

295
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,598
First a sleigh, now a carriage.

296
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,359
A lot of traffic today.

297
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,077
Well...
- Well, yeah.

298
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,359
Got any cigarettes?

299
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,079
Which do you like?

300
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,119
These with the camel.

301
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,959
Confiscated.

302
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,873
Any more camels?

303
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,715
Yeah.

304
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,959
Confiscated too.

305
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,395
More!

306
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,636
We'd be here till morning.

307
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,359
Here - and open up!

308
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,633
Did you paint that, customs-man?

309
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,992
Yes Sir,
and it's for sale.

310
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,832
Who is it?
- Bosanna.

311
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,828
Are her eyes that far apart?

312
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,599
Even further, Sir.

313
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,279
An angelic little bitch.

314
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,272
Where does she live
and where are weddings hold?

315
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,438
She's a Princess!

316
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,193
Three pieces of gold for and it's yours.

317
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,795
No!

318
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,315
More.

319
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,077
We'll go and find her.
Come on!

320
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,155
Come on!

321
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,838
Yeah.
Yeah?

322
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,434
I got you.
Three people, one driver, four horses.

323
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,359
You don't say.

324
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,759
Oh, come on!
Under his hat?

325
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,359
With a camel?

326
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,279
Be seeing you.

327
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,029
Welcome, gentlemen,
my name's Vulture.

328
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,920
I'm sure,
You'll want to stay with me.

329
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,958
There is no other hotel.

330
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,833
No choice, then.
Is your place clean?

331
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,918
It's an all-category hotel.

332
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,914
Third with bed-bugs,
second without bed-bugs,

333
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,195
first with coat-hangers.

334
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,920
We'll take first.
- The luggage!

335
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,235
Would you take your hat off?

336
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,514
Here it's the custom,
when you enter a house.

337
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,991
Stuff and nonsense.
- Pankrac.

338
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,038
They have no baggage.

339
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,233
No luggage?

340
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,959
And what's this?

341
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,793
What is this?

342
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,394
What's this, then?
Well - what is this?

343
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,148
Yes, what is it?

344
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,196
And this?
What is this?

345
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,560
Please excuse him,

346
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,438
he's a fly-killer simpleton,
as the English say.

347
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,319
A more fly-boy.

348
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,277
This way, please.

349
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,911
Ah, his Majesty, in person?

350
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,673
This is my hotel.
The Vulture.

351
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,118
Give them a right royal welcome!

352
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,436
My dear hands and feet,

353
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,868
ďyou know what we're doing?

354
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,879
Lazing about.

355
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,913
That's the life.

356
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,039
Will she be home?

357
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,040
Will there be fish?

358
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,149
Come here!

359
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,111
WELCOME, STRANGERS!

360
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,159
What are they doing?

361
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,230
Going to the station to welcome someone.

362
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,359
Hardly, there's no railroad here.

363
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,954
Wave at them,
maybe it's for us.

364
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,275
Hallo!

365
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,032
King Piccolo asks us

366
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,159
for dinner.

367
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,877
Welcome, strangers,
what have you bright me?

368
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,670
Want one too, huh?

369
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,955
Go burst -

370
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,836
with envy!

371
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,275
And what's this?

372
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,557
A field kitchen.

373
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,517
My gift, for the army.

374
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,991
That'll come in handy.
We wage wars often.

375
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,996
Extricator of shells

376
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,635
fallen into the soup.

377
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,392
Isn't that clever!

378
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,311
Let's show them our printing-house.

379
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,358
Well.

380
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,875
My Minister for Information
will explain

381
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,596
how we do it.

382
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,551
I follow the international situation.

383
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,677
Then we either make cannon-balls

384
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,588
show the gentlemen -

385
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,752
or letters from the cannon-balls.

386
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,796
What are you making now?

387
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,475
Letters from cannon-balls.

388
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,597
The situation is favourable for reading.

389
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,434
The more people read,
the worse they shoot.

390
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,353
Watch out.
How about you?

391
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,749
No gift?

392
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,353
Not for you,

393
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,829
but for your lovely daughter.

394
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,631
For Bosanna?

395
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,951
You sly-fox.
I bet you're after her.

396
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,192
Your Majesty.
I saw her portrait

397
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,350
and now can't wait to see her.

398
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,959
I've had enough,

399
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,871
of these everlasting beatings!

400
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,953
Just you try!

401
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,553
Oh, please -

402
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,996
Do calm down.
What a swash-buckler you are!

403
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,477
Do excuse them,
It's their job.

404
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,719
My ancestors.

405
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,156
My Grandpa,

406
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,356
my Great-Grandpa,
my Great-Aunt,

407
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,356
my Grand-Mother-in-Law,
my Grand-Father-in-Law,

408
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,709
good old stabbed Oldfiich,

409
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,510
pst

410
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,830
my dear deceased wife.

411
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,680
She is lovelier than I expected.

412
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,471
Ah, Mother Nature -
where goest thou for inspiration?

413
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,752
Krucifix!

414
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,070
I'm glad you came.

415
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,353
If you please.

416
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,311
Mr Bimbác has a gift for you.

417
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,189
Let's see what you've brought.

418
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,714
Gold or silver,
precious gems?

419
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,712
Costume jewellery.

420
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,315
We don't have that yet!

421
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,436
You may put it on me.

422
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,472
Men like doing that.

423
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,195
Don't see what they see in it.

424
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,318
Isn't it odd.

425
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,915
The Queen an ugly cow,
the King a silly twirp

426
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,477
and what a lovely daughter.

427
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,192
Surprises me, too.

428
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,635
All three daughters turned out well.

429
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,230
I married Rosanna off
to the King of Picardy,

430
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,795
Hosanna to a banker in Vienna

431
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,398
and Bosanna - we have yet to see.

432
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,472
It would have to be a rich suitor

433
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,232
who'd cough up a pile of gold
for the state coffers.

434
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,796
I'll swap my harp for your pouch.

435
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,633
E e.

436
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,951
Why ďyou have so many flies?

437
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,631
Our spiders are lazy.

438
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,389
Why are you such a poor country?

439
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,550
Our subjects are lazy.

440
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,992
How come you have such lovely tooth?

441
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,199
And your eyes,
they're set so far apart.

442
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,879
And yours are full of fire!

443
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,473
I'm a soldier.

444
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,076
They reflect the fire of battle.

445
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,840
What do you do?

446
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,550
I can cook.

447
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,674
Do you want to know what I can do?

448
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,514
Wait, be quite.

449
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,632
You two are fun.

450
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,878
Well...

451
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,708
Now me.

452
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,236
Bosanna can marry any time,

453
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,313
she's of age.

454
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,119
But her bride-groom

455
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,831
must truly tinkle with gold!

456
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,439
Swap your pouch for my harp.

457
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,636
No.
- What's all this whispering?

458
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,318
Bad manners.

459
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,833
Whisper not, want not.

460
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,352
I'll show you something.

461
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,515
It's bottom-less.
- Money isn't everything.

462
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,356
When I need soldiers -
I have them.

463
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,350
When I need street-sweepers -
here we are.

464
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,832
When I need...

465
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,229
Hairdressers - do make some!

466
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,872
As you wish.

467
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,396
Ó ó hm,

468
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,596
A natty thing, that.

469
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,112
Bosanna, I really don't know
who is the richest.

470
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,996
Whom to give preference
should they want your hand in marriage.

471
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,354
I hereby request...
- I also request...

472
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,389
I like the pouch and the harp.

473
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,629
You are right.
Oh, yes.

474
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,993
Let us drink some wine
my friends

475
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,640
and be the wiser.

476
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,958
Drink it all, my friends,

477
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,953
the truth that wine holds

478
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,076
sits at the bottom!

479
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,438
Why?
Why?

480
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,275
What what?

481
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:19,195
Why plunge a dagger in your mate's back?

482
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,712
With a dagger in your back
you'd better turn onto your belly.

483
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,752
You were a sight

484
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,798
when they brought you back
like two felled sacks.

485
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,829
D'you know what he did to me?

486
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,669
No.

487
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,553
He proposed to her himself.

488
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,471
Would you believe it?

489
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,915
I would.
He can't help it.

490
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,276
But you wanted to marry me off!

491
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,630
That was the agreement.

492
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,470
If he wants to get married,
I'll strum up a similar one for him.

493
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,075
Not a problem.
- One to look just like Bosanna?

494
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,157
Sure.

495
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,710
So. Strum her up, right here!

496
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,955
Here?
- Yeah.

497
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,477
How's that?

498
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,392
Your bill.

499
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,597
With extras like coat-hangars,
water and mirror

500
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,757
it comes to 25 pieces of gold,

501
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,115
including daylight
it totals 30 pieces of gold.

502
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,314
We'll pay when we leave.
Seram!

503
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,437
No,
here bills are paid every morning.

504
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,519
Here, you miser.

505
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,438
Dammit...

506
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,474
Come here!

507
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,115
Here, they're with the camels.

508
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,078
So it wasn't stuff and nonsense!

509
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,831
I'm confiscating the cigarettes,
your clothes,

510
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,357
everything.

511
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,112
The beggarly rabble!

512
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,713
Your baggage too.

513
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,792
They come to a hotel
and can't pay.

514
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,598
Who put this door here?

515
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,035
Never seen such customers!

516
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,199
STRANGERS, GO HOME!

517
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,955
Shame, shame!

518
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,755
Children!
Get your stones ready!

519
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,869
Hallo!
- Stop it!

520
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,518
Can't you read?

521
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,272
Yes, but slowly.
- Mind out!

522
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,873
Throw - throw - throw!

523
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,355
These people are good, and obedient.

524
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,591
They love you and then stone you,
as they're told.

525
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,318
Why isn't it working?

526
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,268
They've nicked your magic stuff

527
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,636
and fixed you up with counterfeits.

528
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,231
Come, help me.

529
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,510
Defend yourselves till I come back.

530
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,558
Yes.
Come on.

531
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,551
Where are they?
Those three?

532
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,150
First floor,
suite no. 1.

533
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,390
Follow me!

534
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,198
Sabres - ready!

535
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,036
Follow me!
Follow him!

536
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,317
Stop!
Sssh!

537
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,199
One, one, one

538
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,471
Here they are.

539
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,955
Open up!

540
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,313
Open up at once!

541
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,630
What a noisy hotel.

542
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,598
Hej rup!

543
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,473
Now we've got you.

544
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,750
Where are they?
Where are they?

545
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,317
Where are you?
Where are you?

546
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,673
Come on, out!

547
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,358
We know, you're there!

548
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,116
Hear that?

549
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,356
Silence!
They've got them.

550
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,158
They'll be right down.

551
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,958
This'll be something.

552
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,473
Make way!

553
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,915
You wave like this,
hit like this.

554
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,191
Get ready to beat them up!

555
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,835
Now!
Not like that.

556
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,273
So pretty and she steals.

557
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,559
Where've you sprung from?

558
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,558
Easy.

559
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,995
Slithered down,

560
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,390
You're no chimney-sweep.

561
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,670
You're one of the foreigners.

562
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,194
I thought you hadn't noticed me.

563
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,031
Hand back my pouch,
so that you wouldn't make me public

564
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,395
that you are a thief family.

565
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,156
Look, I've got a hat

566
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,037
that does my bidding.

567
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,513
I'll give you whatever you wish

568
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,068
and you hand back my pouch.

569
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,991
The hat can give you anything?

570
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,157
Except for give and money.

571
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,592
How about love?
- It can't do that.

572
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,756
I pretended not to see you

573
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,911
because you're the one I like.

574
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,797
You were the only one I liked.

575
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,315
I thought you'd be peevish

576
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,675
at my ignoring you

577
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,430
and come to me.

578
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,434
And you came.

579
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,591
You angelic little bitch.

580
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,955
You little bitch!

581
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,754
Guards!

582
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,758
Arrest him!

583
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,675
Help!

584
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,829
And that's it, chimney-sweep.

585
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,640
String him up on the rack,

586
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,832
give him the Spanish boot,

587
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,956
sit him on an American stove

588
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,799
and throw him to the German rats.

589
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,748
Catch him!
Move it!

590
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,194
What a time.
Hurry up, you slow-coaches.

591
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,160
Hurry up, you slow-coaches.
Climb up!

592
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,829
I ran ever the roof.

593
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,840
Where's my pouch?

594
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,355
And my harp?
- Guys,

595
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,476
We haven't even got the hat!

596
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,913
They must be looking for somebody.

597
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,431
Over there.

598
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,679
Let's go.
- Yeah.

599
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,713
Halt!

600
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,433
Stát!

601
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,592
Stát!

602
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,557
Stop! Not you.

603
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,676
Where are you going?

604
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,597
To fertilize the vinyards.

605
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,639
All right.
On your way.

606
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,470
Got them?
- No.

607
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,511
You've disappointed me.

608
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,550
They are crafty rascals.

609
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,395
They'll got a new hat,
another harp,

610
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,118
and have their revenge.
You bet.

611
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,198
They should get the life sentence,
and we'd have some peace.

612
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,511
Got them?
- No.

613
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,352
Well?
I've got them!

614
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,113
Let me see.

615
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,555
Kindly get it in focus.

616
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,118
Very good.

617
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,555
We'll send the cavalry.
- Yes.

618
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,912
I'll warn the customs official.

619
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,952
Hop!

620
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,793
That scoundrel isn't answering.

621
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,879
Leave me in peace.

622
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,468
When I'm milking, I'm milking.

623
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,952
Oh, let's get out of here!

624
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,798
Over the chasm.
Over the chasm!

625
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,720
You bastard,

626
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,192
lift that receiver!

627
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,517
Stop!

628
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,198
No, let's get out of here!
Gone.

629
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,878
Sshh.

630
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,952
Let's go!

631
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,356
I insist on quiet.

632
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,835
Go home, everybody.

633
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,830
That's all.

634
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,839
What'll you have, sweep?

635
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,948
Coffee with rum.

636
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,197
Got any money?

637
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,556
No.

638
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,639
He's got no money
and wants coffee with rum.

639
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,518
But we're not poor, either.

640
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,513
Valuables.

641
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,434
My mates and I,
we paid for them with blood.

642
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,238
What is it?

643
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,039
Some old medals.

644
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,632
I see.
They won't buy you a crumb.

645
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,752
Valueless.

646
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,389
How's that?
They have a great value.

647
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,117
This is for faithful service,

648
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,039
this for bravery,

649
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,159
this for courage,
this for merits,

650
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,352
and here's the War Cross!

651
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,388
Won't buy you a fart.

652
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,511
I'll sell a painting.

653
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,511
A little one.

654
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,751
For how much?

655
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,638
Soup and bread for three.

656
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,198
Let 'em have it!

657
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,711
Now we're in the soup.

658
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,995
A drop of soup'll be fine.
Lucky, we have got it.

659
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,991
I mean generally speaking.

660
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,036
What do we do now?
- Where do we go?

661
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,119
And the dwarfs?

662
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,957
They helped us once,
they could do so again.

663
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,838
Where do we look for them?
- Under the nose-tree.

664
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,119
Where they always meet.

665
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,473
That's easily said,
but what's that tree like?

666
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:58,315
It's sure to be odd-looking.
A nose-tree?!

667
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,631
Let's go and look for it.
Whoever finds it, calls the others.

668
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,232
Hey, aren't you a nose-tree?

669
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,595
No, a dry apple-tree.

670
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,477
Come here, boys -

671
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,518
I've found it!

672
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,114
I've found the nose-tree!

673
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,917
How did you come by that?
What is it?

674
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,156
The apples brought it on.

675
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,079
There now, it's okay.

676
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,355
Back to what it was.

677
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,149
What a nose!

678
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,079
Look, pears.

679
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:37,875
What is it?

680
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,475
Just look at yourselves!

681
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,356
You look a sight too.

682
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,791
Where are we?
- Guess!

683
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,793
They have lazy spiders
and a King who steals.

684
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,590
Those are the dwarfs.

685
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,153
We know it's you,

686
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,876
disguised as sea-gulls.
- Sshh.

687
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,150
Why are we in this got-up?

688
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,399
I've got it!

689
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,999
They're little, but so clever

690
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,392
Royal Apples!

691
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,956
A specialty for royal families!

692
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,477
Royal Apples!

693
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,471
Royal Apples!

694
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,758
What sort of fruit is this?

695
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,557
Who isn't of royal family,
dies after eating them.

696
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:47,595
But those of royal blood
grow handsome and healthy.

697
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,559
I'll buy them for Bosanna.

698
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,399
She's lovely anyway,
how lovely will she be then!

699
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,916
How much are they?
- Their weight in diamonds.

700
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,992
Dammit all!

701
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:05,229
D'you have a sales licence?
- No.

702
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,839
There's a fine for that.

703
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,399
D'you know how much?
- No.

704
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,629
Double the price!

705
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,350
Twice their weight in diamonds.

706
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,313
Got that?
- No.

707
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,952
We hereby confiscate your apples.

708
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:36,110
Eat up, sweetheart.
They are precious.

709
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,156
I'll come and see you after my bath.

710
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,838
You'll be amazed.

711
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,032
Nurse!
Nurse!

712
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,834
A mirror, quickly!

713
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,033
The old lady had four apples

714
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,554
her old man only two.

715
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,112
What's up?
- Something's up.

716
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,391
Something's always up.
That's how it is.

717
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,799
Or there'd be no history.
- But something unusual.

718
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:08,396
Something's climbing out -
of the Princess's window!

719
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:13,117
If she's even prettier,

720
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,398
it'll be suitors, climbing up in!

721
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,559
Help!
Help!

722
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,275
Oh, my poor child...

723
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,875
That's no suitor,

724
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,916
looks like a snake.

725
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,479
Like what?

726
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,397
Horrors, ol horrors!

727
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,435
Do something with that snake,
I've got to hold my towel.

728
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,353
That's no snake,
it's her nose.

729
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:47,829
Her nose?

730
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,876
For heaven's sake!

731
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,070
For heaven's sake!

732
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,949
Yes yes yes

733
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,559
yes yes yes yeah.

734
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,873
It's at the border.

735
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,793
Ouch!
Ouch!

736
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:14,915
Sorry.

737
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,155
No.
No.

738
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,075
And it's over.
Climbed abroad.

739
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,718
It's just left our country.
- That's a tragedy.

740
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:37,876
An opportunity to proclaim
State mourning.

741
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,708
Shut the window!
She'll catch cold!

742
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:15,033
No,
my nose is out there!

743
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:29,429
It says her nose

744
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,709
taa-ta-taa-ta ta-ta-ta

745
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,071
is making for Vienna.

746
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,955
For the Prater, I bet.

747
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,718
Snuffling for a bit of fun.

748
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,993
Mustn't got onto the big wheel!
Ring up Vienna.

749
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,798
Get off with you!

750
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,993
Hot!

751
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,915
You must be visiting
the thermal springs in Karlovy Vary.

752
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:02,631
You need do no travelling, lovey.
Everything's right under your nose.

753
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,116
Throw!

754
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,550
Don't spit it out, it's healthy.

755
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:28,036
It's the best therapy for everything!

756
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,271
Salt!
Salty!

757
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,238
Then we'll be in Salzburg

758
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,270
Oh Salzburg, Salzburg.

759
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,470
I haven't been to Salzburg.

760
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,439
No.
It's nosing towards Germany.

761
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,071
Jawohl.
And it's there.

762
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,196
Germany calling.
If we don't stop poking our nose

763
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,354
in their affairs,
they're threatening war.

764
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,351
Explain to Germany.
How the things are

765
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,073
I'm having our production changed.

766
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,510
Hello, Germany?
Got this straight:

767
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,549
It's not a beezer,
it's our Princess's nose.

768
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,636
Yes, that long unfortunately.

769
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,316
Back to cannon-balls!

770
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,918
Charge the production line,

771
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,793
no more letters!
Come on!

772
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,956
No, a friendly visit.

773
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,512
Freundschaftsbesuch.

774
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,352
Jawohl.
Me too.

775
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,714
Don't shoot!
It's a friendly visit.

776
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,472
Vorwärz!
Marsch!

777
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,514
Ouch!

778
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,273
Call the doctor.

779
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,396
Can't anybody

780
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,439
stop it growing?

781
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,830
Three physicians from the orient
are here.

782
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,353
Bring them in!

783
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,919
Good morning.

784
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:02,877
We're on the way to Paris,
to Sorbonne University.

785
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,558
We heard your Princess is ailing.

786
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,679
Should you want us to,
we could try -

787
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,918
without guaranty...

788
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,312
to care her terrible sickness.

789
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,913
Of course we want you to.

790
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,116
Look what's grown on her.

791
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,431
After eating apples.

792
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,869
Interesting.

793
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,318
Snakish.

794
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,839
Cabellous.

795
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,388
After eating apples?
- Yes.

796
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,710
We'll try the pear cure.

797
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,956
With Aromatic Rusticana.

798
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,999
What's that?

799
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,113
Horse-radish.

800
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:53,039
Who? Prague?
Prague? I see!

801
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,192
It's pulled back to Prague.

802
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,875
A right snifty place.

803
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,510
It's getting shorter.
That's for sure.

804
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,199
Yes.

805
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,952
Budapest calling.

806
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,470
Hallo, what cheque?

807
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:36,633
From Tesek.
Tudom tudom.

808
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,034
Budapest is calling,
It's broken window displays and

809
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,236
just fled away.
- Glory be.

810
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,909
Ouch...

811
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,350
I can't stand it any longer.

812
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,678
Lazy, lovey, it's getting shorter.

813
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,670
The Castle?
This is the Customs-house.

814
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,390
Somebody's knocking.
- Come in!

815
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,313
Come on, in!

816
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,279
I see,
yeah, yeah

817
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,431
It came to a halt at the border.

818
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,471
What are they doing to it?

819
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,752
Now unpleasant!

820
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:43,352
A customs inspection.

821
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:49,317
There now lovey,
your nose is nearly home,

822
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:52,394
it's like other girls' now.

823
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,552
I don't want the customs inspection.

824
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,394
Stop, Liza.
- Ouch!

825
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,590
Show me that!

826
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:09,229
I recommend another pear
plus Pepper Negrum.

827
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:14,309
Nigrum.
- More!

828
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,039
What is that?

829
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,072
Black pepper.

830
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:26,069
It'll bring about a sneeze

831
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,358
as strong as an earth-quake.

832
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:32,673
A bang like from a cannon.

833
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:09,272
Come on, home!
- Yes, Boss.

834
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,358
This is terrible.
- It is.

835
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,160
Your therapy is successful, Doctors.

836
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,268
But we need it a bit shorter still.

837
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,313
No way, sorry.

838
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,639
We'll pay well!

839
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,990
E e -

840
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:18,469
And you'll get gifts, too.
Look.

841
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,911
E e -

842
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,358
They can do miles and not inches?

843
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,352
We'll see!

844
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,189
To the torture-chamber!

845
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:48,318
Torture can be efficient,
but I'm afraid,

846
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,954
not in this case.

847
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:57,355
What we head here
is no stolen goods around.

848
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,509
I would help a lot.

849
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,476
Stolen goods?
- That's right.

850
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:06,359
With stolen goods things around

851
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:09,000
the medicine doesn't work fully.

852
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,315
You dare maintain

853
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:15,352
that we of noble blood.
Have been stealing?

854
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,111
You sure nicked something.

855
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,712
Take that back1

856
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,633
Why should be?
There are stolen things here.

857
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,273
We stole them ourselves!

858
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,318
Hand them back, Daddy!
Give it back to them, now!

859
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,676
I refuge to live with this trunk!
I won't!

860
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,998
Hand it back -
but to whom?

861
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,356
We'll see it gets to the owners,
we know them well.

862
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,917
I wouldn't advise that.

863
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,473
The things are more important for us

864
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,596
then a couple of inches
of at extra nose.

865
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:48,473
The Princess'll get used to it.

866
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,438
Witches have long noses too.
- On the rack!

867
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:55,355
To the torture-chamber with you,
you horrid old geyser

868
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,233
Catch him,

869
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,589
had string him up on the rack!

870
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,950
Stretch him as a string.

871
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:06,152
You have thrilling adventures ahead!
Stay well.

872
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:14,117
Dear Doctors,
I used to be so pretty.

873
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:18,548
Take those
and help me.

874
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,392
Please.

875
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,193
Thank you.

876
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,475
A couple of daches
and what a difference.

877
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,037
Ah, science is science.

878
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:56,354
Let's go,
or I'll fall in love with her again.

879
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,031
Stop!

880
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:23,154
Where to?
- To the mountains,

881
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,839
we're going trout-fishing.

882
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,310
No, to the right!

883
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,594
I want to laze around.

884
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:35,752
No.
To the left!

885
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:42,469
We'll strum up an army
and capture Monte Alba.

886
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:46,477
Then another Kingdom from the north

887
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,679
and one from the south.

888
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,953
And finally - the whole world.

889
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,837
Still haven't got it out of your system?

890
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,433
Aren't you dumb?

891
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,918
Who has that, has everything.

892
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:04,720
Can command everyone,
forbid everything.

893
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:08,872
Destroy, give orders, kill...

894
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,117
You...

895
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,712
Stop it.

896
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,832
You've come up with this against me?

897
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,354
Your friend?

898
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,433
Against everybody who resists me!

899
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,075
Sabres - out!

900
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,079
The gifts!

901
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:32,838
Come on!
The gifts, I said!

902
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,759
Here!

903
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,516
Did we give you gifts?

904
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,276
Yes, we gave you gifts.

905
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,399
Why did we give you gifts?

906
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,353
We wanted

907
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,635
to make you happy.

908
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,394
Why did we want that?

909
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,479
To be happy
for having made you happy.

910
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,474
But did you make us happy?

911
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,273
No.

912
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,635
You wanted to save the world by force.

913
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,876
You held manoeuvres.

914
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:19,158
You threatened people.
- Threatened your own lives.

915
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:21,356
And we ask you, mates -

916
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:24,313
how many people did you get to smile?

917
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,120
How many children?

918
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,999
We dwarfs are patient.

919
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:37,039
No.
We'll ever be giving you another chance.

920
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:41,916
Trying to teach you mortals again
and again

921
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:45,271
how to handle the magic gifts

922
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,193
We've presented you

923
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,555
with.

924
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:52,828
Maybe you'll come to comprehend
at the million and fifth time.

925
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,399
Or...

926
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,637
The million and sixth time.

927
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:03,509
Got it!

928
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:55,629
Life isn't fun
all the time

929
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:03,989
but some of the time some of the fun
please let be mine!

930
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:12,309
Your empty pocket
worries you

931
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:20,589
but you're well-to-do
as long as you have friends!

932
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,992
To have no gold
is not so bad.

933
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:04,837
To have no heart
is bad indeed.

934
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:10,515
To have problems
is not that bad.

935
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:15,758
To be bored...
that's bad indeed!

936
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,035
Is bad!
Is bad!

937
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:22,073
Life isn't fun
all the time,

938
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:27,996
but some of the time some of the fun
please let be mine!

939
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:32,274
Life isn't fun
all the time,

940
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:37,871
but some of the time some of the fun
please let be mine!

941
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,758
THE END
