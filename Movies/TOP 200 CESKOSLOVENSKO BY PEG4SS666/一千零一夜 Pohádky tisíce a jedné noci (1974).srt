2
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:07,308
I was still young then,
living in my father's house

3
00:01:07,428 --> 00:01:10,004
And having a great time like in paradise

4
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:13,060
But once when the wind blew
the smell of the sea

5
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,555
I couldn't resist my desire
to go far away.

6
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:18,985
I left behind the comforts of home,

7
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:21,532
and went in search of adventure.

8
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:52,891
We were sailing for so many days and
nights that we couldn't count them.

9
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:57,259
But the sea means not only white clouds
and clanging strings.

10
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:00,397
Soon our fate played
a different song for us.

11
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:03,044
All our reserves were used up.

12
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:07,006
And nothing but sea and sea
all around us.

13
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:09,302
In vain were we looking for a shore.

14
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:13,102
And longing to see a piece of land
on the horizon.

15
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,698
All our hopes were lost.

16
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:20,049
We didn't even dare to think
that this could go on.

17
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:29,183
The dark phantom of hunger
was hanging above us

18
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:33,327
Over the immense endless sea
there death was grinning

19
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:37,291
Only fishes could save us
from starving to death.

20
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,338
The sea was full with them.

21
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:41,152
But how to catch them?

22
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:44,930
The last fishhook...the last hope.

23
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:23,006
The evil mark of inevitable fate
reminded us again of the sad end.

24
00:03:23,302 --> 00:03:26,074
We were lying on the ship
overwhelmed by starvation,

25
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:29,843
Watching greedily those beautiful fishes.

26
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:33,019
We were envisioning them on barbecue.

27
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:36,797
But they were swimming too far
from us and couldn't be caught.

28
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:39,648
They may have felt we had no
good intentions toward them.

29
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,986
One night a big fish came to our ship.

30
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:59,956
I collected my last strength
and tried my luck.

31
00:04:08,692 --> 00:04:09,907
Finally...

32
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:11,804
Fate was on my side.

33
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:14,018
But what a wonder!

34
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:16,265
The fish talked

35
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:19,328
It was only whispering
but still, it was talking.

36
00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:22,090
It begged and asked for release

37
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,111
It promised me a reward,
the nicest one the sea can give.

38
00:04:26,376 --> 00:04:30,338
To a hungry poor fellow like me
it offered a huge fortune.

39
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:35,347
No one was watching
and I always was a good guy.

40
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:39,381
It persuaded me after all,
so I let it go.

41
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:45,456
And I did right.

42
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:49,023
The reward was worth it.

43
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,864
Next morning I felt sorry for my deed.

44
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:08,126
But before I could confess
to my hungry mates...

45
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:10,424
Land!

46
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:12,587
Land!

47
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:20,918
Far from us and surrounded by sea
there was a beautiful island

48
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:23,980
We saw a lot of coconut trees

49
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,377
And we believed that we were heading
for a paradise

50
00:05:26,497 --> 00:05:29,424
Which would end our suffering.

51
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:54,518
We had nuts galore

52
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:56,773
But hunger made us so week

53
00:05:56,893 --> 00:06:00,451
That we couldn't break a single one.

54
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:07,484
blood

55
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,715
Blood was gushing from the soil.

56
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:13,210
Nothing but blood...a waterfall of blood.

57
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:17,105
We soon understood

58
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:19,002
This wasn't an island

59
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:21,984
But the back of a huge whale.

60
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:24,148
It had been sleeping there for ages

61
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:26,944
so a palm garden blossomed on it.

62
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:29,607
The strike with the axe woke it up.

63
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:31,654
And it was too bad for us.

64
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:41,791
The sea swallowed our ship
and my friends too.

65
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:44,278
Even I was going down.

66
00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:47,823
I was desperate and saying goodbye
to life already.

67
00:06:47,943 --> 00:06:51,119
But my lucky fate brought me to the fish

68
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:53,315
Which I had set free.

69
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:55,888
It saw me and recognized me.

70
00:06:56,008 --> 00:07:00,464
And my only good deed
redeemed me.

71
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:03,593
Before I could think
it took me on its back

72
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:05,977
and brought me to the surface.

73
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:08,956
It was about time.

74
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:11,552
I badly needed to breath.

75
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:14,315
I couldn't last any longer down there.

76
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:29,612
We were swimming nearly a whole day
and when the sun was setting down

77
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:33,257
We finally reached an unknown shore.

78
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:36,624
It didn't look welcoming but I was glad

79
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,653
to have a firm land beneath my feet.

80
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:42,107
I was crying with joy.

81
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:45,819
No

82
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:50,096
No one will ever make me return
to the sea.

83
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:52,231
Farewell fish

84
00:07:52,896 --> 00:07:54,877
Thank you for your help.

85
00:07:55,177 --> 00:07:58,472
I don't want even to hear about adventure
any more.

86
00:07:58,755 --> 00:07:59,970
I feel good here.

87
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:15,688
This old and wise elephant
had mercy for me.

88
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:18,368
And brought me on his back to the city.

89
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:23,758
Suddenly I sensed the sweetest
smell in the world.

90
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:27,170
The smell of fresh bread.

91
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:18,918
But fate wasn't done with me.

92
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:22,746
That night a thief slipped
into the sultan's palace.

93
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:26,180
He stole all the sultan's treasures
down to the last coin.

94
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,940
And no clue was left of where
gold, jewels, and thief were gone.

95
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:50,066
When the sun
rose in the sky the next day

96
00:11:50,186 --> 00:11:52,280
I was still sleeping peacefully

97
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:54,111
But not for long.

98
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,505
The steps of the sultan's guard
were rumbling around me.

99
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:15,625
I couldn't understand what was going on.

100
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:17,979
Why were they coming around me?

101
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:19,943
Why are they watching me?

102
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:21,657
What do they want?

103
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:23,838
I didn't do anything.

104
00:12:31,742 --> 00:12:35,387
I was bounded like a criminal
and was led to the sultan.

105
00:12:40,348 --> 00:12:42,762
The sultan was angry and snarling

106
00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:46,758
and trying to force me to admit that
I had stolen his treasure last night.

107
00:12:46,878 --> 00:12:48,839
His jewels and pearls

108
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:52,834
I was trembling for my life.

109
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:55,880
I couldn't understand
why was I being treated like this

110
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,853
Then I saw the baker and he said...

111
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:03,618
It's him

112
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:06,231
The thief

113
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:09,037
Yesterday he gave me pearls for
a loaf of common bread.

114
00:13:09,157 --> 00:13:10,668
So he is the thief.

115
00:13:11,717 --> 00:13:14,380
Yesterday he gave me those stolen pearls,

116
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:16,876
The baker didn't stop yelling.

117
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:22,390
But the wise sultan thought it over.

118
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:26,651
How come the baker got
the pearls yesterday

119
00:13:26,913 --> 00:13:30,142
while the theft occurred last night?

120
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:32,572
There's something wrong here.

121
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:35,684
So he made the princess come and asked

122
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:38,148
if this is her pearl necklace.

123
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:45,252
The Princess was watching it
for a long time and then said:

124
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:49,213
Release that innocent man,
these aren't my pearls.

125
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:53,020
I have never had such a nice necklace.

126
00:13:57,347 --> 00:13:59,394
I was saved.

127
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,854
Then the sultan invited me to his court

128
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:08,003
And there was so much food and drink
that it made the table bow down.

129
00:14:08,123 --> 00:14:11,482
Since then I have abundance of everything.

130
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:15,416
Also the baker was satisfied.

131
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:19,294
He had become the main provider of bread.

132
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:24,156
The princess kept the nice pearls.

133
00:14:24,276 --> 00:14:28,367
So we all were happy and content.

134
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:46,539
Then in the golden age
of princesses and roses

135
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:50,134
I was living by sultan Muhammad

136
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:52,697
He was a passionate hunter.

137
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:56,705
Whenever he went hunting
I had to accompany him

138
00:15:57,047 --> 00:16:01,707
For a poor sailor like me
it was a great honor.

139
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:06,717
He liked me so much that he never
did a step without me.

140
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:13,289
Pity that he was so heavy.

141
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:15,336
He made my back ache.

142
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:18,024
But I didn't complain a bit.

143
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,983
At least not aloud

144
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:27,527
So much I appreciated
the friendship of a powerful sultan.

145
00:16:28,282 --> 00:16:31,777
And there was another bound to keep me
in the sultan' palace.

146
00:16:32,476 --> 00:16:34,673
The strongest one.

147
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:36,637
The princess.

148
00:16:37,086 --> 00:16:38,933
The sultan's daughter

149
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,345
She didn't know I loved her

150
00:16:41,662 --> 00:16:43,925
It was my secret.

151
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:09,762
Hold tight, no worry,
just come in...in...in.

152
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:14,697
Stand up, there's a guest for you.
Stand up.

153
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:21,826
Hold tight...tight...tight.

154
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,528
Let him be...let him be!
Scoundrels!

155
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:35,494
I'll show you.
Let him be, let him be!

156
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:13,610
Let's go, let's go.

157
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:36,638
Good old parrot - my only real friend
in the sultan's court - saved me.

158
00:19:37,054 --> 00:19:38,885
He lacked neither heart nor guts.

159
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:41,173
Attention!

160
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:43,287
Turn around.

161
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:46,101
March now!

162
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:50,977
Come on! Come on!

163
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:18,192
Come on!

164
00:20:29,514 --> 00:20:32,892
When the alarm rang
I was far on the sea.

165
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:36,983
Far from sleepy princess,
far from fat sultan.

166
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:39,584
I was going away
saying to myself

167
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:43,246
I would let nobody
ride on my back ever again.

168
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,878
I sculled all night long to get myself
as far as possible from the sultan.

169
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:55,183
I knew he wouldn't forgive me
and would hunt me down.

170
00:20:56,997 --> 00:21:01,724
By sundown I glimpsed a little island
not far from me.

171
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:05,747
There was a funny rock
in the middle of it

172
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:08,127
resembling a huge egg.

173
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,188
Is there a bird capable of
laying eggs so huge?

174
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:16,450
But it isn't a rock either.

175
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:21,058
What could this be
for lord's sake?

176
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:54,898
The sultan's soldiers!

177
00:21:55,018 --> 00:21:57,328
What should I do know?
How could I escape?

178
00:21:57,448 --> 00:22:01,990
The sultan is holding me already.
Now he will show me.

179
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,937
This is my end.

180
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:21,803
It was an enormous horrible bird.

181
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:27,396
Without the slightest sound I took cover
under its wings like a timid mouse.

182
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:34,952
When I saw its appetite

183
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,272
I crawled into the darkest place
beneath its vans.

184
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:43,566
When the night came I stayed
buried in its feathers.

185
00:22:43,882 --> 00:22:47,111
But I couldn't sleep a bit
because of fear.

186
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:51,417
Not before the morning
was I able to sleep a bit.

187
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,998
Only for a while.

188
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:55,911
But I wouldn't wish anybody
to awake like this.

189
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,122
The height made me dizzy.

190
00:23:15,984 --> 00:23:17,549
We flew the whole day

191
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:20,511
And I had to be careful so the beast
doesn't notice...

192
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:22,908
There was an illegal passenger.

193
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:25,955
It would be bad for me.

194
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:06,156
I saw with my own eyes...

195
00:24:06,276 --> 00:24:09,568
the terrible creature catch an elephant.

196
00:24:12,258 --> 00:24:14,063
Good that it flew away.

197
00:24:14,562 --> 00:24:16,426
But what about me now?

198
00:24:16,842 --> 00:24:19,056
I stayed on my own

199
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:21,080
And I wondered ...

200
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,934
What will I do alone?

201
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:28,009
This unknown forest frightened me.

202
00:25:58,613 --> 00:26:01,742
I realized that this poor old man
couldn't walk.

203
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:04,137
And wanted me to carry him.

204
00:26:04,257 --> 00:26:07,050
He will surely show me the way
to good people.

205
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,096
So I had mercy on him.

206
00:26:10,878 --> 00:26:12,792
But what a bad idea!

207
00:26:12,912 --> 00:26:16,296
The oldster clung on to my back
kicking me like mad

208
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:18,543
hitting me like a horse

209
00:26:18,663 --> 00:26:21,206
And I just couldn't get rid of him.

210
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:24,037
Is my back only for burdens?

211
00:26:24,157 --> 00:26:27,299
Am I a pony or a donkey?

212
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,069
I must get rid of him whatever it takes.

213
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:18,192
But even hippo's stomach wasn't strong
enough for this bully.

214
00:27:30,334 --> 00:27:33,837
I was plodding with the codger
hungry and thirsty all day long.

215
00:27:33,957 --> 00:27:37,117
I would give half of
my life for a gulp.

216
00:27:37,237 --> 00:27:40,296
Now! look what luck gave me!

217
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,829
There was a cask in front of me.
Nice cask!

218
00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:46,310
Castaways must have forgotten it here.

219
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,122
Finally a drink.
The thirst was killing me.

220
00:27:49,456 --> 00:27:53,126
But I didn't get one gulp...
The codger was thirsty too.

221
00:27:53,246 --> 00:27:58,013
And how thirsty!
Like he had no bottom, no limits.

222
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:01,243
And not a drop was left for me.

223
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,904
It was wine

224
00:28:06,024 --> 00:28:08,134
Luckily for me!

225
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:11,496
Even bad things bring good sometimes.

226
00:28:11,616 --> 00:28:16,200
The oldster cheered up, forgot to hold on
and tumbled down.

227
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,577
He forgot about me and went on
fooling around like a comedian.

228
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:26,186
He got wiped out by the wine

229
00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:28,449
And I felt good.

230
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:31,079
As if I got rid of the weight
of a mountain

231
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:51,646
My lucky star hadn't left me yet.

232
00:28:52,562 --> 00:28:55,391
Castaways accepted me like one of them

233
00:28:55,511 --> 00:29:00,081
And we set for the sea
towards new adventures.

234
00:29:22,947 --> 00:29:26,700
I always longed for adventures but
in the end I learnt

235
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,949
That happiness is as fickle
as a butterfly

236
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:34,359
Only sea has never let me down.

237
00:29:34,743 --> 00:29:38,338
It lead me to
the greatest adventures of my life.

238
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:41,883
The sea was always my faithful friend.

239
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:44,263
My faithful mate.

240
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:05,034
When the sky cleared up we
sailed to a large rocky island.

241
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,680
We hoped it wasn't a wasteland.

242
00:31:08,373 --> 00:31:11,918
We needed some help and went
in search of good people.

243
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:12,905
It was a terrible discovery.

244
00:32:13,188 --> 00:32:15,868
We had been caught
by a human eating giant.

245
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,680
Alas! What a destiny!

246
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,410
We had to escape whatever it takes
otherwise we would serve as his dinner.

247
00:33:25,276 --> 00:33:27,689
Lucky for us that he couldn't see us.

248
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:29,586
He begun to destroy all the castle

249
00:33:29,706 --> 00:33:32,482
He wanted to kill us, destroy us

250
00:33:32,602 --> 00:33:34,215
Smash us apart

251
00:33:34,335 --> 00:33:37,481
He wanted his revenge
and he nearly succeeded

252
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:42,191
It was a close call.

253
00:34:42,694 --> 00:34:46,222
We managed to sail away just
out the giant's reach.

254
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,834
But then he heard
the splash of our paddles...

255
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:51,741
He could tell our position

256
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:53,772
And it was the end for us.

257
00:35:28,855 --> 00:35:32,717
Nobody but I survived all that horror.

258
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:36,611
Here I was again sailing like a poor
castaway

259
00:35:36,731 --> 00:35:38,901
In an old cramped cask.

260
00:35:40,082 --> 00:35:41,963
It was my ship now.

261
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:45,241
My last rickety hope

262
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:54,140
I was sailing hungry and thirsty
through all those days and nights.

263
00:35:54,506 --> 00:35:56,803
I was saying goodbye to life already.

264
00:35:56,923 --> 00:35:59,299
I felt my death coming

265
00:35:59,419 --> 00:36:04,504
So I felt asleep weak and desolate.

266
00:36:13,194 --> 00:36:16,972
The sea didn't let me down.

267
00:36:17,754 --> 00:36:19,918
It helped me as usual.

268
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:25,940
During my big sleep
seahorses pulled me to a little bay.

269
00:36:27,438 --> 00:36:31,439
And I was sleeping and sleeping

270
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,772
After waking up
I couldn't believe my eyes

271
00:36:37,892 --> 00:36:41,984
Instead of endless sea
I saw a marvelous garden.

272
00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:52,537
I have never seen
so much beauty put together.

273
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:56,748
I was stupefied by the scent of flowers
and sweet music.

274
00:36:57,147 --> 00:37:00,249
I begun to think I had come
into the world beyond.

275
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:02,148
Into paradise.

276
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:26,516
It was a paradise for real

277
00:37:26,782 --> 00:37:28,280
But a forbidden one.

278
00:37:29,062 --> 00:37:31,292
Probably paradise of some sultan.

279
00:37:31,908 --> 00:37:34,621
I would have hard time
if caught.

280
00:37:34,897 --> 00:37:36,928
I mustn't show up

281
00:37:42,403 --> 00:37:44,118
Now this was too much.

282
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:45,998
I couldn't watch this.

283
00:37:46,118 --> 00:37:50,055
I was starving to death...and here...
such beautiful apples

284
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:52,019
I must have at least one

285
00:37:52,352 --> 00:37:55,331
even if they cut me up.

286
00:39:05,758 --> 00:39:09,836
Now I had here a sultan's dancer
instead of the apple!

287
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:11,659
What a mess!

288
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,354
Could I let her go?

289
00:39:15,474 --> 00:39:17,734
She would reveal my presence.

290
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:33,965
But then the little dancer
started to like me.

291
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:38,143
However I had a huge fear of the sultan.

292
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:53,068
The little dancer recognized
the sultan's ring.

293
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:55,747
He must have lost it during his bath.

294
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:58,395
She explained to me that this ring
has an evil power.

295
00:39:58,515 --> 00:40:02,240
A man pointed at with a finger
wearing the ring looses his head.

296
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,694
The power of the cruel sultan
was built upon this.

297
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,925
And now we own the ring.

298
00:40:08,045 --> 00:40:11,220
We needn't to worry and hide anymore.

299
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:22,744
She was dancing with joy so long
that we were found.

300
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:25,052
It was the end.

301
00:40:25,468 --> 00:40:28,398
I was so scared that
I completely forgot the ring.

302
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,134
I was dragged right
in front of the sultan...

303
00:40:52,254 --> 00:40:55,080
Who was sitting on the throne
with a hand in plaster...

304
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,507
So the suitors wouldn't see...

305
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,769
He had lost his evil power.

306
00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:25,918
In the last moment I recalled...

307
00:41:26,038 --> 00:41:29,612
The ring's magic power
and gave it a try.

308
00:41:53,374 --> 00:41:57,152
Then I was elected to be
the governor of the whole country

309
00:41:57,968 --> 00:41:59,932
I gave my first command.

310
00:42:02,426 --> 00:42:07,302
I ordered a huge banquet
of the most delicious dishes

311
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,719
So I, a hungry sailor,
only on the throne could eat my fill

312
00:42:21,511 --> 00:42:24,383
Then I gave my second and last order

313
00:42:25,106 --> 00:42:28,685
I wanted a new ship for a long sailing.

314
00:42:28,805 --> 00:42:33,788
Why, I wouldn't sit on the throne when
the sails could bring me wherever I like

315
00:42:36,862 --> 00:42:41,506
When the ship was finished I said
goodbye to the city and the people

316
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:45,517
Let them rule themselves
without the magic ring

317
00:42:45,637 --> 00:42:50,671
For a last time I waved goodbye to
the dancer who wouldn't leave her home.

318
00:42:54,877 --> 00:42:58,705
On the wide open sea
I threw the ring into the water

319
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:02,084
No one would find it there
and that was good.

320
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,923
Now I was happy...

321
00:43:04,656 --> 00:43:07,385
having a nice new ship

322
00:43:08,155 --> 00:43:10,774
and sailing for another adventure.

323
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:36,692
My native land...

324
00:43:37,142 --> 00:43:39,621
That meant music
and singing of nightingales.

325
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:41,868
as well as the scent of juicy meadows

326
00:43:41,988 --> 00:43:44,082
and charming flowers

327
00:43:45,163 --> 00:43:47,893
I believed I wouldn't find
more delightful place in the world

328
00:43:48,013 --> 00:43:50,323
than this one.

329
00:43:50,807 --> 00:43:54,785
Nonetheless all that beauty didn't beat

330
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:56,989
My desire for sea.

331
00:43:57,306 --> 00:44:00,967
The sea, it was my greatest love.

332
00:44:29,347 --> 00:44:30,778
We were astonished

333
00:44:30,898 --> 00:44:33,491
Our ship was going through waves like mad

334
00:44:33,611 --> 00:44:37,269
rushing forth pulled by the force of
a magnet mountain.

335
00:44:37,545 --> 00:44:40,408
When we understood
it was too late

336
00:44:40,528 --> 00:44:42,854
We weren't the only ones whose destiny

337
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:45,933
was to be smashed
by the horrible island's shore.

338
00:44:46,053 --> 00:44:49,473
And the magnet mountain had
never spared a castaway.

339
00:45:12,438 --> 00:45:15,600
With determined effort
we fought the mountain

340
00:45:15,966 --> 00:45:19,411
Soon we saw it was a pointless battle.

341
00:45:19,688 --> 00:45:23,316
We threw out the anchor
in a last hopeless attempt.

342
00:45:23,436 --> 00:45:24,531
Maybe...

343
00:45:24,651 --> 00:45:28,942
The sea will have mercy
for the faithful sailor Sinbad

344
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:30,420
Really!

345
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,517
A huge old turtle

346
00:45:32,637 --> 00:45:35,130
The strongest creature in the sea...

347
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:39,341
Dragged our ship out of reach of
the lethal power of the mountain.

348
00:45:39,461 --> 00:45:41,681
And we were saved.

349
00:45:56,722 --> 00:46:00,500
Once out of harm's way I realized
it was no miracle

350
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,664
but a display of friendship

351
00:46:02,784 --> 00:46:05,956
Oh what would an old sailor
do without friends?

352
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:09,962
Dear good turtle,
we will never forget.

353
00:46:12,512 --> 00:46:14,393
We raised the sails again

354
00:46:14,513 --> 00:46:16,890
and set them to friendly winds.

355
00:46:18,082 --> 00:46:21,294
A few days later the sea brought us
to another island

356
00:46:22,093 --> 00:46:24,223
None of us knew this mountain.

357
00:46:24,343 --> 00:46:26,190
And it was a funny mountain.

358
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:29,319
The air full of sounds
of bugles and drums

359
00:46:29,439 --> 00:46:33,080
Swords and spears everywhere
like in an upset wasp nest

360
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,422
I felt that we should avoid this place.

361
00:46:36,688 --> 00:46:38,918
But my curiosity was stronger.

362
00:46:39,038 --> 00:46:42,065
I ordered to anchor at a safe distance.

363
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:56,298
An old sultan ruled over the island

364
00:46:56,418 --> 00:46:59,351
He was then angry with the whole world.

365
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:01,182
His daughter had disappeared

366
00:47:01,302 --> 00:47:02,563
had got lost...

367
00:47:02,683 --> 00:47:06,018
Had been kidnapped
or escaped with someone

368
00:47:06,138 --> 00:47:09,547
For there's no anchor that could
hold a girl's heart...

369
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:11,619
when it's affected by love.

370
00:47:11,739 --> 00:47:14,591
But it wasn't what sultan wanted to hear

371
00:47:14,711 --> 00:47:18,569
He had ordered to catch her,
bring her, and punish her

372
00:47:18,689 --> 00:47:23,309
So all the guardians and soldiers were
hunting for fugitives

373
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:25,546
in every which place

374
00:47:28,734 --> 00:47:34,900
The sultan was so furious that he went
searching for the daring kidnapper himself

375
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,280
He had chosen the most competent
helper in the palace

376
00:47:38,646 --> 00:47:42,890
and the skillful tracker didn't
hesitate to answer the call of duty

377
00:47:55,474 --> 00:48:00,101
But the pursuers couldn't get a glimpse
of this mysterious stranger

378
00:48:00,783 --> 00:48:04,112
What was this old pilgrim
looking for here?

379
00:48:04,378 --> 00:48:06,226
Why is he hiding.

380
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,788
The sultan not having trust in anybody
except his four-legged snooper

381
00:48:11,908 --> 00:48:14,802
was walking and searching,
searching and walking...

382
00:48:14,922 --> 00:48:18,172
from sunset till sundown
through the whole island

383
00:48:18,292 --> 00:48:20,124
They didn't skip anything

384
00:48:20,244 --> 00:48:23,596
There was no single house or court
they didn't search

385
00:48:23,716 --> 00:48:27,507
The crafty couple couldn't
disappear just like that

386
00:48:27,627 --> 00:48:29,929
They searched each hole and slit

387
00:48:30,049 --> 00:48:34,306
They searched also places
nobody else would.

388
00:50:00,277 --> 00:50:04,022
When the night came and the dark
shrouded the miserable island

389
00:50:04,142 --> 00:50:06,252
at our galion

390
00:50:06,372 --> 00:50:09,148
There the mysterious stranger appeared

391
00:50:09,268 --> 00:50:11,961
I was curious and a bit scared

392
00:50:12,081 --> 00:50:16,505
For I didn't like at all
the events on the island

393
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:20,654
This funny old man wanted to buy my ship

394
00:50:21,037 --> 00:50:23,475
The whole ship!
-No way

395
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:26,238
I won't sell my vessel for nothing

396
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:28,876
Not even for a bag of gold coins

397
00:50:28,996 --> 00:50:32,513
but this wasn't an ordinary bag

398
00:50:32,813 --> 00:50:37,040
It would throw out gold coins
with a secret sign

399
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,465
A waterfall of gold,
an endless goldmine

400
00:50:42,412 --> 00:50:46,290
And only by another sign
the gold steam stopped

401
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:49,352
I couldn't resist this

402
00:50:49,472 --> 00:50:53,935
And I traded the old ship for
the magic bag

403
00:50:54,235 --> 00:50:58,312
You may encounter an opportunity
like that only once in a century

404
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:06,548
This was the only missing item!

405
00:51:06,668 --> 00:51:10,892
The sultan's daughter
and her kidnapper himself

406
00:51:11,012 --> 00:51:14,244
They were running away on my ship

407
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:19,104
And I stayed on a poor bark
in the angry sultan's empire

408
00:51:19,224 --> 00:51:23,798
The only thing to give me some courage
was the magic bag

409
00:51:24,205 --> 00:51:28,483
I hoped I wouldn't be lost even there
with all those gold coins.

410
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:39,420
I payed to my devoted mates...

411
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:44,266
From now on everyone
would have to be on his own.

412
00:51:55,162 --> 00:51:57,904
I was led to the sultan like a criminal.

413
00:51:58,822 --> 00:52:02,099
To save myself
I offered him the gold

414
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:07,329
It was wrong to think
that a few coins would appease him

415
00:53:44,473 --> 00:53:46,743
While the sultan was rejoicing in my gold

416
00:53:46,863 --> 00:53:49,717
I managed to hide on the island

417
00:53:49,837 --> 00:53:54,027
Oh, how much I longed for my old ship

418
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:59,119
But it was carrying away the mysterious
stranger and the pretty princess

419
00:54:05,587 --> 00:54:09,066
The next day I was woken up
by a gold rain

420
00:54:09,186 --> 00:54:11,015
I understood at once

421
00:54:11,135 --> 00:54:13,651
They can't stop the magic bag

422
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,684
But they're happy

423
00:54:15,804 --> 00:54:18,341
They are all rich now

424
00:54:22,203 --> 00:54:25,834
But the golden flood brought
happiness to nobody

425
00:54:25,954 --> 00:54:28,129
not even to the sultan

426
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:40,984
The gold rush seized all
the people on the island

427
00:54:41,104 --> 00:54:43,404
And everyone wanted everything

428
00:54:43,524 --> 00:54:47,094
The more gold there was
the more they wanted

429
00:54:47,214 --> 00:54:49,643
And the gold was growing
so the mountain was covered

430
00:54:49,763 --> 00:54:51,593
with glittering metal

431
00:54:51,713 --> 00:54:55,382
The shining gold became
the brightest lighthouse on the sea

432
00:54:55,502 --> 00:54:58,223
It attracted the pirates
from the whole world

433
00:54:58,343 --> 00:55:02,876
They were coming from far away
for the appealing power of gold...

434
00:55:02,996 --> 00:55:06,649
was stronger still than the one
of the magnet mountain

435
00:55:06,769 --> 00:55:12,719
as well as the magnet mountain
the gold one meant disaster and perdition

436
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:17,505
Everyone coming by it became
addicted to the gold rush

437
00:55:17,758 --> 00:55:21,674
This terrible disease seized
the whole island

438
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:46,600
What was the matter with people?

439
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,157
I asked myself unable to believe
my own eyes

440
00:55:50,985 --> 00:55:52,589
And the gold stream...

441
00:55:52,709 --> 00:55:57,452
rolling through the island like a lava
on a vulcano wouldn't stop.

442
00:55:57,572 --> 00:56:01,883
What more would I have witnessed...

443
00:56:02,003 --> 00:56:07,836
If the ever growing mountain didn't
suddenly start to go down to the sea

444
00:56:08,273 --> 00:56:11,213
For the land didn't bear
the weight of all the gold

445
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:14,726
So the island disappeared in the waves

446
00:56:15,028 --> 00:56:18,188
The terrible doom was inevitable

447
00:56:27,549 --> 00:56:29,970
When the sea quieted down again

448
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:33,951
Only birds and swimming quadrupeds
remained in the place

449
00:56:34,071 --> 00:56:37,800
where the proud island had been
towering to the sky

450
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,600
Among the castaways there I came up

451
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,247
Maybe only because I did not wear
a money belt filled with gold

452
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:49,550
I was swimming like no other
sailor had been before

453
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:53,298
And I was wondering apprehensively

454
00:56:53,418 --> 00:56:56,554
Where my live galleon would bring me

455
00:56:57,629 --> 00:57:01,663
After many hard and long days
and longer still nights

456
00:57:02,432 --> 00:57:05,171
My high bred steed and I reached

457
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:07,969
an island and we were saved

458
00:57:25,656 --> 00:57:29,252
There I was alone again
with my desire for unknown

459
00:57:29,372 --> 00:57:31,767
accompanied only
by the caws of seagulls

460
00:57:31,887 --> 00:57:36,558
But their call didn't lure me
back to the deep sea this time.

461
00:57:37,062 --> 00:57:41,810
I had my fill of the sea already
and was grateful to be on dry land.

462
00:57:50,713 --> 00:57:52,344
What a surprise!

463
00:57:52,464 --> 00:57:54,882
A city in the middle of a jungle

464
00:57:55,002 --> 00:57:58,532
The gate was wide opened
so I didn't hesitate

465
00:58:04,261 --> 00:58:09,438
I was astonished to see men running
from me as from the plague

466
00:58:09,558 --> 00:58:11,018
Then I understood

467
00:58:11,138 --> 00:58:14,060
My pony was the cause of their dismay

468
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:17,061
They had never seen
a horse on this island...

469
00:58:17,181 --> 00:58:20,385
And may have taken it
for some bloodthirsty beast

470
00:58:34,785 --> 00:58:39,357
Even the master of the island himself
recoiled from my four-legged mate...

471
00:58:39,477 --> 00:58:43,186
And ordered to his human team
to haste away

472
00:58:50,852 --> 00:58:55,621
The fearful sultan sent for the
heavy artillery to chase away the aliens

473
00:58:58,361 --> 00:59:00,882
I didn't even think of running away...

474
00:59:01,002 --> 00:59:05,164
realizing that my good pony was
the cause of this misunderstanding

475
00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:17,461
I stepped in front of the sultan to explain

476
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:21,297
I gave him my respects as everyone
coming in peace...

477
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:23,414
and wanting no harm

478
00:59:25,297 --> 00:59:28,339
The pacified sultan send away the artillery...

479
00:59:28,459 --> 00:59:30,457
and wanted to please us.

480
00:59:30,577 --> 00:59:35,297
He gave to my pony
the most exquisite delicacies possible...

481
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:37,482
as a peace offering.

482
00:59:40,429 --> 00:59:46,026
It wasn't so easy to persuade him
that horses don't live on meat

483
00:59:46,146 --> 00:59:49,219
and carry patiently men on their back...

484
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:51,562
so they needn't to go on foot.

485
00:59:51,682 --> 00:59:55,436
The sultan was more and more
delighted by my horse

486
00:59:55,556 --> 01:00:00,524
Suddenly he offered the greatest treasure
for the horse

487
01:00:01,834 --> 01:00:02,977
Yes!

488
01:00:03,097 --> 01:00:07,095
The really magic carpet
I had heard so much about

489
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:10,609
First I believed it was a jest

490
01:00:10,729 --> 01:00:13,752
But the sultan really wanted to trade...

491
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:17,719
For he was just too heavy
for the little carpet

492
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:21,699
But I lifted off with it like a bird

493
01:00:45,912 --> 01:00:49,786
"The horse! Bring the horse!"
as if I heard the sultan

494
01:00:50,155 --> 01:00:53,381
Luckily I didn't see what was next

495
01:00:54,406 --> 01:00:57,040
I would have felt for the poor horse.

496
01:01:25,198 --> 01:01:28,896
I didn't need to envied birds
their freedom now.

497
01:01:29,316 --> 01:01:32,089
I myself had wings
and all the world below

498
01:01:32,348 --> 01:01:37,065
Let the carpet bring me where
it likes to and if there's an adventure

499
01:01:37,222 --> 01:01:39,003
I will pass it

500
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:40,999
The days took turns with the nights

501
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,546
And I woke up there like in a cradle

502
01:01:46,618 --> 01:01:51,408
One day the carpet brought me to
the shores of some unknown country.

503
01:01:51,528 --> 01:01:55,425
And soon above towers and roofs
of a nice city.

504
01:01:56,014 --> 01:01:58,972
I had never seen
so marvelous palaces before.

505
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:02,106
As if attracted by the fabulous beauty

506
01:02:02,226 --> 01:02:04,706
I decided to visit the city

507
01:02:05,435 --> 01:02:09,536
I started to look for
a proper place to land

508
01:02:22,053 --> 01:02:25,381
No! This wasn't a friendly welcoming

509
01:02:25,931 --> 01:02:28,331
I won't let my carpet get ruined.

510
01:02:28,451 --> 01:02:30,894
Nor will I be discouraged.

511
01:02:31,201 --> 01:02:35,955
Other means than force were needed
in this proud city.

512
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:40,881
I flew away
to think it all over in peace.

513
01:02:58,978 --> 01:03:02,155
While the guards were still
trying to find me above,

514
01:03:02,275 --> 01:03:04,844
I slipped through right under them.

515
01:03:05,296 --> 01:03:07,582
I didn't arouse the slightest suspicion

516
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:26,963
A piece of luck...

517
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:30,912
the friend of the courageous
was on my side

518
01:03:31,032 --> 01:03:34,064
The streets were then full
with people watching...

519
01:03:34,184 --> 01:03:38,032
the noble procession of an Indian prince
who came for wooing

520
01:03:38,637 --> 01:03:40,855
But what a funny wooing!

521
01:04:00,759 --> 01:04:04,306
I heard that the sultan's daughter...

522
01:04:04,426 --> 01:04:07,751
was bewitched by an unknown spell

523
01:04:07,871 --> 01:04:11,243
Each night when all fell asleep,
she disappeared from her room

524
01:04:11,363 --> 01:04:14,151
and no one knew what
happened to her then.

525
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:19,277
The people felt sorry for the sad girl
living locked up in the highest tower,

526
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:22,270
watched by armed guards,

527
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:23,951
but in vain.

528
01:04:24,463 --> 01:04:28,110
So the sultan had declared that
she would be the wife of the one

529
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:31,885
who would save her from all that magic.

530
01:04:32,005 --> 01:04:38,003
This night too, the princess was
sleeping behind bars and 10 locks.

531
01:04:38,123 --> 01:04:43,446
Even the Indian prince was on watch
with a specially trained falcon

532
01:05:18,978 --> 01:05:22,340
Now! The mystery begins!

533
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:26,709
Princess changes into a dove
to slip through the bars.

534
01:05:27,331 --> 01:05:29,079
But where is she heading?

535
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:31,381
What will happen next?

536
01:05:31,501 --> 01:05:34,579
I decided that I would solve this.

537
01:06:32,139 --> 01:06:35,399
I tried in vain to find
the dove after the flight

538
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:38,794
She disappeared in the deep night

539
01:06:38,914 --> 01:06:42,391
Only in the morning, when the last
shreds of dark dissolved...

540
01:06:42,511 --> 01:06:44,822
did I find her again,

541
01:06:44,942 --> 01:06:46,671
and understood everything.

542
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,763
It was love what had given her wings

543
01:06:49,883 --> 01:06:53,489
and brought her as a dove
to her beloved.

544
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:33,305
I never hesitated

545
01:07:33,977 --> 01:07:37,221
They escaped at the last moment.

546
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:39,809
I had no regrets.

547
01:07:40,086 --> 01:07:43,430
Let the magic carpet serve them
and bring them to a place...

548
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:46,365
Where they wouldn't need
to hide their love.

549
01:07:52,096 --> 01:07:54,533
Now I had only a boat again

550
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:57,492
And it wasn't bad anyway

551
01:07:57,612 --> 01:08:00,988
Even the birds above were happy with
the good ending...

552
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:04,265
In which a faithful love won

553
01:08:04,385 --> 01:08:08,995
And a sailor came back to
where he belonged.

554
01:08:17,861 --> 01:08:22,264
I liked the peace on the
wide open sea at sunset.

555
01:08:23,339 --> 01:08:26,163
I played lullabies then

556
01:08:26,283 --> 01:08:30,180
Calling sleep for me
as well as for the waves

557
01:09:04,268 --> 01:09:05,176
Really?!

558
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:07,478
The sea sultan

559
01:09:07,598 --> 01:09:09,293
The master of all seas

560
01:09:09,413 --> 01:09:13,302
Almighty lord of all castaways' fates

561
01:09:13,773 --> 01:09:15,655
Why was I invited?

562
01:09:15,775 --> 01:09:18,627
Had I perhaps made him mad with my lute?

563
01:09:19,047 --> 01:09:23,131
I had sung so many songs
without any consequences.

564
01:09:23,251 --> 01:09:28,296
Why am I now here in the depth
of the underwater sultan's empire?

565
01:09:29,221 --> 01:09:32,414
I soon had the answers

566
01:09:32,534 --> 01:09:34,199
Play a lullaby,

567
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:37,384
Right away!I want to sleep,
he ordered me.

568
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,098
There was no other choice.

569
01:09:41,361 --> 01:09:45,227
So I was playing for
the sultan and his daughter

570
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,904
What a fate?

571
01:10:08,024 --> 01:10:13,064
The lute always my savior before
will be my perdition now

572
01:10:13,452 --> 01:10:16,712
I'm not a fish, I can't breath
under the water

573
01:10:16,832 --> 01:10:18,292
I was suffocating

574
01:10:18,412 --> 01:10:21,686
It really was time to do something.

575
01:10:50,415 --> 01:10:53,675
While I was escaping
from the sultan's watery empire

576
01:10:53,795 --> 01:10:56,431
a cruel battle was finishing
at the surface

577
01:10:56,551 --> 01:10:59,768
The blood-colored sea was rocking
one last ship

578
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:05,876
Which I found the most beautiful one
in the world when I could breath again

579
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:10,044
I didn't find a living soul
in the whole wreck.

580
01:11:10,751 --> 01:11:11,944
I was alone.

581
01:11:18,045 --> 01:11:20,852
Next day when I said hello
to the sun again,

582
01:11:20,972 --> 01:11:25,179
refreshed by the sleep,
I raised the only remaining sail

583
01:11:25,299 --> 01:11:28,792
And I put my trust in
the friendly wind.

584
01:11:29,229 --> 01:11:30,708
I sailed slowly,

585
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:35,652
waiting patiently for my ship
to bring me somewhere.

586
01:11:39,556 --> 01:11:42,464
After a few days there was
an island in front of me.

587
01:11:42,584 --> 01:11:45,540
A green one and, I guessed,
also a huge one.

588
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:49,674
I turned towards it with a new hope.

589
01:11:50,594 --> 01:11:53,603
I entered a peaceful bay

590
01:11:53,723 --> 01:11:57,804
and encouraged by my curiosity
I threw the anchor there.

591
01:12:10,294 --> 01:12:14,882
After just a few steps in
my exploration of the island

592
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:18,714
I became a captive of funny people

593
01:12:21,852 --> 01:12:25,112
Then I understood that
this is a kingdom of apes

594
01:12:25,232 --> 01:12:27,919
avoided by all proper sailors.

595
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:31,353
First I couldn't complain.
They were very hospitable.

596
01:12:31,473 --> 01:12:35,034
They brought me all
that their island offered.

597
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:40,503
They insisted they I had to stand
with them and learn their way of life.

598
01:12:40,623 --> 01:12:45,125
A very easy way that all
little monkeys are able to learn

599
01:12:46,087 --> 01:12:49,533
I saw well that they weren't
going to ever let me go,

600
01:12:49,653 --> 01:12:52,222
That they were serious about it.

601
01:12:52,508 --> 01:12:56,054
I could only obey them.

602
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:17,960
One night with a bright moon
my decision was made.

603
01:13:18,724 --> 01:13:21,934
I was sick of it all here

604
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:28,637
The bigger was my humiliation
the stronger was my desire to escape.

605
01:13:29,091 --> 01:13:31,911
Silently I set for the bay

606
01:13:32,031 --> 01:13:34,768
Where my ship was still anchored.

607
01:13:56,201 --> 01:13:58,587
In vain did the ship wait

608
01:13:58,707 --> 01:14:02,738
And there were even harder
ape lessons for me

609
01:14:05,078 --> 01:14:10,692
My protests that the living in branches
isn't worthy of a sailor didn't help

610
01:14:11,028 --> 01:14:15,260
No sailor bussiness, squawked they,
this is an ape's empire

611
01:14:15,463 --> 01:14:20,253
I thought then
they must take me for an ape.

612
01:14:20,791 --> 01:14:23,665
But the truth was even worse.

613
01:14:23,785 --> 01:14:28,778
I was only a toy for the
amusement of those scoundrels.

614
01:15:20,887 --> 01:15:21,845
No!

615
01:15:21,965 --> 01:15:25,560
I will no longer be
all the jungle's laughing stock

616
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,495
But I didn't know how to trick
the tricky apes

617
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:32,545
Only when I saw a bunch of grapes

618
01:15:32,665 --> 01:15:36,006
I had a wonderful idea

619
01:15:36,126 --> 01:15:39,065
They had wanted to teach me
the ape's ways

620
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:44,020
I would pay back with teaching them
something of human ways

621
01:15:44,257 --> 01:15:49,517
As I had expected the apes
became easily my good pupils

622
01:15:50,072 --> 01:15:53,530
My revenge was slowly coming together.

623
01:15:59,635 --> 01:16:01,837
When the barrel was full

624
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:05,282
The sun and time completed the work

625
01:16:05,402 --> 01:16:09,819
They even drank the wine without
needing to be taught

626
01:17:18,958 --> 01:17:23,344
After all that fun and dance
the ape's nation fell asleep

627
01:17:23,882 --> 01:17:27,201
It was the time I had been
waiting for so long

628
01:17:27,321 --> 01:17:31,168
Nothing could stop my going
to the bay now

629
01:17:31,764 --> 01:17:36,588
Just away as fast as possible
from this unbearable island

630
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:42,020
Not wanting to loose any time

631
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:45,987
I set off a little boat and
went to the wide sea

632
01:17:46,107 --> 01:17:51,829
Where I always felt the most free
despite all dangers

633
01:17:53,106 --> 01:17:55,459
Goodbye green island!

634
01:17:55,722 --> 01:17:59,025
And let your inhabitants sleep well.

635
01:18:02,488 --> 01:18:04,690
Once more I was welcomed
by the sea-gulls

636
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:07,076
I was happy about their yelling

637
01:18:07,196 --> 01:18:11,934
about the splashing of paddles
and waves and about the new voyage

638
01:18:40,703 --> 01:18:42,871
Dear mercy sleep

639
01:18:42,991 --> 01:18:48,525
capable of injecting a divine relief
even into the biggest suffering

640
01:18:49,798 --> 01:18:54,454
I don't know how long I had been
sailing hungry and thirsty

641
01:18:54,574 --> 01:18:56,403
lost and alone

642
01:18:57,483 --> 01:18:59,667
Only tricky dreams and phantoms...

643
01:18:59,787 --> 01:19:02,508
those companions of exhausted castaways...

644
01:19:02,628 --> 01:19:05,382
brought me into the world of plenty

645
01:19:05,502 --> 01:19:09,156
letting me forget the cruel reality

646
01:19:10,602 --> 01:19:13,341
I was happy at least for a little while

647
01:19:14,013 --> 01:19:17,626
But how dreadful was each awakening.

648
01:19:20,954 --> 01:19:24,164
I felt my end coming

649
01:19:42,169 --> 01:19:46,370
The old friends and faithful mates of my
journeys helped me

650
01:19:46,706 --> 01:19:48,925
They didn't let me starve to death

651
01:19:49,045 --> 01:19:54,030
After refreshing myself
I fought the sea with a new hope

652
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:12,675
Before long I saw an island

653
01:20:13,011 --> 01:20:15,297
It was desolate and parched

654
01:20:15,818 --> 01:20:18,070
Not a single straw of grass

655
01:20:18,828 --> 01:20:23,123
Anyway I went looking for water
to ease my terrible thirst

656
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,559
I didn't find a spring

657
01:20:26,871 --> 01:20:28,300
but a jug

658
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:33,980
An ordinary corked jug made of clay

659
01:20:35,473 --> 01:20:40,574
I hoped some drops were left
for a sailor dying of thirst

660
01:20:53,106 --> 01:20:55,198
Now what's this surprise?

661
01:20:55,988 --> 01:20:57,148
A horror

662
01:20:57,268 --> 01:20:59,938
I've released a daemon!

663
01:21:00,374 --> 01:21:06,340
He had been locked in there ages ago and
since had to wait for his liberator

664
01:21:08,256 --> 01:21:11,172
Instead of being grateful
he got mean

665
01:21:11,292 --> 01:21:14,208
There was no kind of death he wouldn't
promise me...

666
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:17,010
for being imprisoned so long

667
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:20,196
While he was preparing to fulfill
his threats...

668
01:21:20,316 --> 01:21:22,432
A trick occurred to me

669
01:21:22,552 --> 01:21:25,795
I told him, I just couldn't believe that...

670
01:21:25,915 --> 01:21:30,181
he, being so big, could fit into such
a little vessel

671
01:21:30,662 --> 01:21:34,662
And the big boaster displayed his skills
for me

672
01:21:35,368 --> 01:21:37,604
It was my moment

673
01:21:45,144 --> 01:21:48,573
Then all I needed to do was
to cork up the jug.

674
01:21:49,379 --> 01:21:52,454
The imprisoned daemon bagged and moaned

675
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,975
But I didn't trust him anymore

676
01:21:55,290 --> 01:22:00,315
Until he had promised me
to fulfill all my wishes...

677
01:22:00,435 --> 01:22:03,441
As long as I own the jug of clay...

678
01:22:03,561 --> 01:22:06,845
I wouldn't agree to release him.

679
01:22:07,349 --> 01:22:10,794
And I gave him the first order
right away

680
01:22:10,914 --> 01:22:15,136
I wanted him to get me out
of this desolate island

681
01:22:20,484 --> 01:22:24,534
After a long journey above the sea
a shore appeared

682
01:22:24,812 --> 01:22:28,055
Soon I desired a wealthy city an by it

683
01:22:28,438 --> 01:22:30,589
There was a huge well

684
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:33,665
That's where I ordered to land

685
01:22:33,967 --> 01:22:39,102
After fulfilling my wish the daemon
went back to the jug obediently

686
01:22:39,879 --> 01:22:41,492
I felt relief

687
01:22:41,996 --> 01:22:44,114
So he can keep his word

688
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:10,326
Refreshed I realized
I was among the people again

689
01:23:10,446 --> 01:23:14,276
Also my curiosity woke up again

690
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:17,822
Who is hidden in that hilarious sedan?

691
01:23:29,487 --> 01:23:33,038
I had never seen such a beautiful face

692
01:23:34,215 --> 01:23:37,055
No wonder that I lost my head

693
01:23:38,022 --> 01:23:41,467
I made a point to be
the helper of that pretty face

694
01:23:41,587 --> 01:23:44,937
And right away I started

695
01:23:48,501 --> 01:23:52,316
But instead of a comely girl
I got acquainted only with...

696
01:23:52,436 --> 01:23:56,434
the capers and jailers of her father

697
01:23:56,771 --> 01:23:59,796
For she was the daughter
of the sultan himself

698
01:24:00,054 --> 01:24:02,475
...of the lord of this country

699
01:24:16,894 --> 01:24:21,818
I had been honored to meet lots of
sultans before so

700
01:24:21,938 --> 01:24:24,774
this one wasn't too surprising for me

701
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:27,648
and when standing right in front of him

702
01:24:27,768 --> 01:24:30,797
I asked him for his daughter's hand

703
01:24:31,383 --> 01:24:35,399
The sultan hadn't
any understanding for my heart

704
01:24:36,828 --> 01:24:39,080
But why is he so mad?

705
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:42,142
Am I not an honest sailor?

706
01:24:49,076 --> 01:24:52,707
I was to perish in his prison
for my daring

707
01:24:53,849 --> 01:24:57,412
I was thinking it over the whole night
in the dungeon

708
01:24:57,532 --> 01:25:00,152
If only I could have the jug

709
01:25:00,471 --> 01:25:03,211
But it was in the well

710
01:25:04,017 --> 01:25:05,782
I was lost

711
01:27:46,532 --> 01:27:51,793
I said goodbye to princess and begged her
to be patient

712
01:27:52,146 --> 01:27:55,708
I didn't dare to reveal who is my companion

713
01:27:56,044 --> 01:27:58,885
I was rushing towards my secret

714
01:28:03,081 --> 01:28:06,156
By sunset I reached my goal

715
01:28:06,276 --> 01:28:08,795
Fortunately the jug was intact

716
01:28:08,915 --> 01:28:11,913
Now I will show to
the princess and the sultan

717
01:28:12,033 --> 01:28:14,854
I'm not an ordinary sailor

718
01:28:14,974 --> 01:28:17,610
And I gave orders to the daemon

719
01:28:22,652 --> 01:28:24,853
I want a prince's dress

720
01:28:25,677 --> 01:28:27,660
I want a knight's horse

721
01:28:30,801 --> 01:28:33,708
I want servants and suitors

722
01:28:33,828 --> 01:28:35,557
gold

723
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:39,641
Jewels and treasures
that make one dazzle

724
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:42,013
And then

725
01:28:42,133 --> 01:28:46,433
dressed like a magnifico
I went to the sultan's palace

726
01:28:46,553 --> 01:28:51,736
to surprise and dazzle the old master
as well as my future bride

727
01:28:55,051 --> 01:28:58,278
The sultan couldn't get over his ecstasy

728
01:28:58,398 --> 01:29:01,236
He approved the wedding without thinking

729
01:29:01,356 --> 01:29:02,782
without even seeing me

730
01:29:02,902 --> 01:29:07,051
Stupefied as he was by the blaze of gold
and the shine of the precious stones

731
01:29:07,171 --> 01:29:10,446
But the princess said no!

732
01:29:11,065 --> 01:29:14,595
When I had made my plan
it didn't occur to me

733
01:29:14,715 --> 01:29:17,453
That princess in love with
an ordinary sailor

734
01:29:17,573 --> 01:29:20,310
would refuse a rich wooer

735
01:29:20,644 --> 01:29:22,796
The sultan threw a fit

736
01:29:22,916 --> 01:29:24,913
What manners are these?

737
01:29:25,033 --> 01:29:29,166
Disobeying the father and the sultan
equals a rebellion

738
01:29:29,286 --> 01:29:31,990
I give death penalty for that

739
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:34,595
Marry him or I will make you
loose your head

740
01:29:40,519 --> 01:29:45,578
When the princess recognized me
there was nothing more to think about

741
01:29:46,973 --> 01:29:51,040
Without hesitation
I took her out of the palace

742
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:55,579
We were going accompanied with servants
carrying things...

743
01:29:55,699 --> 01:29:59,142
A princess can't do without.

744
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:06,286
We were traveling through mountains
led by sea-gulls in the sky

745
01:30:07,513 --> 01:30:09,984
I knew it was a good sign

746
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:12,249
I was grateful to them in my thoughts

747
01:30:12,369 --> 01:30:16,400
Why, the sea had always meant
happiness for me

748
01:30:24,272 --> 01:30:27,835
When I glanced around I said to my bride

749
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:32,354
There in the highest place
I will take care of everything to you

750
01:30:32,474 --> 01:30:37,070
I will built there a beautiful palace
with a golden roof

751
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:39,978
worthy of you, my love

752
01:31:06,565 --> 01:31:07,574
The jug!

753
01:31:08,616 --> 01:31:10,330
The daemon is free!

754
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:12,733
He's no longer my servant

755
01:31:12,853 --> 01:31:15,125
The magic vanished

756
01:31:24,512 --> 01:31:26,546
What will I do now?

757
01:31:27,016 --> 01:31:28,932
I was desperate

758
01:31:39,986 --> 01:31:45,499
I had wanted to build
a palace with a golden roof for my love

759
01:31:46,339 --> 01:31:49,667
But the bright blue sky was enough...

760
01:31:49,787 --> 01:31:52,069
for our happiness.

761
01:31:52,743 --> 01:31:55,113
So we lived happily...

762
01:31:55,573 --> 01:31:59,325
under the most beautiful roof
in the world.

763
