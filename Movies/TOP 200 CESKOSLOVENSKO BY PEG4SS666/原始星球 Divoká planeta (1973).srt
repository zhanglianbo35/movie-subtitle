1
00:00:33,742 --> 00:01:55,970
FANTASTIC PLANET

2
00:01:55,971 --> 00:03:18,197
She stopped moving

3
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:23,536
Now we can't play
with her any more

4
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:36,840
Careful! It's Mr Sihn

5
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,387
Look, father.
A female Om and her baby

6
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,388
Is she dead?

7
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,264
I'm afraid so, Tiwa

8
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,894
Why does the babymake noise?

9
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,356
It's aither frightened or hungry

10
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:54,422
We can't leave him
May I keep him?

11
00:03:54,423 --> 00:03:57,486
Let me, father
I'll take care of him

12
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:02,408
All right, Tiwa,
we can't let the animal die

13
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:24,118
He was the Great Master
of the Traag people

14
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:45,827
He saved my life
and took me into his home

15
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,684
Mother!

16
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:51,540
Mother!

17
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:56,670
See how cute the little Oms is!

18
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,050
His mother's dead.
I want to keep him

19
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:06,930
He is very pretty, Tiwa

20
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:11,435
You disturbed your mother's Meditation!

21
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:15,774
Make that animal behave
or I'll take it away!

22
00:05:15,775 --> 00:06:03,988
Father, he got away.
He needs a collar

23
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:16,918
Learn to use it Watch

24
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:30,119
Now put the animal down

25
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:43,319
It's fun. Let me try

26
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,112
Not so fast

27
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,240
Tne animal is delicate

28
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:51,244
You might hurt it

29
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,602
Did you name it?

30
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:57,958
Tiwa, like me

31
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:03,381
That's not an Om's name
Name it Frisky or Trusty

32
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:08,178
Watchhim wiggle, the little devil!

33
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:18,063
I'll name him Terr

34
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:27,946
I was forgotten!

35
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:32,494
A baby Om nothing compared
to Meditation!

36
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:33,786
A weird virtual.

37
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,414
Traags devoted
most of their time to it

38
00:07:36,415 --> 00:08:13,534
It seemed to be chief concern

39
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:18,915
Oddly enough, the housing unit factory
on our Uva at Goham...

40
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,835
has not met production levels

41
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:24,754
The machines show unusual wear...

42
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:28,215
This wear cause the delay

43
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:32,387
Master Taj, can you explain?

44
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:33,721
We don't know yet

45
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,934
Meanwhile ve'll use machines
from our reserve...

46
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,082
to meet the schedule

47
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,229
I don't understand

48
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,983
The machines worked
perfectly until now

49
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:52,323
Have you had similar problems
on other Uvas?

50
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:56,452
Only machines from our space flight...

51
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:01,249
to planet Antax 4
have trouble completing their program

52
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,792
Master Sihn, our scientists...

53
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:09,424
explain this loss as a break
in yhe sensory compensation system

54
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:15,055
Scientists also notice that animals
brought from planet Terra...

55
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:19,559
have sovibon
and rather high intelligence

56
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,227
I am not sure that is true

57
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:26,649
Obviously,
the animal adapts rather well

58
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,027
But is that intelligence?

59
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:31,926
The little pet you stroke...

60
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:34,824
between Meditations may well...

61
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,408
surprise you some day

62
00:09:36,409 --> 00:10:10,180
Films made in Terra
show many traces of organized life

63
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:13,774
This ability to adapt, Master Kon

64
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:17,366
may indicate advanced evolution

65
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:21,203
Oms have a much shorter
life span that we

66
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:25,083
But we must not forget
that they multiply much more rapidly

67
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:28,920
It the animal is intelligent,
Master Sihn...

68
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,840
we have not yet noticed

69
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:33,507
Wat we do notice

70
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,759
is the considerable damage...

71
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,347
caused by Oms
on the Uvas of Jext and Telez

72
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:42,934
The numbers of tame Oms
is easy to control

73
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,602
But wild Oms probably exist...

74
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,690
in much larger numbers
than most of us realize

75
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,315
We de-om the enclaves...

76
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,154
of wild Oms every 3 cicles.
But I wonder if...

77
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:55,946
that is often enough

78
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,367
Few weapons have a long-term effect

79
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:02,036
Drastic measures must be taken

80
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:05,206
New ways to fight them
are being researched

81
00:11:05,207 --> 00:14:20,151
I doubt if they will suffice

82
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:25,740
Go play somewhere else

83
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,282
I'm very sorry

84
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,786
Imagination was so rich today too...

85
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:31,078
That Om is a pest!

86
00:14:31,079 --> 00:16:29,322
Plaease, our children
all love those animals

87
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:32,574
I grew up fast
in that slow world

88
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:36,204
A Traag week was equal
to one of my years

89
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:41,272
Iwas only a live plaything

90
00:16:41,273 --> 00:16:46,339
I was sometimes rebellious

91
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,500
Terr loved Tiwa...

92
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:52,511
Repeat!

93
00:16:52,512 --> 00:17:39,224
" Terr loves Tiwa...
Repeat! "

94
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:43,687
Tiwa got her learning
from a headphone

95
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:48,151
Its lessons cut directly
into the brain...

96
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:54,114
engraved on the memory forever

97
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:57,347
" Our Planet Ygam has one satellite...

98
00:17:57,348 --> 00:18:00,580
"the Strange Planet.

"replaces all nosks

116
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:03,434
I liked the lessons

117
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:06,395
I tried to get the most out of them

118
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:10,191
" the cliffs

120
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:16,233
Tiwa, bring your animal!

121
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:20,029
Jurgal has his and we'll have some fun

122
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,409
I don't want him hurt
Jurgal's animal is insane!

123
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,953
Once, he almost tore off his ears!

124
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:33,001
He won't damage your Om.
Come and play!

125
00:21:33,002 --> 00:22:19,672
Come and see!

126
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:23,677
Let Terr fight,
it will be more fun

127
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:27,681
Terr will win,
he's a real demon!

128
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:42,070
Now fight!

129
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:52,581
He sings well

130
00:22:52,582 --> 00:23:01,673
Terr can sing too

131
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:10,764
Sing, Terr. go on!

132
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,810
- Hall strangle him!
- He doesn't realize

133
00:23:13,811 --> 00:24:12,451
What a mean animal!

134
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:17,874
"It is simple to see

136
00:24:30,513 --> 00:24:32,556
Do you hear the Om?

137
00:24:32,557 --> 00:24:34,598
That's Tiwa's lesson!

138
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:38,269
She loves Terr so much
that he is with her always

139
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,022
Can he understand what he says?

140
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:42,731
I don't think so

141
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:48,071
Anyway, I'll forbid her
to keep Terr during Infos

142
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:51,198
She must study seriously

143
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,785
" The liscinian muscle

Have you got Terr again
during you info?

154
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,018
I told you to stop!

155
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:42,166
Into the Omhouse!

156
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,919
But father, he doesn't bother me...

157
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,670
And he's so happy

158
00:25:46,671 --> 00:26:00,017
The Infos are for you!
Get back to work!

159
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:05,982
It was time for the Traag children
to have their first Meditation...

160
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:09,527
The initiation ceremony
was a major step...

161
00:26:09,528 --> 00:27:37,072
on their road to knowledge

162
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:41,473
After a while
I lost my intimacy with Tiwa

163
00:27:41,474 --> 00:28:03,131
As shegrew up, she gave up her playthings

164
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:24,788
Deprived of lessons,
I decided to run away

165
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:27,478
Mother, I can't find Terr

166
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:30,033
An my headphones is gone

167
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:32,586
! use your bracelet

168
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:36,633
If he's far away, it'll hurt him

169
00:28:36,634 --> 00:28:40,679
Put your bracelet on maximun, please

170
00:28:40,680 --> 00:29:27,599
No mother...

171
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,855
You're pretty stupid
! Like all tame Oms!

172
00:29:31,856 --> 00:29:33,564
You have a collar too

173
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:36,568
It'a a fake, to fool the Traags

174
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:39,111
What's that?

175
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:41,156
The Traags invented it

176
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:43,198
What?

177
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:46,286
The Traags made it

178
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:50,956
! Listen

179
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:53,792

00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:02,823
" works the same as
in plane pernetrope "

183
00:30:02,824 --> 00:30:06,765
" Notice that we look
for festation groups "

184
00:30:06,766 --> 00:30:12,020
Don't worry, it's no dangerous

185
00:30:12,021 --> 00:30:17,274
Where are you taking it?

186
00:30:17,275 --> 00:31:24,633
- I don't know.
- Come with me!

187
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:27,199
My new friend took me to her people
who lived hidden in the Big Tree.

188
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,764
My new friend took me to her people
who lived hidden in the Big Tree.

189
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:37,646
deep in an abandoned park

190
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:40,775
As a silly tame Om, my firts meeting

191
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:59,793
with wild Oms was a failure

192
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:23,025
Don't touch that case, it's a trap!

193
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:26,654
Since I brought
the headphone of knowledge...

194
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:29,949
the wizard opposed me at once!

195
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,619
We've brougth 5 cases, Chief

196
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,287
What? Is that all?

197
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:38,291
One of them was a trap and Speed is dead

198
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,919
He knew it was a trap

199
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,961
He's a tame Om

200
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:47,571
He ran away with a Traag device

201
00:32:47,572 --> 00:32:51,565
It taught him to read Traag writing

202
00:32:51,566 --> 00:32:55,558
He knows what's in the cases?

203
00:32:55,559 --> 00:34:32,405
in that one?

204
00:34:32,406 --> 00:36:09,251
Color powder

205
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:13,694
" Urtana is covered
with blue assonic blocks "

206
00:36:13,695 --> 00:36:18,136
" Its temperature range from 8 to 243 laiks... "

207
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:21,890
"making ripocal explitation impossible "

208
00:36:21,891 --> 00:36:25,642
Our Uva, Goham,
has a fepular inland sea

209
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:28,855
" stabilising the
apenosh at about 20 laiks "

210
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:31,003
" Fixations blocks...

211
00:36:31,004 --> 00:36:33,150
" offset ontic rebation "

212
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:37,087
" Er-shaped globes regulate pressure... "

213
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:46,706
Why interrupt the info?

214
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:49,125
Traag knowledge is bad

215
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:51,440
We don't need it

216
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:53,786
We are not tame Oms

217
00:36:53,787 --> 00:36:56,131
It is great offense!

218
00:36:56,132 --> 00:37:00,512
You must battle according to the Law

219
00:37:00,513 --> 00:37:03,514
Bring the combat animals!

220
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:58,319
You win. Stay with us Oms
of the Big Tree

221
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,612
You can be of use to us

222
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:03,657
Tomorrow we go on an expedition

223
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:47,095
<i>It was my first expadition
to steal Traag food</i>

224
00:39:47,096 --> 00:39:49,570
<i>We brought a great deal back</i>

225
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,546
Take heart, the Big Tree isn't far

226
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:14,940
The Hollow-Bush bandits!
Look out!

227
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,351
Why attack us?

228
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:38,021
They're from the Hollow Bush
Beware of them

229
00:40:38,722 --> 00:40:42,322
They are thieves
from the other side of the park

230
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:50,158
The Great Zarek
3000 cycles before Krowp...

231
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:52,993
" Created the pyramidic civilization "

232
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:56,498
" From his tomb - they say
he still animates... "

233
00:40:56,499 --> 00:40:57,998
" the ball of Life "

234
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:02,420
" Projectiles pierce him
but he does not change "

235
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:05,840
" His mind travels through Ygam's skies... "

236
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:09,260
" regulary ever since
he led the Traags... "

237
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:12,554
" to victory againts the Jankos "

238
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:16,371
" This may well be
how Maditation originated "

239
00:41:16,372 --> 00:41:20,187
" Some believe
that Zarek is immortal ands... "

240
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:24,859
" that from the flames of time

241
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,152

00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:31,182
" to combad the Traags will to die "

243
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:33,974
" Actually "

244
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:41,792
" driving out the Jankos made... "

245
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:45,588
" the Traags develop
a spirit of enterprise... "

246
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:47,798
The Oms are learning

247
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:52,637
if only we hand more headphones

248
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:56,975
You know as much as the Traags

249
00:41:56,976 --> 00:42:01,312
I am barely learning to write

250
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:02,627
Look

251
00:45:18,927 --> 00:45:21,261
Are you sure?

252
00:45:21,262 --> 00:45:23,430
Did you read it right?

253
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:27,644
All the park walls read " de-om "!

254
00:45:27,645 --> 00:45:29,103
What does it mean?

255
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:32,732
The Traags want to kill all the Oms!

256
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:34,108
Long ago...

257
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:36,778
I saw them de-om the park

258
00:45:36,779 --> 00:45:38,445
It was horrible!

259
00:45:38,446 --> 00:45:42,867
But now on our tree,
there's not much danger

260
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:45,160
What will we do?

261
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:49,457
- It had to come
- Anyway, we have time to prepare

262
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:52,064
We'll post sentries

263
00:45:52,065 --> 00:45:54,670
They'll slaughter us...

264
00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:57,486
to punish us for stealing knowledge

265
00:45:57,487 --> 00:46:00,300
Let us pray to the Strange Planet

266
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:03,679
Sentries will warn us when they come.
Tomorrow we shall see.

267
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:38,720
What are you doing on our land?

268
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,533
I came to warn you.
The Traags intend to de-om

269
00:47:46,534 --> 00:47:49,452
De-om!
You don't say!

270
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:50,869
How do you know?

271
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:54,081
One of us read it on the wall!

272
00:47:54,082 --> 00:47:58,712
Can Big-Tree Oms
read Traag writing now?

273
00:47:58,713 --> 00:48:00,796
Don't listen to him!

274
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:04,175
It's a trap to get us out
of the Hollow Bush!

275
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:07,262
Believe me, the Traags will de-om!

276
00:48:07,263 --> 00:48:10,180
Take him away!

277
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:13,021
Someone go look at the walls!

278
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:35,596
Listen!

279
00:52:36,614 --> 00:52:38,704
- Traags!
- Quiet!

280
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:52,463
I smell Oms here

281
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:54,924
That vermin!
The Masters should...

282
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:57,134
de-om more often!

283
00:52:57,135 --> 00:53:00,680
It's not bad to have pet Oms...
They're fun

284
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:03,432
But all those wild Oms...
They steal

285
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:07,479
They're dirty
and multiply appallingly fast

286
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,773
Look...
A nest by the valk

287
00:53:09,774 --> 00:53:11,816
See... A whole colony

288
00:53:11,817 --> 00:53:13,175
Let's kill Them

289
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:56,985
Chief is dead

290
00:53:56,986 --> 00:53:59,446
Stop weeping like children

291
00:53:59,447 --> 00:54:04,994
We must go
where the Traags can't find us

292
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:08,373
I know a place,
I'll take you there

293
00:55:25,116 --> 00:55:28,912
This road leads
to an abandoned rocket dump

294
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:31,539
We'll be safe there

295
00:56:20,046 --> 00:56:24,551
I regret that we de-om
only every 3 cycles!

296
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:28,388
This killing proves
it is not enough!

297
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:31,307
A Traag murdered!
It's unbelievable!

298
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:33,810
Are we so weak
that Oms can kill us...

299
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:35,077
So easily?

300
00:56:35,687 --> 00:56:39,816
Wild Oms are much more numerous
than we thought

301
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:41,943
The body showed many...

302
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:47,115
bites and wounds, said Traag
who managed to escape slaughter

303
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:49,784
bites Oms were very numerous

304
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:56,791
Every day wild Oms become bolder!

305
00:56:56,916 --> 00:56:59,419
They multiply at a terrifying rate!

306
00:56:59,544 --> 00:57:03,882
Master Sihn,
it is disturbing to note

307
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:05,717
that your Uva at Telez

308
00:57:05,842 --> 00:57:08,511
is not the only one that has been.

309
00:57:08,803 --> 00:57:11,014
very difficult to de-om

310
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:12,432
Two other Uvas...

311
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:15,352
Goham and Urtana...

312
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:18,063
have hand similar problems...

313
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,983
Near the murdered Traag we found...

314
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:25,320
two surprisingly well organized lairs

315
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:28,865
mot disturbing of all was that...

316
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:30,617
in one of the lairs...

317
00:57:30,742 --> 00:57:34,454
cases were sorted
according to contents

318
00:57:34,579 --> 00:57:37,832
But they were unopened.
How could the Oms

319
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:40,168
Know what they contained?

320
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:44,798
It is high time
to take efficient measures!

321
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:48,093
I suggest we de-om twice a cycle

322
00:57:48,218 --> 00:57:52,931
I also request stric regulation
of the breeding...

323
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:55,642
and selling of tame Oms

324
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:58,144
Too often they turn wild again...

325
00:57:58,395 --> 00:58:01,064
and go join the throngs of Oms...

326
00:58:01,189 --> 00:58:04,025
living in parks
and other isolated areas

327
00:58:04,192 --> 00:58:09,155
We must use the new, much-discussed
de-om-ing devices at last

328
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,576
We must exterminate all wild Oms.
And I ask you:

329
00:58:13,702 --> 00:58:16,496
Should we keep our tame Oms?

330
00:58:16,663 --> 00:58:21,376
We are wrong to believe Oms
are merely vicious animals

331
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:23,503
If we do, we may commit...

332
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:26,339
an erro de serious consequence

333
00:58:58,163 --> 00:58:59,789
Ygam had..

334
00:58:59,956 --> 00:59:02,876
3 seasons equal to...

335
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:04,836
15 of our years

336
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:19,142
The Traag rocket graveyard
was abandoned

337
00:59:19,267 --> 00:59:21,770
There we built our city

338
00:59:21,895 --> 00:59:25,148
We planned to go
to the Strange Planet

339
00:59:25,815 --> 00:59:28,485
Many tame and wild Oms
came to join us

340
01:00:18,535 --> 01:00:21,705
Knowledge asquired
from the headphone...

341
01:00:21,913 --> 01:00:24,124
enable us to reduce...

342
01:00:24,249 --> 01:00:26,167
Traag rockets...

343
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:28,211
to our size

344
01:00:37,053 --> 01:00:42,100
" Trinur is a metal
that palsifies Matwar

345
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:47,147
top-grade reculid gives it
a remarkable metallic shine "

346
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:56,531
We have succeeded, Terr

347
01:00:56,656 --> 01:00:58,574
Two rockets are for testing

348
01:00:58,575 --> 01:00:59,909
Two rockets are ready for testing

349
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:03,580
- It's only a matter of work and time
- We must hurry!

350
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:07,042
Many time Om informers say...

351
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:09,544
that a large-scale
de-om-ing is near!

352
01:01:09,669 --> 01:01:12,255
They may know where we are

353
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:43,198
Whe must send up
our two rockets at once...

354
01:03:43,573 --> 01:03:46,201
to see if we can live
on the Strange Planet

355
01:03:46,659 --> 01:03:48,536
We cannot wait any longer!

356
01:03:48,661 --> 01:03:52,374
Too bad. I can't go with you

357
01:03:52,624 --> 01:03:56,127
I'm not afraid.
I'm sure you'll succeed

358
01:03:57,379 --> 01:03:59,047
I know you will build...

359
01:03:59,214 --> 01:04:02,842
a new world
where Oms can be happy...

360
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:04,594
for away from the Traags

361
01:04:05,136 --> 01:04:08,098
The Strange Planet
will be our planet...

362
01:04:08,598 --> 01:04:11,309
a world for our children

363
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:13,228
You must go!

364
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:15,730
You must hurry!

365
01:04:16,439 --> 01:04:17,565
You must...

366
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:07,801
We had discovered
the secret of the Traags

367
01:06:08,134 --> 01:06:12,138
The Spheres of Meditation there
enabled Traags to meet...

368
01:06:12,305 --> 01:06:16,017
beings from other galaxies
and hold strange nuptial rites

369
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:23,483
This union gave them vital anergy
which they needed...

370
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:26,903
and enabled them to reproduce

371
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:04,733
We were afraid...

372
01:07:04,858 --> 01:07:08,319
The statues feet
might damage our rockets

373
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:20,707
We found
the only weak point of yhe Traags

374
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:25,795
On Ygam, the de-om-ing was halted

375
01:08:09,255 --> 01:08:13,426
Never have the Traags
been in such great danger!

376
01:08:13,551 --> 01:08:16,554
Our entired civilization is threatened!

377
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:18,848
The Oms atre taking revenge

378
01:08:18,973 --> 01:08:22,018
They have incredible
scientific knowledge

379
01:08:22,352 --> 01:08:24,145
They must be stopped

380
01:08:26,731 --> 01:08:28,608
It may be too late

381
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:32,112
Neither Oms nor Traags...

382
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:35,448
will profit from destruction

383
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,242
We must try
to make peace

384
01:08:56,219 --> 01:08:58,138
" Sine the Sihn era,

385
01:08:58,263 --> 01:09:03,143
the Traag civilization has undergone
a remarkable evolution

386
01:09:03,393 --> 01:09:06,479
" The Oms, instructed
by our philosophy and...

387
01:09:06,646 --> 01:09:07,856
Technology...

388
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:10,108
now provide the Traags with...

389
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:14,029
dynamic sitality
and a new way of thinking

390
01:09:14,154 --> 01:09:19,451
Our palnet now has two satellites
one natural and one artficial

391
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:22,695
The natural one, the Strange Planet...

392
01:09:22,696 --> 01:09:25,081
is keep for Traag Meditation

393
01:09:25,206 --> 01:09:29,461
The artificial one was made by de Oms.
They named it Terr.

394
01:09:29,586 --> 01:09:33,882
" Oms live in huge cities
on the various Uvas "
