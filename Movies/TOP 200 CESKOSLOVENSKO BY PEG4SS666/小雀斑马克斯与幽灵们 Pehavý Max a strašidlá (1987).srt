1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,630
It all began under the Frankenstein
castle.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,996
It was my tenth year with this circus troupe

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,153
and we were passing through a bleak
territory of vampires,

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,438
will-o'-the-wisps, and water sprites.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,637
Hurry, as quick as you can!

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,270
The ring master whipped
the anxious horses.

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,353
But I had other things on my mind.

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,908
Lazy bones!

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,796
Keep cleaning, and do it right,
you have to earn your bread!

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,759
I sensed an opportunity
to run away.

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,310
They'd been getting on my nerves
for quite a while.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,912
They used the fact that I was an orphan.

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,595
They never paid me

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,036
and they even made me do girls' jobs.

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,159
This is a dangerous place!

16
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,358
Hurry up or we get stuck her overnight!

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,000
Gee!

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,117
Miriam!

19
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,394
We feed him, this kid...

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,634
And look what he did, the bastard!

21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,630
Witch!

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,995
You'll go hungry for this!

23
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,548
No dinner, and no food tomorrow either!

24
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,396
- He bit me!
- Don't you dare beating me!

25
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,597
- Just you wait!
- You're not my mother!

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,558
She cared nothing for you,

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,949
and I should rack my nerves
trying to raise you?!

28
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,156
I don't need you to raise me!

29
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,877
I'll put you in an orphanage
the first chance I get!

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,076
I'll find better guardians!

31
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,869
First you'd have to run away!

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,428
Let him try!

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,512
Go if you want to run into a vampire.

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,072
Come back, you darn kid!

35
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,832
- He ran off, the little bandit!
- So what?

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,230
- Who's gonna feed the horses?
- Devil may care!

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,549
I said good-bye to the circus.

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,358
And that was the beginning of the craziest
adventure of my life.

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,235
Don't be scared. I won't hurt you.

40
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,629
Is the water fairy still at the circus?

41
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,392
What water lady?

42
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,430
The beauty up front, at the wagon.

43
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,719
I don't know.

44
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,394
Are you very hungry?

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,797
Eat!

46
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,713
But it's still alive.

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,471
You don't like fresh fish?

48
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,516
Come, we'll find something to eat.

49
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,916
The Slovak Film Institute
presents

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,875
FRECKELD MAX AND THE GHOSTS

51
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,238
Based on Frankenstein's Aunt
by Alan Rune Pettersson.

52
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,797
Screenplay by:

53
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,954
Count Dracula! Your brain! Got it?

54
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,029
Excellent!

55
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,398
Enough talking! Let it cool!

56
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,235
Henry Frankenstein had waited years
for this moment.

57
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,595
Script editor:

58
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,793
Directed by:

59
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,399
Friends! This day will enter
the annals of human history.

60
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,355
- Brain!
- Here.

61
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,992
Brand new and fresh,
Doctor Frankenstein.

62
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,230
My goodness! You left it to freeze?

63
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,993
The count told me...

64
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,155
I said let it cool,
I didn't say put it in the freezer!

65
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,439
I've waited for ages for
Professor Sedlmayer to die!

66
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,280
I am sorry, sir Henry.

67
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,353
He was one of the greatest geniuses,

68
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,868
and you freeze his brain to stone!

69
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,030
What if you damaged some
important section of it?

70
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,795
- I'll try warm it up.
- Scalpel!

71
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,158
Here you go.
Telephone, please.

72
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,071
Telephone!

73
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,670
I can't work like this!

74
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,398
Dashing. What're we going
to call him?

75
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,840
I suggest Henry II, after you.

76
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,718
Thank you so much.

77
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,799
But he will beat us in significance
and intelligence. Hopefully.

78
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,080
My favorite apprentice has
a fitting name. Einstein.

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,468
The Joseph who visited here
during the holidays?

80
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,950
No. Einstein's name is Albert.

81
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,794
Fascinating. Very original!

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,879
May happiness be his companion
in all his life!

83
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,279
May your name be Albert!

84
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,231
Zipper!

85
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,717
Careful, countess.

86
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,356
I have to attach it right,
otherwise he'll be a leftie.

87
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,837
What is it, Igor?

88
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,479
The electricity will kick in soon,
the antennas are up!

89
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,668
Now, we wake up his
nervous system.

90
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,194
The further the worse, Alojz.

91
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,878
See that liver? Go, don't be scared!

92
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,833
No trout!

93
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,439
Ok, two beers then, that's all.

94
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,674
- Three. Pilsners.
- No!

95
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,630
Do you want to drink yourself to death?

96
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,636
- Touché!
- Dame!

97
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,554
I'm taking that.

98
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,916
This too!

99
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,836
Help!

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,150
Guys, we got a problem!

101
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,992
What's going on?

102
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,072
Terrible things are happening
at the castle.

103
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,798
Give him some liquor!

104
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,956
- Plum brandy!
- Coming up!

105
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,276
Wake up!

106
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,396
It was a vampire.

107
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,114
Up at the castle.

108
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,672
Count Frankenstein put together
a horrible monster.

109
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,590
Just like his uncle five hundred years ago.

110
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,952
I saw it myself. Look!

111
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,475
He let the dragons out.

112
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,348
When the lightning strikes them,
the monster comes alive!

113
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,399
Nonsense. Nobody can construct
a human being.

114
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,630
It has happened in the past.
My grandfather saw it.

115
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,759
We cannot let it come to that!

116
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,639
I must go to the castle right away.

117
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,392
I'm coming with you!

118
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,799
You came to see us, brother?
You decided to do some work?

119
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,874
Later, Berta. I don't have time for this.

120
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,032
I have to show them
who the inventor is around here!

121
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,680
They are going to see one Hufschmied!

122
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,229
It won't be long before I get married!

123
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,514
Never again will I touch a hammer!

124
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,030
Until then, you just keep picking it up!

125
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,876
You work! I'll be famous!
My name will be in all the papers!

126
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,196
Excellent!

127
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,555
And now let's see if everything works
like it should.

128
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,316
The hand... the fingers.

129
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,438
And now the major stuff:
Speech and sight!

130
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,754
The sight is perfect, but...

131
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,876
Come on, what's wrong with you?
Say something!

132
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,873
It should work!
Everything functions!

133
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,634
Wait! Say something!

134
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,235
Say it loud and clear!

135
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,550
Here I am!

136
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,393
Are you in the netherworld?

137
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,754
I'm in the channel!

138
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,356
Is that you, Alojz? What's going on?

139
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,551
You should be ashamed of yourself!
Getting drunk and make a mess!

140
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,798
There's something I've got to tell you.

141
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,832
The whole town is on its feet.
The men are coming here.

142
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,555
Now you'll see what my invention
can do!

143
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,598
Don't go! Come back!

144
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,035
A child speaks when you
slap his butt.

145
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,630
That's very unscientific.

146
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,028
Let me think!

147
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,119
Think fast, those people will be here
any minute now.

148
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,509
A scientist cannot act in haste.

149
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,876
We'll set the castle on fire!

150
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,997
Beat all the spooks!

151
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,076
Why won't you talk, stubborn thing?

152
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,914
Lie on your belly! Turn around!

153
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,915
Don't you dare! It's unscientific.

154
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,833
People do it - you said so yourself!

155
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,151
My goodness! Look at how ugly he is!

156
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,708
It's not beauty that counts!

157
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,919
But his strength will save us.

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,395
It works! Welcome, Professor!

159
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,959
How do you feel?

160
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,874
Fantastic! Excellent!

161
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,314
Are you all right?

162
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,872
Come on, guys!

163
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,955
We'll deal with the count
once and for all!

164
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,719
Albert will win them over,
you'll see.

165
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,951
Professor, once again!

166
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,358
Welcome to the castle
of Count Farkastein!

167
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,797
Frankenstein.

168
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,310
We hope you will...
have a pleasant visit!

169
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,191
Open the gates!

170
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,949
Open, or we'll break it!

171
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,753
Let us in and hand over the monster!

172
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,355
Open, otherwise we'll use
heavy machinery!

173
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,832
Quiet, citizens!

174
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,031
Welcome to the castle
of Count Frankenstein!

175
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,032
We hope you will have
a pleasant visit!

176
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,438
That's him!

177
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,757
Welcome to the castle
of Count Frankenstein...

178
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,672
He's trying to fool us!

179
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,957
Albert knows no fear.

180
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,430
Calm down, Albert knows no fear.

181
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,273
You, butcher, give him,
you're strong.

182
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,839
What is fear?

183
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,120
Be sensible, I made him for you!

184
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,193
- He doesn't feel anything.
- He's not human.

185
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,669
He's a monster!

186
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,998
It's a terrible misunderstanding!

187
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,358
Step aside now!
I'll start my fireworks.

188
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,716
Be reasonable, people!
Think!

189
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,791
You still want to know fear?

190
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,872
Is this fear?

191
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,389
Welcome to the castle
of Count Frankenstein...

192
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,871
Throw it away!
He can't throw it away! He's done!

193
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,829
No answer.

194
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,751
And he promised he would call,
my famous nephew Henry.

195
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,995
Pack my suitcase, Charlie,
I'm going to the castle!

196
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,276
It's time to see the ghosts.

197
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,479
I was a little girl when they sent me
off to school.

198
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,472
But I remember you, Countess.

199
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,119
So you're from Frankenstein, Miss?

200
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,430
Call me Claire.

201
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,593
And now you're coming back.

202
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,554
A lovely, educated young lady!
How long are you visiting for?

203
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,269
I'm coming back to stay. I'll work
with my mother at the pharmacy.

204
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:23,870
Come see us at the castle...
if you're brave.

205
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,793
I'm not sure. I think I am.

206
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,870
Frankenstein!

207
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,993
- Claire, here I am!
- Mom!

208
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,354
Good-bye,
Countess Frankenstein!

209
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,238
Don't forget to come visit us!
I'll introduce you to my nephew!

210
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,869
I won't forget!
See you later, Countess!

211
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,153
Watch out, after that scandal
everything is damaged.

212
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,390
It's in desolate condition!

213
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,994
There used to be a door here. Open!

214
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,755
It's destroyed.

215
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,998
I should sell the castle to the government.

216
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,834
Why? It needs to be reconstructed!

217
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,478
- Waste of money.
- It's a great castle.

218
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,195
What if he's hiding here?

219
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,117
Are you here, Henry?

220
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,396
He's not here. Let's proceed, Madam!

221
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,758
I don't like this.

222
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,630
This is where it all happened,
at the lab.

223
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,119
This used to be the armory
of Count Theodore.

224
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:22,075
You've done some work here,
dear ghosts!

225
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,352
The Countess never found her nephew
at the castle.

226
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,035
Then she invited all its inhabitants
to a dinner party, which was nice,

227
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,752
because they behaved strangely here.
Nobody gave me anything.

228
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,398
I was worried that my spooks never eat.

229
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,192
A raw steak for Mister librarian.

230
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,430
He likes it bloody.

231
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,840
Bread and water for the White Lady.

232
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,033
I'll make an exception.
I'll have the fish.

233
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,917
Sorry, I didn't see.

234
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,834
Enjoy!

235
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,753
You're not wearing you glasses!?

236
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,071
Have you gone nuts, Sepp?
What are you doing here?

237
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,311
I don't know this gentleman.

238
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,153
"I don't know this gentleman."

239
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,071
I'm Fiery Sepp!

240
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,278
I'd shake your hand, but mine
is too hot.

241
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,512
Sir Henry made a slight mistake
when he calculated energy.

242
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,275
Are you Henry's creation too?

243
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,229
When he tried to fix me,
he almost burned himself!

244
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,670
Igor! My sherry is gone!

245
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,915
Sherry. I've never drunk that before.

246
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,514
- What's your name?
- Max.

247
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,878
- And?
- Just Max.

248
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,032
Everyone has a surname.

249
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,756
We're friends, I'll give you a name.

250
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,834
I'll call you Freckle.

251
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,673
Max Freckle Frecklenini,
like Paganini.

252
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,752
- Frecklenini?
- A great artist!

253
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,076
I have a name!

254
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,715
Max Freckle Frecklenini!

255
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,270
- Want to go for a ride?
- Sure!

256
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,632
Careful, Frecklenini!

257
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,558
Good evening! Welcome home,
Countess!

258
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,394
You're still alive?

259
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,517
I'm immortal. I got news about
your nephew.

260
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,838
You know where he is?

261
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,639
At your house in Yorkshire.

262
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,513
- How do you know?
- I got my bats.

263
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,878
I send out signals to other bats,
they forward the message...

264
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,638
Us bats, we have a perfect system
for communication.

265
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,349
I'm amazed, Count Dracula.

266
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,039
I feel something now.
Certain vibrations.

267
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,599
Henry wants to call you.

268
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,799
He's walking to the telephone,
he's calling the operator...

269
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:53,230
He's giving your number.
They just connected him and...

270
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,678
This is Henry, Auntie! How are you?

271
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:12,198
I want to tell you that you turned
the castle into ruins.

272
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,637
That's the risk of business.

273
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,478
I've been working on a new idea.
It needs focus!

274
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,400
The castle needs to be renovated!
You have to come back!

275
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,838
The line is bad, I can't hear you.

276
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,469
It's a terrible connection!

277
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:49,159
You no longer want to sell the
family castle.

278
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,110
- Who said such nonsense?
- Igor said!

279
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,713
Igor spreads gossip and panic.

280
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,990
- Ladies and gentlemen, to the castle!
- And to the Countess!

281
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,390
May she forgive us our sins
ans be with us for a long time yet.

282
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,869
Until the end of the world.

283
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,317
Stop!

284
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,475
Everybody, over here! I found Albert!

285
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,520
He opened his eyes.

286
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,393
He's alive!

287
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,355
Wake up, old friend!

288
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,589
Welcome to the castle
of Count Frankenstein.

289
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,034
Welcome back to the world!

290
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,476
And we have a pair of hands
stronger than ten others!

291
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,950
I'm thirsty! Give me something to drink!

292
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,238
Albert, that's not whipped cream!

293
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,670
- Brush it strongly, Max!
- Is this your way?

294
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,514
So, Albert was born again.

295
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,319
With the soul of a child
and the strength of a giant.

296
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,037
Soon, the castle was like new.

297
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,549
But the Countess did not let him rest.

298
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,076
Without mercy, she ordered
his humanization.

299
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,872
Poor thing! I wanted to teach him
about the world,

300
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,198
but she sent him to the library,

301
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,515
as if books could educate you
how to live.

302
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,190
This is a man? He looks like me.

303
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,397
That's correct, that's a man.

304
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,711
And what's this?

305
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:41,074
A w-o-m-a-n. That's like you,
a woman.

306
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,436
What, me? Me, a woman?

307
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:52,794
A woman is something beautiful,
ethereal, and mysterious.

308
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,796
She offered him her lips.

309
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,519
Lovely... her lips.

310
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,915
- Max, will you be all right?
- Sure!

311
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,440
Has a woman ever offered you
her lips?

312
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,636
My mom.

313
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,477
But then she disappeared and I never
saw her again.

314
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,480
And is this not your mother?

315
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,118
No. She's the kind...

316
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,512
that goes with anybody.

317
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,557
Enough! A am a grown up man!

318
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,555
I have the right to a woman!

319
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,678
I want a bride!

320
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,755
Don't hurt me!

321
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,392
- Do I know you?
- I came to help you.

322
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,269
I know a woman
who would give you her lips.

323
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,876
- She likes to kiss?
- Why not? Yes.

324
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,037
And she's strong, and pretty,
like you.

325
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,477
Here, sit down.

326
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,394
You have a lovely zipper on your head!

327
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,950
You are the only person who
really wants to help me.

328
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,876
But don't tell anyone.
It's going to be our secret.

329
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,555
Help! I'm drowning!

330
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,592
Could you be a little more quiet?

331
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:31,596
- But I'm not doing anything.
- You're disturbing my peace.

332
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,958
- I haven't said a word!
- Do you want to argue with me?

333
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,068
What's all that sighing and whining?

334
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,831
- I apologize. Should I leave?
- Yes, please.

335
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,669
Or stop whimpering!
It makes me nervous!

336
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,273
- So what am I supposed to do?
- Look for a bride yourself!

337
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,555
Myself?

338
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:04,631
Every decent man looks for
a wife himself.

339
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,839
You don't want to be my bride?

340
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,229
You're talking nonsense.

341
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,591
I feel that I like you.

342
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,071
He passed through the wall!

343
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,597
- Watch out, man, step aside!
- Me?

344
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,914
- Oh my goodness!
- Wait!

345
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,590
It's the monster from the castle!

346
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,433
Alarm!

347
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,478
Into the shelter!

348
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,476
Inside, now! It's the monster
from the castle!

349
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,078
Look how horrible he is!

350
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,155
He's like a child.

351
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,717
Just you wait!

352
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,638
Let it be, I'll take care of it!

353
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,271
Albert! Come and see
if I can fulfill my promise.

354
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,236
- You know what I mean, right?
- Our little secret.

355
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,913
You and I - we're friends, right?

356
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,394
I am sure you will like her.

357
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,719
This is my sister.

358
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,589
You should get to know each other!

359
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,589
- I'm Albert.
- Albert who?

360
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,913
Just Albert is enough.

361
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,754
He's a good friend of mine, right?

362
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,719
My name is Berta.

363
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,078
Is this my suitor?

364
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,510
Isn't she pretty?

365
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,197
She weighs at least 300 pounds!

366
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,069
Are you as strong as you look?

367
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,716
He has to go!
He'll destroy our houses!

368
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,870
Go, kids!

369
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,988
- What's he up to?
- He's destroying our town.

370
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,638
I just wanted Berta to like me.

371
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,234
We have to tie him up,
or he'll kill us all!

372
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,233
Calm down!
He hasn't done anything wrong!

373
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,154
That's my tree! I told him
to tear it out of the ground!

374
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,116
Albert may not be coming back.

375
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,278
Don't worry. We cannot have everything
we'd like.

376
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,158
Easy for you to say,
but I don't have anybody.

377
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,758
- And whom do I have?
- The Countess and the ghosts.

378
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,591
But there are things I will never have.

379
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,399
I cannot sleep.

380
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:05,317
I lie awake at night, eyes open...

381
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,996
That's how unhappy I am...

382
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,396
And it's getting worse.

383
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,239
- But why?
- I'm cursed.

384
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:32,471
- Have you done something bad?
- Yes. It's hard to talk about it.

385
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:42,358
Something terrible. With Elisabeth,
the White Lady.

386
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,398
Can anybody help you?

387
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:53,117
Yes, but I cannot say how.

388
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,750
We are in the power of the Iron Man.

389
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,193
I can save you, and Albert too.

390
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,590
So, how about you, genius?
You haven't learned much.

391
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,836
You must get better, if you want to
make an impression on Berta.

392
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,435
Will she offer me her lips then?

393
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,591
You'll see.

394
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,235
Why does your sister need
so many sleeping pills?

395
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,110
It's not just for her.

396
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,678
I can't sleep either.

397
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,151
- How can I help, Mr. Hufschmied?
- Isn't that too much?

398
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:46,513
Give him what he asks for.
He's the customer.

399
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,313
What are you looking for,
little freckled freak?

400
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,436
- Who are you?
- Iron Theodor.

401
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,274
I forbid you to sniff around
for our secrets!

402
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,635
You're not my father,
you don't tell me what to do.

403
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:22,151
- So, Berta?
- Good... I had a drink.

404
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,831
What, you too? Get up!

405
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,915
You silly cow, you drank from it?
Berta, wake up!

406
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,675
They're drunk.

407
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,350
You have to help me!
Wake up!

408
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,877
I'm worried about Albert.
God knows what happened to him?

409
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,269
It was his decision to leave.

410
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,315
He's like a child, he could get hurt.
Igor says...

411
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,916
Enough of Igor!
He's just a servant.

412
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,069
- You don't like him?
- Pay attention!

413
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,440
Albert went off to look for love.

414
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,275
- At the blacksmith's?
- That's where he chose to go.

415
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,828
You want to get rid of him.

416
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,792
Like my mom wanted to get rid of me.

417
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,833
- Alojz!
- Here I am, Freckle!

418
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,549
- Start!
- Yes, sir!

419
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,233
I have a bad feeling about Albert.

420
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,680
Now you go.

421
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,592
Don't worry, they were all fast asleep.

422
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,558
Except for the blacksmith.

423
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,911
What? The blacksmith
is up to something!

424
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,839
- Go get help!
- Just sleep!

425
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,596
We'll take a look
at Frankenstein's secret.

426
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:54,229
Lalali, lalala,
your head opens up, lalala!

427
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,277
Wake up! You have to help us!

428
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,318
Your brother wants to hurt Albert.

429
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:18,228
I'm Siegfried Hufschmied,
the greatest inventor of all times.

430
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,280
- Open!
- Come, Sepp!

431
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:31,390
Let me warm up! May I?
I want to use my invention.

432
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,431
- What an invention!
- I call it laser.

433
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,876
Attack! Out of the way, Max!

434
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,794
Help! Quick!

435
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,117
Igor, quick! I think Albert is hurt!

436
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,390
Go back to the castle!

437
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,077
Leave the chains!

438
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:18,109
- I can't untie him!
- You shouldn't be here! Stop!

439
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,916
- The chain won't let go!
- Let's see that!

440
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,749
That's gunpowder!
Help!

441
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,112
Albert is on fire!
We have to untie him!

442
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,239
Water!

443
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,470
Firefighters! My workshop is on fire!

444
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,638
You idiot! Go to hell with
your stupid inventions!

445
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,036
It's that monster's fault!

446
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,715
It was arson, he's a criminal!
And you have to pay damages!

447
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,269
- Put him here.
- Careful!

448
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,956
- You'll pay me for this!
- Off the carriage, Huschmied!

449
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,713
Claire, save him!

450
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,276
He needs help immediately.
He could die.

451
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,793
He's running a temperature.
We have to beat the fever down.

452
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,790
- What is it?
- A zipper.

453
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,114
Albert is a modern man.

454
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,078
We never learned at school about this.

455
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:10,473
When I was little, mom would
blow on it when I was hurting.

456
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,390
Shall I try?

457
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,709
It always helped me.

458
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,550
It worked - the fever is dropping.

459
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,031
- He's better.
- It always helps.

460
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:45,150
Can you hear me, Albert?
I'm Claire.

461
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,115
Can you see me?

462
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:00,475
- He's pale, he lost a lot of blood.
- Young, fresh blood.

463
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,795
He'll sleep for a long time,
sleep is healing.

464
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,634
I'm glad you are here.

465
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,475
Would you like to stay overnight?

466
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,553
No, thank you. My mother cannot
find out that I was here.

467
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,073
I sneaked out, she doesn't know.

468
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,391
I'll send Igor, he'll take you back.

469
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,394
- Your coat.
- I'll take you home.

470
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,398
I will! I will!

471
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,629
- So who's going to take me?
- Me, me...

472
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,718
Gentlemen, what is this
supposed to mean?

473
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,430
You're bothering this lovely
young lady.

474
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:50,112
To your service, Madam.
Count Dracula from Transylvania.

475
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,115
That's the monsoon in India.

476
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,629
And this is the Opera La Scala.

477
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,230
And if I stretch out my arms,
it plays in stereo.

478
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,994
That's impressive, but...

479
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:26,234
Just a moment... Do you recognize
this voice?

480
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,754
Claire! We're waiting for you!
Mr Hans is here!

481
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,114
My mother!

482
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,829
The mayor's son is here!

483
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,789
Open up! He brought you roses!

484
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,154
Please, take me home right away.

485
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,800
It will be my pleasure.

486
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,235
But the sun is still high!

487
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,989
I'll take counter measures.

488
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,276
We're flying!

489
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,396
Faster!

490
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,871
What was that?

491
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,794
You're safe in my hands.

492
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,191
A fireball!

493
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,674
- A fireball, Fiery Sepp!
- Shouldn't we land?

494
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,438
For that nobody?
We'll fly higher instead.

495
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,399
People of his rank
cannot follow us there.

496
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:06,516
- What's going on?
- She locked the door and won't talk.

497
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,111
- I'm worried about her.
- Miss Claire!

498
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:35,070
Leave her alone!
Who will help Albert?

499
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,590
Careful! You'll break the door!

500
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,838
You'll help us. Let's try together.

501
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,589
She wouldn't harm herself,
would she?!

502
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,877
Quiet! She's alive!

503
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,629
Go out! I have to close the window!

504
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,631
Claire!

505
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,595
Albert, what are you doing?

506
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,754
Get out!

507
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,718
Hello. I was just coming to see you.

508
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,919
I saved you a trip then.

509
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,953
Can I borrow your bicycle?

510
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,476
It will be my pleasure to run
beside you.

511
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,556
I'm going far!

512
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,519
Doesn't matter. I'd follow you
to the world's end.

513
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,757
You have to run faster then!

514
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,310
- Not to the castle!
- Why?

515
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,559
Come back! Aren't you afraid?

516
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,517
Yes, me. How did you know?

517
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:28,915
You have the softest hands.
You must be beautiful.

518
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,670
I'll remove the bandage and you'll see me.

519
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,632
- How do you feel?
- Great, when you are here.

520
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,156
I called you.

521
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,470
Now sit quietly! Don't move!

522
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,112
I think I'm in heaven. I see an angel.

523
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,913
...on my bicycle, to the castle.

524
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:38,198
No way! She's in her room.
I talked to her a minute ago.

525
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,192
- Can I see her?
- Of course you can.

526
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,032
But calm down a little first.

527
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,670
We're closed, come back later!

528
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,032
In the afternoon.

529
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:04,873
It was horrible,
but I feel better now.

530
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,634
You'll see her. She's taking a nap.

531
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,917
I think Claire is up now.

532
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,599
Claire, where are you?

533
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,712
Come!

534
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,955
You see? Do you still have
a headache?

535
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,356
You look pale.

536
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,797
I had a terrible dream.

537
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,633
You went to the end of the world
on my bicycle.

538
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,678
If you came by bike,
it must be outside.

539
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,676
Outside!

540
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,390
My bicycle!

541
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,355
I'll come again!

542
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,237
If the mayor finds out,
everything could fall apart.

543
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:47,155
You're nursing such a monster.
It will cost you such a husband!

544
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,630
Albert is not a monster.
He even likes poetry.

545
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,756
I can't take this anymore!

546
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,669
You're driving me crazy.

547
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,552
Who's disturbing my sleep?
Is it so late already?

548
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,316
Your tea, my lord.

549
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,954
- What do you think about those two?
- You don't want them to be happy?

550
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,678
That's not the point.

551
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:35,752
You know what happens if
the two lovers have to be separated?

552
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,758
There will be two more ghosts
wandering around the world.

553
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,876
Why ghosts?

554
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:51,310
When someone ends up alone,
he turns into a ghost.

555
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,758
Is that what happened to all of you
here at the castle?

556
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,196
No. To all people walking the earth.

557
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:11,880
- So you too were Ionely.
- Your tea is truly delicious.

558
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,278
Put your hand on your heart
and start with yout left foot.

559
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:28,478
It's just a question of will.
Try!

560
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,590
I want to pass through the wall
and I can do it!

561
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,951
Albert, did you see that?
I passed through the wall!

562
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,119
I want to pass through the wall
and I can do it!

563
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,238
What's that going to be, a cradle?

564
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,351
I wanted to make something nice for her.

565
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,639
So that she would see how clever I am.

566
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,750
A cradle for Claire?

567
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,239
Is she expecting a baby?

568
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,793
There's going to be a scandal!

569
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:01,908
Is that you, Albert? How handsome!
I almost didn't recognize you.

570
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,394
I came to thank you
for all you have done for me.

571
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:16,119
- And please accept this small gift.
- A gift? For me?

572
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,116
A cradle?

573
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,115
That's so nice!

574
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,996
Did you do it yourself?

575
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,674
Let's take it inside.
My mother is not at home.

576
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,191
Do you like it?

577
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:03,157
- Why is it so big?
- It's for two.

578
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,755
Come one then.

579
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:19,595
You are so serious as if you were
ready to declare your love for me.

580
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,355
That's why I'm here.

581
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,590
First you just wanted to thank me,

582
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,679
then there was the gift,

583
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,590
now you want to declare your love.
What's next?

584
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,710
You'd make me extremely happy...

585
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,952
if you offered me your lips.

586
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,554
My lips?

587
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,279
They're right here!

588
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,390
What's going on here?

589
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,194
Do you hear me? Stop that!

590
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,636
This monster dared to kiss you?

591
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:25,474
- Albert is not a monster!
- Go to your room!

592
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,710
He brought me a gift!

593
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,360
Don't be mad at Claire.
It's all my fault!

594
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:34,399
Out! Get out!

595
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,594
Get out! You monster!

596
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,956
- Albert, I'll help you.
- How?

597
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:42,594
- We'll turn you into a dandy.
- Hardly.

598
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,276
The relationship between a man
and a woman is based on dance.

599
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,433
Graceful steps will lead you to love.

600
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,510
Shall we dance?

601
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,070
Doctors cannot cure love,
just like the flu.

602
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:12,156
The ring master said that nitwits
marry soon and the prudent never.

603
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:16,112
Unfortunately, our Albert fell
into the first category.

604
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:21,638
And we just had to help him
on his way to hell.

605
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,992
We taught him how to dance and coo,

606
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:31,556
because women like the looks and talk
more than the man's heart.

607
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:38,036
And because I know the world,
I gave me a piece of advice:

608
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:44,029
First, you have to charm her mother.

609
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:48,238
Dress rehearsal!
Albert, you're at the pharmacy.

610
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,557
Let's try a compliment.

611
01:04:53,640 --> 01:05:00,591
I am under your spell. You look young
and pretty. Prettier than...

612
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,398
- Than who?
- Than your daughter.

613
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,995
A real Casanova!

614
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,869
I hope you remember everything.

615
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,836
Don't worry.

616
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,756
- Good luck!
- Thank you!

617
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,229
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you!

618
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,071
Good luck!

619
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:48,037
And remember to kiss
the lady pharmacist's hand!

620
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,989
He acts like he's at home!

621
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:12,030
- Inn-keeper, treat him to a beer!
- I should invite the monster?

622
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,792
I'll pay.

623
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,913
Young master! A word!

624
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,400
- Why don't you join us!
- Me?

625
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,149
Cheers!

626
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,514
He's nice and tipsy already.

627
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,910
I have to go pay a visit now.

628
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,277
You wouldn't do that to us!

629
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,274
Cheers!

630
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,798
Say hello to Claire for me!

631
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,191
Claire! It's me! I'm here!

632
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:45,278
- Claire! You got a visitor!
- I... I love you!

633
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,073
The gentle young man is here,
the one who reads poems.

634
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,712
I want to hear your sweet voice.
Come to me, my angel.

635
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,509
Let's dance. One... two...

636
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:10,758
Mom, tell the drunk I never want
to see him again!

637
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,037
We've been waiting anxiously.

638
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,875
I see him!

639
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:21,194
If I weren't curious,
we would still be waiting.

640
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:32,039
After Albert was rejected,
he wanted to end his life.

641
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:37,956
It was good luck that the count
taught him to fly in the daylight too.

642
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:03,679
You studied philosophy just to
start jumping off rooftops?

643
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,479
Life is colorful and exciting!

644
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,710
Not for me it isn't!

645
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:14,199
Sadness descended on the castle
and the clouds were gathering outside.

646
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:19,356
The public prosecutor, feared by all,
was coming for a visit.

647
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,755
And nobody knew what he was up to.

648
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,592
They must not find Albert.

649
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:38,552
Mr prosecutor!
Welcome to Castle Frankenstein.

650
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:50,438
Good day! I'm Dreyfuss,
public prosecutor!

651
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:54,879
Here Professor Švajcer was
Professor Sedlmayer's best friend.

652
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:03,751
We investigated that the Professor's
brain is at this castle.

653
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:10,870
And according to the testimony
of blacksmith Hufschmied

654
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,830
it was transplanted here into
the head of a certain Albert.

655
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:26,514
Here's the search warrant.

656
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,711
- The prosecutor is at the castle.
- He won't help me.

657
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,514
He's looking for the Professor's brain.

658
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:44,829
- And where is it?
- In your head, you silly boy.

659
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:54,832
- I am a professor?
- No, but you have his brain!

660
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:00,680
- We have to hide you.
- If they find you, we all go to court.

661
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,075
I know the perfect hiding place.
No one will find you there.

662
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:11,078
- What is it all for?
- Quiet! I hear voices.

663
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,709
And what's over there?

664
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:20,952
The underground jail and
the torture chamber.

665
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,591
But here, this is a fine collection.

666
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:31,558
- We'll take a look at the jail.
- Nothing stops him.

667
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:37,118
Put your hand on your heart
and stop breathing.

668
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:41,512
Say: I want to pass through the wall
and I can do it!

669
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,036
Please.

670
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,754
Come on!

671
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:51,794
Give me your hands!
Let's try together.

672
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,873
Quick!

673
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,671
Who are you?

674
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,513
Professor, check his identity!

675
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,671
Run, Albert!

676
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:30,709
He's too big!
Sedlmayer was a lot smaller!

677
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:35,996
But we only care about the brain!

678
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,269
Dear Eugene!

679
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:45,077
- My name is Albert.
- Damn it!

680
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:54,830
Albert is not an artificial creature.
He's a member of our family!

681
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,114
You would have to prove me that!

682
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,513
I have no reason to prove my innocence.

683
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,068
I can prove it!

684
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,311
Look at his head, there's a zipper!

685
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,153
That's where they inserted
the stolen brain into his head!

686
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:25,352
That's unquestionable evidence.
Lie down, Albert.

687
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:35,314
Where is it? That's impossible,
I saw it with my own eyes!

688
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,074
Hufschmied! I'm warning you!

689
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,149
The countess can sue you!

690
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:47,793
- It's not worth my while.
- Accept my apologies.

691
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:52,479
I'm closing down the investigation.
There's no scar and no zipper.

692
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,759
How about a glass of sherry?

693
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,310
What happened to the zipper?

694
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,076
What happened to the zipper?

695
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,673
The day I saw Claire for the first time,

696
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:24,753
I knew we were destined for each other.

697
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:32,592
When she said she didn't want me
anymore, I got very scared.

698
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:42,269
You were scared about losing love,
and that made you human.

699
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:47,193
Because there is no love without fear.

700
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:52,033
The two of us could write a novel
about that, couldn't we?

701
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,113
That would be a sad book.

702
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:07,350
Poor Albert, it was all in vain.

703
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,549
I'll buy the rings and my father
will buy an automobile.

704
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:18,637
It's a four-seat vehicle.
They'll bring it on the railway.

705
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,709
May I explain to you what is
an automobile?

706
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,110
It is a...

707
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:35,433
I don't understand.
Is it something you eat?

708
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,318
- No. It's a...
- Crinoline.

709
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:43,672
Or a musical instrument?
Maybe some kind of animal.

710
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:48,356
Let me explain.
He's been learning to drive for weeks.

711
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:51,512
Do you have me for a complete idiot?

712
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,559
I saw hundreds of automobiles
in London!

713
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,477
I even drove one myself!

714
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:09,512
That picture has live eyes.
What's the secret?

715
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:15,635
And who's that on the gallows? Igor?

716
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,668
And there, that's going to be Elisabeth!

717
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,479
That's just me.

718
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,554
If you're brave, at night we can
learn some of their secrets.

719
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,593
Are you sure you're that brave?

720
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:45,070
I'm scared but I have to help Igor!

721
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,270
Wake up, Theo!
There's someone to see you.

722
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,515
You'll never discover our secret.

723
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:05,789
Igor will never have my Elisabeth.

724
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,791
Why?

725
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,274
How dare you touch Count Theodore?

726
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,999
- Watch out, Max!

727
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,788
- I'll cut you into pieces!

728
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,995
Run, Max!

729
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,713
Thanks, Sepp.

730
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:40,989
As long as I exist, there will be
no human love blooming here!

731
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:44,629
We'll see that's stronger.

732
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,475
That's easy to say.

733
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,994
I haven't found out Igor's secret yet,

734
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,914
and the engagement of Claire
and the mayor's son

735
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,994
who is smaller than me.

736
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,596
Really! Charming!

737
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,236
Poor Albert! As if he knew!

738
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,869
Why else would he set out
into the world on this very day?

739
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,794
She can no longer like me.

740
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:32,389
You have no clue about life,
you need my experiences.

741
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,877
I will wander around the world.

742
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:43,557
I don't want to meet another woman ever.

743
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,236
There was still hope.

744
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:53,273
I sent Fiery Sepp to look at the car.

745
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:58,471
For the journey, Alojz lent him
his wet coat.

746
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:07,394
Here it comes!
Mayor, your automobile is coming!

747
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:49,157
My dear lady, dear Claire,
esteemed citizens!

748
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:55,230
This is the very first automobile
in our town.

749
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:59,712
May it be the token of happiness
for this young couple!

750
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,870
Smile!

751
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:12,518
- Take me with you.
- My little teacher...

752
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:17,195
I know everything, I crossed
half the world with the circus.

753
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:24,393
And who will take care of Auntie?
Who will free Igor?

754
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,113
We have to say good-bye.

755
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,352
Wait until the morning to tell them I left.

756
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,277
Something's going on! Let's go see!

757
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,071
Hold on tight, ladies!

758
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,917
He's no good at this!

759
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:07,235
That happens when backing up.

760
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,758
Goodness, what speed!

761
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:18,753
Slow down, mom doesn't like speed.

762
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,199
What are doing? Stop!

763
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,597
That's Claire! Look!

764
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,951
Stop!

765
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,311
Quiet, woman!

766
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,868
Help! Murderers!

767
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,273
Albert! Stop, you'll get hurt!

768
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,952
- Out of my way!
- I will sue you!

769
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,791
He saved them!

770
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:35,515
Claire, you're not mad at me?

771
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:40,550
- But I'm all wet!
- You saved my life!

772
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,759
And now we have a wedding to deal with.

773
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:25,077
What wedding?!

774
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,192
Just you wait!

775
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,716
Excellent!

776
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,552
I've always liked them together.

777
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:57,319
Esteemed audience,
may I have your attention?

778
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:06,916
Dear bride, dear groom,
dear Countess, and my fellow citizens!

779
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:11,990
I stand here before you as an honest man
and an ordinary blacksmith.

780
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:17,835
All my life, I was an enemy of the castle,

781
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:23,114
but I want to set things right
and make up with you.

782
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:29,159
Quite a transformation!

783
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:37,039
As a sign of my respect, I will light
the candles on the wedding cake.

784
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,635
Friends till death parts us!

785
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:44,673
And now nostra magnifica Miriam!

786
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,795
Homer sang praises of her beauty!

787
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,430
Miriam, is that you?

788
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:14,510
The servant stood under the gallows...

789
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,358
Who let you take the cake?

790
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,152
I bought a house with a fish pond.

791
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:41,394
It's over three feet deep
and it's full of fish.

792
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:53,349
They invited the whole town,
so we came too.

793
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,234
Darling, where are you?

794
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:03,030
I can't find my brother. I'm worried
that he's up to something with a bomb.

795
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:06,556
He was here a minute ago.
Let's go find him.

796
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:14,990
Take the cake away!

797
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,517
Violin!

798
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,551
To the peace between the town
and the castle!

799
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,074
May it last forever!

800
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:33,152
From now on, we are a pair.

801
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:38,349
We were never really scared of you.

802
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:43,434
Sure, he's nice and clever.
Cheers!

803
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:49,434
I'll let him help me out
at the slaughter house.

804
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,713
He is now the Count at the castle.

805
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:57,313
- Where are you? Come have a drink!
- Sure, why not?

806
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:04,515
But come on outside!
We'll drink in the yard.

807
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:11,269
You're up to something.
Where is that bomb?

808
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:16,197
What do you mean? What bomb?

809
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,995
Go with that fiery dwarf and let me be!

810
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:24,915
Here! See? He's lost his mind!

811
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:28,595
Bombs is all he thinks about!

812
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,797
I'll take you!

813
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,917
Watch out! There's a bomb!

814
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:09,556
Disturbing me again, earthly worms?
Draw your sword, Hufschmied!

815
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,878
No!

816
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:23,115
I haven't even dreamed of such
transformation.

817
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,990
He just conquered gravity.

818
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,629
He'll be orbiting around the planet
until the end of the world.

819
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:43,077
The blacksmith's bomb destroyed
the Iron Knight.

820
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,516
These pieces are all we have left.

821
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:50,237
That's Elisabeth!
She needs help.

822
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,277
This used to be her cell!

823
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,834
- Here I am!
- Elisabeth!

824
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:13,240
- We are free after all.
- And happy.

825
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:19,077
We'll rest together.

826
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,274
I revealed their secrets.

827
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:28,839
Young Countess Elisabeth
fell in love with her servant Igor.

828
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:34,434
When a child was born to them,
they got rid of it.

829
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:42,318
For their terrible deed Theodor
had her walled in and Igor hanged.

830
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,959
The two lovers were cursed.

831
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:51,239
Only a child without parents
had the power to free them.

832
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:56,192
Are they dead or are they sleeping?

833
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:02,317
- They fell asleep.
- For how long?

834
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,914
Nobody knows. Perhaps one day
they'll wake up again.

835
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:56,518
All the arguments and fights were over.

836
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:00,953
Love, that powerful magician,
defeated evil

837
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,270
and brought peace to the castle
and all the townsfolk

838
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:09,708
and turned Albert into a man.
A husband, actually.

839
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:15,751
And I put on my vagabond shoes again

840
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,072
because life is change.

841
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,469
I'm coming with you!

842
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:28,790
To the end of the world!
And I'll buy you an automobile.

843
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:32,390
I chose the profession of a comedian,

844
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:36,474
because deep down, I never stopped
wanting to do just that.

845
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,950
Is that sherry? I stopped drinking!
The woman won't let me!

846
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:47,877
I'm not saying good-bye!
I'm coming with you!

847
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,155
Excellent! Long live Frecklenini!

848
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:52,754
The ring master welcomed me
differently this time.

849
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:56,992
With magic I learned at the castle
I am the star of the circus now.

850
01:33:57,080 --> 01:34:01,870
The people love it, they applaud me,
and I say: Watch out!

851
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:08,559
Because every one of us could be
a big or a small ghost one day.
