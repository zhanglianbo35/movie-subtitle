00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,130
a film based on Mark Twain's
“Adventures of Tom Sawyer”

2
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,260
Good morning.

3
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,650
Coming along, Apolena,
coming along?

4
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,140
How come, how come,

5
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,140
how come you're so early?

6
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,130
Why don't you keep
the schedule?

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,610
Wenceslaus! Wenceslaus! Wenceslaus!

8
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,370
How are you, Station Master?

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,660
- Same as always.
- Same as always.

10
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,860
Wenceslaus!

11
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,090
What can I do for you, Dear?

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,300
Did you tell Patočka to stop
at Doctor's?

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,770
It's Wednesday. The Doctor's day
to visit his sister.

14
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,010
For God's sake!

15
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,850
That shrew hasn't died yet?

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,060
I totally forgot.

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,580
But I did tie a knot.

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,060
Tom! Tom!

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,210
Yes, Auntie.

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,010
- Thomas!
- Yeah?

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,540
- Don't forget to say Hello!
- Yes, Auntie.

22
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,100
<i>Wherever Mark Twain traveled,</i>

23
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,700
<i>fleeing from tax collectors</i>

24
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,340
<i>and dear friends and
even dearer relatives,</i>

25
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,010
<i>they told him stories.</i>

26
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,010
<i>That's how this one must have
landed in his notebook,</i>

27
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,970
<i>because it actually happened
in our childhood</i>

28
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,690
<i>and in our little town.</i>

29
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,730
Mr. Patočka, stop!

30
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,460
- What's the matter?
- Stop.

31
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,290
- Well, what is it?
- It's Wednesday.

32
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,500
Oh, yeah, that's right.

33
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,650
Ah, the Doctor.
Good morning.

34
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,970
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

35
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,260
Climb right in.

36
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,290
Don't forget to lock up properly.

37
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,180
And open up to nobody.

38
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,530
You can rest easy, Doctor.
Everything will run smoothly.

39
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,060
- Your umbrella, Doctor.
- Thanks.

40
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,580
Good morning.

41
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,170
Off we go!

42
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,900
Guess what I got you today?

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,660
- Sugar cone.
- Thanks.

44
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,970

Tom!

65
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,770
Where can the boy be?

66
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,500
Stephen, where's Tom?

67
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,700
I don't know, Mommy.

68
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,100
Mommy!
He's in the pantry.

69
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,620
Stealing your jam.

70
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,060
- So here you are.
- I'm not really, Auntie!

71
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,500
I'm just opening the window.

72
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,180
- Pantries should be well aired.
- I'll show you well aired…

73
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,060
Wenceslaus!

74
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,940
Here I am!

75
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,770
I'm coming!

76
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,730
Tsk, tsk!

77
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,970
Wenceslaus!

78
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,100
Be right over!

79
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,220
Won't we…

80
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,410
Ow!

81
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,700
Wenceslaus!

82
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,130
Wenceslaus!

83
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,500
Wenceslaus!

84
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,460
He has to come back.

85
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,740
The teacher checks if
we have all our things.

86
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,370
Run along, then.

87
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,490
- See you, Mom.
- Bye–bye. Got your lunch?

88
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,300
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

89
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,410
Leave that, Wenceslaus,
and come here already!

90
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,810
Put up the stop sign and don't forget
the Principal's newspapers.

91
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,300
Certainly.

92
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,770
I'll wear my cape.

93
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,770
Your cape? What for?

94
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,530
It's going to rain.

95
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,970
Rain from what?
There's not a cloud in the sky.

96
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,570
Clouds pop up quickly!

97
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,530
Hold it!

98
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,660
Go.

99
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,090
I'm going.

100
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,930
- Got your lunch?
- I do, I do.

101
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,090
See you, Dear.

102
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,170
Off you go.

103
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,650
Bye–bye, bye–bye.

104
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,410
I couldn't get it.

105
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,380
Uncle…

106
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,000
- I don't know anything.
- You're great. Thanks. Bye.

107
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,110
Bye.

108
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,890
Off to school, are we?

109
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,490
Wouldn't you rather
go for a swim?

110
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,770
No.

111
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,660
Just 'cause you have
to go to school?

112
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,220
Yeah, well, yeah.

113
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,610
Aren't you going just
because of a certain girl?

114
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,010
Mind your own business, will you?
Am I minding yours?

115
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,580
Isn't that broad's name Becky?

116
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,780
If you say broad again…

117
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,290
Broad, broad, broad!

118
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,100
If you don't shut up I'll…

119
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,660
You'll what?

120
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,260
I'll tie up one hand behind my back
and lick you with the other.

121
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,330
You just try!

122
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,380
Stop making me mad
or I will!

123
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,260
- Coward!
- What did you say?

124
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,020
- Coward!
- What did you say?

125
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,450
Coward loves Cry–Baby!

126
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,090
What did you…

127
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,010
Coward loves Cry–Baby!

128
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,220
- Take that back!
- No I won't!

129
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,130
- Take it back!
- I take it back!

130
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,170
- Louder!
- I take it back!

131
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,700
You'd better!

132
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,130
Broad! Broad! Broad!

133
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,740
Cry–Baby!

134
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,180
Křapka, I see everything
even when I'm not there.

135
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,020
Go stand in the dunce corner!

136
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,660
Ah, Master Thomas!

137
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,940
Have you slept your fill?

138
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,810
Where did you get off to, Kind Sir,
for so long? Well?

139
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,050
Did your auntie's alarm clock
stop working again?

140
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,490
Or did you have to wait until she
brought buns from the bakery?

141
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,490
No, I had to settle a score
with Huck.

142
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,100
What was that? What did you do?

143
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,330
I was settling a score
with Huck.

144
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,970
And can you tell us what score?

145
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,210
Huck insulted someone.

146
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,180
Let's see.

147
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,970
Huck insults someone and
Master Thomas has to fight him.

148
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,620
Not only do you hang around
the greatest rascal in town

149
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,930
and come late to school,

150
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,020
you are so impertinent

151
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,170
you don't even bother
to make up an excuse.

152
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,490
Can you guess what
I'm going to do now?

153
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,220
Give me a beating.

154
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,530
Brilliant thinking.

155
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,580
And do you know
why I'm going to do it?

156
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,850
'Cause you're bigger than me.

157
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,620
And now go and sit
in the girl section.

158
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,700
- You're to sit with the girls!
- You…!

159
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,210
Sit beside me, Tom.

160
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,890
Does it hurt a lot?

161
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,930
No, but I can't sit,
or I wouldn't see through her.

162
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,290
A beautiful exercise book.

163
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,690
You deserve a blue card
for such good work.

164
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,580
And he who has the most
of these cards gets what?

165
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,180
Gets a book.

166
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,300
Correct. A book.
From the Inspector.

167
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,940
Next week, already.

168
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,420
I wonder who it'll be.

169
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,380
I know who it won't be, though.

170
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,490
I could name at least one for sure!

171
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,980
- What did you write down?
- Nothing!

172
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,660
- It must be something!
- Nothing interesting.

173
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,700
But I am interested, truly.

174
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,690
That stupid book from the stupid
inspector will be mine!!! Tom.

175
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,500
- You're lying.
- I'm not!

176
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,980
Want me to swear I'll get it?

177
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,020
When I do, I'll give it to you.

178
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,010
You won't stop, will you.

179
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,460
You'll just keep bothering me.

180
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,530
I won't, I won't, I won't.

181
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,940
No, no, no!

182
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,650
One corporal punishment is enough.

183
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,730
Now we'll think of something
more interesting.

184
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,650
When the others go for an after
school swim, you'll stay in

185
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,610
and work out your
favorite math exercises.

186
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,140
Could I, please, rather have
some more corporal punishment?

187
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,700
Have you worked it out?

188
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,300
No, Sir. I don't think
it can be solved…

189
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,130
Oh yes it can.

190
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,740
Try harder.

191
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,540
I have plenty of time.

192
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,180
We can stay till evening.

193
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,620
- Where did you find the ladder?
- In the bushes.

194
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,290
There's another one there.

195
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,500
Quick, before he wakes up!

196
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,490
Watch it!

197
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,250
Thomas!

198
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,370
You scoundrel!

199
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,490
Open up at once!

200
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,490
<i>Who is it?</i>

201
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,260
It's me, Principal, Sir.

202
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:34,290
That rascal must have
locked me in.

203
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,060
I was marking some
exercise books and…

204
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,900
- Calm down, dear colleague!
- I'll calm down.

205
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,980
Tom, eh?
That's him all over.

206
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,780
But the key wasn't in the lock.
On the other side, I mean.

207
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,250
I opened up with my own key.

208
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,890
- Mmm hmm! Really?
- Yeah.

209
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,420
But I swear, Principal, Sir,
that scoundrel was here.

210
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,490
He sat right here!

211
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,330
Right here!

212
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,210
Do you feel somewhat
tired lately?

213
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,330
Or, overworked?

214
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,540
No, Principal, Sir. When I catch
that rascal I'll…

215
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,980
…talk to him.

216
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,890
I know, I know.

217
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,780
Do calm down.

218
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,250
Mainly, preserve your health.

219
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,900
No sense getting worked up…

220
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,060
…over it!

221
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,490
I'll punch a hole through him!
Oh, I'll rip him up!

222
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,490
Sharpen knives and scissors!

223
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:35,130
Sharpen knives and scissors!

224
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,810
Save your voice, nobody lives
in these parts.

225
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,370
Sharpen knives!

226
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,370
Want a beating?

227
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,860
Get out of here!

228
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,370
You're wearing some odd boots!

229
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,690
Sharpen knives and scissors!

230
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,140
Sharpen scissors.

231
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,970
People's Savings Bank

232
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,460
Watch out—in the window!

233
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,820
Who was whistling?

234
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,940
Not those two rascals again?

235
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,170
I'm whistling.

236
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,050
Can't I whistle while I work?

237
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,970
Don't run with the watering can.

238
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:35,500
Walk slowly, so you water
the beds properly.

239
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,260
It seems to me that you are just
hopping around those vegetables!

240
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,170
Understand?

241
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,460
That's his own mother being so
beastly, believe it or not.

242
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,980
I'd rather have my aunt
be so beastly to me.

243
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,250
Look, Apple Strudel!

244
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,610
- Apple Strudel! See that pump?
- Yeah.

245
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,570
Go into the garden
and take over, will you?

246
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,250
When I'm done eating.

247
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,400
Stuff yourself fast, then!

248
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,620
Keep pumping till you count up
to a hundred.

249
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,290
Pump all the way to a hundred?

250
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,540
You'll get some marbles.

251
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,530
Look at that rainbow!

252
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,610
All right then.

253
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,970
…seventy–eight, seventy–nine…

254
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,410
Heavens, still pumping?

255
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,250
What are you doing here, brat?

256
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,700
Good afternoon.

257
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,610
I'm pumping up to a hundred.

258
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,690
I'm up to eighty–six.

259
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,140
- Eighty–seven, eighty–eight…
- Where's Joe?

260
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,060
Joe!

261
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,820
You rascal!

262
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,650
You wait, you'll be sorry!

263
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,020
Just wait till I catch you!

264
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,860
You're asking for it!

265
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,100
I bet our Joe's with that boy
of yours, the rapscallions.

266
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,930
- Are you speaking to me?
- Yes, to you.

267
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,850
- Meaning our Tom?
- Who else?

268
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,610
Who's the biggest rogue around?

269
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,650
Dear Mrs. Wagner, Tom is
a lively boy, I admit,

270
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,780
but I'm sure he is at home by now.

271
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,180
My boys always behave as they should.

272
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,020
No! No! No!

273
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,450
- Quiet! Quiet!
- Let me go!

274
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,490
Tom, boys!

275
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,860
Let me go!
Untie me!

276
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,540
- Silence!
- No! No! No!

277
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,780
It's burning me!

278
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,460
I'll never snitch again!
Leave me alone!

279
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,690
- Too late, little boy!
- I have to do number two!

280
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,090
If you have to die,
make it dignified!

281
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,330
No, let me go!

282
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,300
Finish the clearing tomorrow.

283
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,700
What's going on?!

284
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,250
You black–guards, you wait!

285
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,540
If I catch you here again,
your own mothers won't recognize you!

286
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,090
Some games!

287
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,580
Could have set the forest on fire.

288
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,620
Who were they?

289
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,220
They were… It was…

290
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,610
Don't you dare!

291
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,810
- Well?
- I don't know who, Mr. Nekuda.

292
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,850
- Scissors,…
- Sharpen scissors and knives!

293
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,330
…sharpen knives!

294
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,690
Sharpen scissors and knives!

295
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,930
- Sharpen…
- Greetings, Sir.

296
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,890
…scissors.

297
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,780
Some kids were messing
around the garden,

298
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,820
sniffed out one of the ladders.

299
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,010
I had to hide it again.

300
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,580
Damn it!

301
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,700
We'll have to get moving.
Greetings.

302
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,820
- See you tonight at the quarry.
- Yeah, yeah.

303
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,780
- Tell Pajdák.
- Yeah, yeah.

304
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,020
We'll never betray each other.

305
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,140
We'll always stay together.

306
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,970
- That we swear.
- That we swear!

307
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,290
That we swear!

308
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:48,340
♫ Let our banner fly. On, on, on. ♫

309
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,500
♫ Telling all the girls… ♫

310
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,930
Fire!

311
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,610
Blasted math is on fire!

312
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,580
Now I've got nothing to study from.

313
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,170
You can have mine, Tom.

314
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,410
Looks like somebody's in our way.

315
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,780
Those brats again.

316
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,820
Let's scare them off!

317
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,410
- Go on!
- Leave it to me!

318
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,940
What was that?

319
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,820
I think it's almost midnight.

320
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,420
We'd better go!

321
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,410
Hurry up!

322
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,690
Call this dynamite?

323
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,860
It's like soft soap!

324
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:30,060
Who'd guess it would get so soggy
in just a few years?

325
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,500
So.

326
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,340
That's odd.

327
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:49,420
How about drying it up?

328
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,700
Sure. On your stove!

329
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,610
We'll have to postpone it!

330
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,420
I'll go and hide.

331
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,850
Mother won't be so mad in the morning.

332
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,930
- Bye.
- Bye.

333
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,010
You rascal!

334
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,930
Is this any time to come home?

335
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,220
- Owwwwww! Mommy!
- You devilish little rascal!

336
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,650
Keep still!
I have to stay up till all hours!

337
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,620
Auntie's still up.

338
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,380
I'll sleep in the waiting room.

339
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,610
How about you?

340
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,820
I'm staying with a very nice farmer.

341
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,890
- Want to come with me?
- All right, then.

342
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,340
You naughty boy!

343
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,900
Where've you been?
Stop!

344
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,620
I've been worried to death.

345
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,810
Stay here!

346
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,780
Wenceslaus!

347
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,850
Wenceslaus!

348
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,170
Wenceslaus!

349
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,410
If you don't punish Tom this time,
I would really begin to think

350
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,770
you don't know how to raise him.

351
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,820
Here's a belt, go on!

352
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,130
I'll punish him, Dear.
And you go to bed!

353
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,370
- To bed!
- I'll punish him, Apolena.

354
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,850
- Come along!
- I've gotta see this!

355
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,610
- Where are you going?
- I'll punish him!

356
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,050
I'll punish him!

357
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,610
Great!

358
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,730
No, Uncle, please, no…!

359
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,900
That's enough, Wenceslaus!

360
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,770
Do you hear?
That hurts!

361
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:43,570
I always do things properly, Dear.

362
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,490
So it's you nesting up here at night!

363
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,580
Get out!

364
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,890
Now!
You urchin!

365
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,980
Just you try to come back!

366
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,690
I don't keep you busy enough.

367
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:40,050
I let you play on Saturdays
and you've misused my goodwill,

368
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,370
been up to no good.

369
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,810
All that is going to change.

370
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,690
Start stirring.

371
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,660
Well stir! Stir!

372
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,260
When you've whitewashed the fence,
you can go for a swim.

373
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,330
In the end, you'll find
work is fun.

374
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,060
Fun, my foot.

375
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,780
Did you say anything?

376
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,900
No, nothing.

377
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,180
Tom, have you borrowed my ladder?

378
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,900
It's disappeared.

379
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,810
And somebody borrowed Valetta's, too.

380
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,450
How could a little boy
carry away a big ladder?

381
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,020
And for what?

382
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,490
Come on, start already!

383
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,250
What if I whitewashed a half today

384
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,980
and a half next Saturday?

385
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,570
No, my little shirker.

386
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,820
And no arguments, either.

387
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,050
You can't talk me out of this now!

388
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,420
I'll have to wash
all this laundry again.

389
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,370
Tsk, tsk! Tsk, tsk!

390
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,740
You have to whitewash that fence?

391
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,090
That's hard work.

392
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,850
It's you, is it?

393
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,450
I'm going for a swim.
Are you coming?

394
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,900
No, you have to work.

395
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,660
Calling this work?

396
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,490
Well, isn't it work?

397
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,570
When did you last whitewash
a fence?

398
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,500
I've never whitewashed one.

399
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,330
I'm not surprised.

400
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,780
You can't be trusted with
a job like that.

401
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:34,250
Wenceslaus!
Make sure not to help Tom!

402
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,940
The fence is his business.

403
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,010
See, she wouldn't even entrust it
to him.

404
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,020
Let me have a try, Tom.

405
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,060
Auntie's very particular
about her fence.

406
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,210
Please.

407
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,740
Go for a swim!
Why don't you go for a swim?

408
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,100
I'll be ever so careful.

409
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,330
Let me have a go at it.

410
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,730
Auntie could look out of the window.

411
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,130
She's not looking!

412
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:06,050
I'll let you have a bite
of my apple strudel.

413
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,890
You can have it,
and a dead rat on a string.

414
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,420
Not even for a live one.

415
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,570
But if you give me
your pink “praise” card,

416
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,650
the one the teacher
gave you yesterday.

417
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:27,420
One's no good to you anyway.
It won't get you the book.

418
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,170
Or don't bother.

419
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,250
It's not worth that stupid card.

420
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,820
I'll get it!
Don't use up all the paint!

421
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,210
- Hi, Tom!
- Hi, Thomas!

422
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:00,930
Bad luck, Tom!

423
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,810
Not at all.

424
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,620
I've never been this well off.

425
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,140
But you've got to
whitewash the fence!

426
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,410
Sure!

427
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,410
We're off to conquer Castle Pockstein.

428
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,380
So what.

429
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,730
Anybody can do that.

430
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,290
And you think anyone
can't wave a brush around?

431
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,740
- Hand it over!
- Not so fast!

432
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,890
I only hand it out in exchange
for teacher's “praise” cards.

433
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,850
You have two, don't you?

434
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,620
Three, blue ones.

435
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,450
I have three too,
and a pink one.

436
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,940
Want the pink one?

437
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,170
I asked first.

438
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,970
How many planks for three blue ones?

439
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,180
Three planks.

440
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,580
Just watch!

441
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,050
How many for my pink one?

442
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,180
Five planks.

443
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,170
I've got a pink one too.

444
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,530
So you get five planks.

445
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,770
There you go, Gentlemen.

446
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,090
Good morning!

447
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,740
Good morning!

448
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,810
- Sit!
- Tom!

449
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,500
Take your hands
off the wheel, dammit!

450
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,050
Auntie!

451
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,970
Can I go and play now?

452
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,900
How much have you painted?

453
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,250
- The lot.
- I'm going to have a look.

454
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,490
- Auntie!
- Boys!

455
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,780
Into the latrine, quick!

456
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,170
Don't lie to me!

457
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,340
You know I can't bear lies.

458
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,890
I'm not lying, Auntie.

459
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,780
I gave it two coats,
to make a good job of it.

460
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,970
You see how good you can be.

461
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,340
But you don't often want to be.

462
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,250
- Look at his hands!
- What?

463
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,980
He's got no paint on him!

464
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,290
The boys did it for him.

465
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,370
And, Mommy…

466
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:06,010
Come here, Tom!

467
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,100
Show me your hands!

468
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,140
You, shame on you!
Telling tales and fibbing.

469
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,170
Good boy, Tom.
Go and play.

470
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,380
And you—home!
You'll darn socks all day.

471
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,450
- No!
- No?

472
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,450
You'll kneel on dried peas, then.

473
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,500
LADIES

474
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,730
Apolena Dear, is that you?

475
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,580
I'm not sleeping, of course I'm not.

476
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:40,130
I'm tidying up.

477
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,570
Oh, it's you.

478
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,580
It seemed… That is, I thought
that someone was knocking on the door.

479
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,930
You want to go some place?

480
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,170
Yes, to Újezd.

481
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,340
Nobody takes this train.

482
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,940
Most days it doesn't stop.

483
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,570
What do you want, then?

484
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,620
- A ticket, I expect.
- Yes.

485
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,740
Hey, Pakrčka!

486
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,660
Hello, Wenceslaus.
Here!

487
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,100
- Wait, Lad! Hey, stop!
- Stop!

488
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,300
You wave too,
he thinks we're making fun of him!

489
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,050
Stop!

490
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,810
Take it easy, Wenceslaus!

491
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,010
Off we go!

492
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,610
Mom! Behind you!

493
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,900
Scram!

494
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:39,050
What are you doing?
I'll hit you for this!

495
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,340
Come here, my baby.

496
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,450
OK, boys.

497
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,340
Where are you off to?

498
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,650
Nowhere in particular.

499
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,180
I need four more blue cards
and some pink ones,

500
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,650
to have more than Máca.

501
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:25,690
They still hand out their dumb cards?

502
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,410
Teacher thinks it's clever.

503
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,700
You think you could get that book, Tom?

504
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,570
I'll get it all right.

505
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,130
Maybe I could get some cards for you.

506
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,860
How? You've never been to school.

507
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:49,980
Yes I have! Once.

508
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,540
Do you want them or not?

509
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,650
- But that's the Principal's Office.
- That's right.

510
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,250
Who did you think has them?
The Janitor? Yeah, the Janitor!

511
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,610
Where are you, cowards?

512
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,980
Morning, Your Grace.

513
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,500
Come closer, help yourselves!

514
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,020
Four will do for me, or five.
Or I'd better take eight, or ten.

515
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,420
I'll take a few too.

516
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,220
I was never given any.

517
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:51,860
There.

518
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:55,410
Five more pink ones for you
and five more pink ones for me.

519
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,930
Isn't it great, Your Grace?

520
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:44,490
♫ Welcome. Welcome.
Welcome to us. ♫

521
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:32,290
Good.
Máca!

522
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,290
Máca!

523
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,500
- Máca!
- Máca! Máca! Máca!

524
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:01,460
- You didn't bow.
- I did bow.

525
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,570
Please, Sir…

526
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,260
One, two, three, four…

527
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,450
Down!

528
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,540
Thank you.

529
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,220
What is all this?

530
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,570
- He's asking what it means.
- What?

531
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,620
He's asking what this means!

532
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,130
Aha.
Get up, children!

533
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:34,130
As a history lesson we presented
a tableau

534
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,730
on the Conquest of Castle Pockstein.

535
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,860
Legends tell of a hidden treasure
guarded there by Philomena

536
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,010
and Fire Dog.

537
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:48,410
We left out the Fire Dog
for pedagogical reasons.

538
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,690
Excellent!

539
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,930
I thank you all.

540
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:59,730
- Now I think we can start.
- Yes, Inspector.

541
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,410
I'll do it myself.

542
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:18,010
Dear attendees, dear children.

543
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:23,540
Our most honoured guest,
Inspector Shibranyi,

544
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:28,570
has dedicated a book to the best student.

545
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,290
Personally signed…

546
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:46,850
So who has the largest number
of pink and blue cards?

547
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:52,020
So who will be the lucky owner
of this wonderful book?

548
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,610
- The other way round.
- Pardon?

549
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,500
- The book.
- Oh, sorry.

550
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:04,090
Here, please!

551
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:09,890
- Ahh, Voříšek!
Let us see how many you have.

552
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:15,300
Five blue, three pink.

553
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,730
And Máca?

554
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,090
The best boy in the class.

555
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,250
I have seven blue ones.

556
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:36,330
Yes, seven blue?
Eleven in all.

557
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,610
Does anybody have more?

558
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,340
- I do.
Twelve blue cards.

559
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,700
- No!
- And ten pink.

560
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,570
- Excellent!

561
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,770
I have that many too, Sir.

562
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:33,450
Two exemplary boys in one class!

563
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:39,900
Congratulations.

564
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:46,620
But I only have one book.

565
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:50,730
What do we do?

566
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,570
I'll show you…

567
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,090
I know what we'll do.

568
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,890
Instead of a book
they get a good beating.

569
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,410
Till they confess
how they got those cards.

570
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,850
Turn the key! Turn it!

571
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:44,210
- Bring in their parents.
- Both of them?

572
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,420
- Both.
- Right.

573
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:55,490
Boys! Boys!

574
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,090
Why cry now, they can't see you.

575
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,130
Joe, come and watch!

576
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,490
Saved!

577
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:25,100
We won't cry, they will!

578
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:36,580
- What's the hammer for?
- Well, what would a hammer be for…

579
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,300
We'll find the treasure.

580
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,210
Tapping the wall's the best way.

581
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,410
I've taken some wine,
let's have a good time.

582
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,770
Wait!
I'll get something too.

583
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:30,010
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

584
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:01,090
- Am I clever?
- Eggs, great!

585
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,610
- Am I clever?

586
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,690
- Am I clever?
- What a bite!

587
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,700
How are we today, Station Master?

588
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:33,140
Same as always.

589
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:35,450
And you?

590
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,100
- Just the same.
- I know.

591
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,730
- Get going.
- Here we go!

592
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,140
Why not leave that case here

593
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,700
and go home for a cart?

594
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,250
No, it's quite light.

595
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,220
Just some paint from Újezd.

596
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:16,810
- My compliments, Sir.
- Greetings, Sir.

597
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,260
Good afternoon.

598
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,570
Hey, Peter!

599
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,410
Come and help me with this suitcase,

600
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,780
if you're not too busy.

601
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,890
Of course I'll help you.

602
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:45,690
Naturally.

603
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,180
There.

604
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,010
Damn!

605
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,260
It's all right!

606
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:26,090
Think you're carting potatoes,
you idiot?

607
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,290
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

608
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:08,860
You call this well hidden?!

609
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,340
Let's go.

610
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,450
Hurry!

611
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,970
- Thomas!
- Pity I couldn't give you the book.

612
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,620
They're looking for you.

613
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,370
They won't find me.

614
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,930
We're going to Pockstein,
to find the treasure.

615
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,140
I'll be a rich man.

616
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,780
I want us to get engaged.

617
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,290
I'm busy right now.

618
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:52,140
It doesn't take long.

619
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:55,260
You give me a kiss
and we're engaged.

620
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,850
Somebody could see us.

621
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,100
There's nobody around.

622
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,300
What if there is?

623
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,810
I said there wasn't.

624
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:09,700
- But… Oh no!
- Oh yes.

625
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,490
- Oh no!
- Oh yes.

626
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:15,380
Close your eyes, then.

627
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,580
- Oh no!
- Oh yes!

628
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,370
- Oh no!
- Oh yes.

629
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,660
- Oh no!
- Oh yes!

630
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:25,090
Oh no, no!

631
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,130
It's better with you than with Ann.

632
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:33,020
You've been engaged to Ann?!

633
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,610
But it was no fun at all.
Honestly.

634
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,010
- I don't care for her any more.
- Liar, you do!

635
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,530
- I swear I don't!
- Don't swear!

636
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,580
- I swear!
- Don't swear!

637
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,540
Becky!

638
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,260
What's the matter?

639
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:01,650
Why are you crying?

640
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,130
A wasp stung me.

641
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:14,970
I've never got engaged.

642
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:20,610
She'd cry, and I'd have to ask her why.

643
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:25,050
- That would make me fed up.
- A boat, boys!

644
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,020
Now we're definitely buried.

645
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:34,330
They'll find the boat and our stuff
and they'll think we drowned.

646
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,930
Amen.

647
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:03,980
Unless that cry–baby
policeman's daughter

648
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,210
quacks about us going to Pockstein.

649
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,290
What did you say she does?
Quacks?

650
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:14,330
Leave it, boys!

651
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:17,130
The eggs are in you pockets!

652
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:22,610
♫ Don't stand there, come along. ♫

653
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:26,300
♫ We three are the best of the lot, ♫

654
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:28,810
♫ the pick of the bunch. ♫

655
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:36,570
♫ Don't stand there, come along. ♫

656
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:40,500
♫ We're off to find glory and riches ♫

657
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:44,490
♫ just as the story–books say. ♫

658
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,460
♫ Let our banner fly. ♫

659
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:53,090
♫ On, on, on. ♫

660
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,930
♫ Telling all the girls, ♫

661
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,100
♫ That we are sailing on. ♫

662
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,330
♫ We are sailing on! ♫

663
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:01,810
♫ He, you and I. ♫

664
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:06,850
♫ Don't stand there, come along. ♫

665
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:10,540
♫ For all the treasures in the world ♫

666
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:14,010
♫ that await us! ♫

667
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:27,450
And now we're the lords of Pockstein!

668
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,450
We are the Pocksteins!

669
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:34,730
We are the Pocksteins!

670
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:44,170
As a history lesson

671
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,140
we presented a tableau

672
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:49,210
on the Conquest of Castle Pockstein.

673
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:50,300
Legends tell…

674
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:53,130
…of a hidden treasure,
guarded there

675
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:57,450
by Philomena and the Fire Dog.

676
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:07,610
We left out the Fire Dog
for pedagogical reasons.

677
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:11,420
But we're not leaving it out.

678
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,930
The Pockstein Fire Dog.

679
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:17,770
Jose Pockstein—Hand Dripping Blood!

680
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:33,060
Tom Pockstein—Black Lightning!

681
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:07,170
I wonder why the grown–ups

682
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,530
take just a lick of wine

683
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:15,450
and are up to all sorts of things.

684
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:19,980
I don't feel a thing.

685
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,650
As if I'd drunk water.

686
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:25,810
D'you hear?

687
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,060
Snoring.

688
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:41,330
Wait, wasn't that a light?

689
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,820
Where do you see a light?

690
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:45,940
Up there.

691
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,530
Seeing white mice, too?

692
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:51,820
Whoever'd climb up here in this weather.

693
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:55,740
I saw a light.

694
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:58,330
There was nothing there.
Quickly!

695
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:02,460
- But I swear I saw a light.
- I said you couldn't have! Climb up!

696
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:06,170
- Say what you like, I saw a light!
- Yeah, right. A light!

697
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:14,930
Here's the hiding place.

698
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:19,140
Lined like a fortress,
don't worry, Boss!

699
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,370
All right.

700
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:25,450
I smell smoke.

701
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,380
Just sniff!

702
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,210
Are you a dog or what?

703
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,970
Hurry up, I want to be home!

704
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:39,450
When it starts raining
there won't be a clue.

705
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:40,860
- Finished?
- Yeah.

706
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:43,010
Come on then!

707
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:48,250
And now none of us comes here
for a week.

708
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,740
My, what a flash!

709
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:57,180
They'll be sniffing about
but we'll just see to our business.

710
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:58,940
We meet here in a week's time.

711
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:03,090
- Then we'll divvy up.
- We'll divide it up nicely!

712
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:06,370
- It's starting to pour!
Come on! Come on!

713
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:25,170
You say three kids did it?

714
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,130
Definitely not.

715
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:34,420
Three, maybe.

716
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,620
But old crooks.

717
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:41,170
They've drowned.

718
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:45,330
Our Joey has drowned!

719
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:47,730
They've drowned!

720
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:52,220
Apolena, they're dead!

721
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:58,010
Our little angels.
They found the capsized boat.

722
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,980
A white coffin, Father.

723
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,860
My idea.

724
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:38,250
If they don't find them soon
we'll give them all a funeral.

725
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,730
How can they have a funeral
if we don't find them?

726
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:42,140
A symbolic funeral.

727
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:45,450
We'll put their things
inside the coffins.

728
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:50,340
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

729
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:51,900
They still haven't found them?

730
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:53,380
Where are they searching now?

731
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,660
Under the weir.

732
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,740
Sir!

733
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,370
Poor little orphan.

734
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:24,090
That's not Tom's cap,
it's mine!

735
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:26,060
Don't begrudge a dead boy your cap!

736
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:27,810
No!

737
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:32,620
Sir!

738
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,740
A shirt.

739
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,810
That's dear Joey's.

740
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:56,210
My poor boy!

741
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,810
He's somewhere out there

742
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:03,850
with nary a shirt on.

743
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:16,820
Tom, maybe Pockstein spent

744
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:18,980
all his riches.

745
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:21,700
Maybe there's nothing here.

746
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:27,410
Who cares about a treasure,

747
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:30,130
let's go for a swing!

748
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,500
Huck!

749
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:47,140
Huck!

750
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,180
Huck!

751
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:00,580
Now you're staring, eh?

752
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:08,100
Who's that for?

753
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:13,170
Tom, we're engaged.

754
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:17,890
You don't say! And aren't you
only imagining it, maybe?

755
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:21,210
He gave me a kiss, so there.

756
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:26,410
Are you sure? Are you sure
you're not imagining it?

757
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:33,090
If you'd been engaged,
he'd have told you where he is.

758
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,010
He didn't tell you.

759
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,170
You don't know a thing.

760
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:39,620
Where is he, then?

761
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:43,340
Wouldn't you like to know!

762
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,930
Don't be so nosy!

763
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:02,370
- 2,200, 2,300, 2,400, 2,500…
- 3,020, 3,070, 3,170, 3,270…

764
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:10,820
I give up!

765
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,260
I didn't run away from home
to spend my time doing addition.

766
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:15,220
Now you've mixed me up!

767
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,580
How much did I say?

768
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,970
How much did I say?

769
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,780
Asking me?

770
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:27,490
Let's just share out anyhow.

771
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:31,540
I don't care if I get
a thousand more or less.

772
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,500
Me neither.

773
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:39,980
One blue pack for me,
one for you, one for Joe.

774
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:43,570
One big one for me,
one for you, one for Joe.

775
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,700
One old man for you,
one for Huck, one for me.

776
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,980
You know what
I don't get, boys…

777
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:55,500
Pockstein used the same money we do.

778
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,500
Just the same.

779
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,500
Oh my!

780
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:13,060
…our beloved boys,
with whom we all lived

781
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:15,260
in love and friendship.

782
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:18,010
They were part of our lives.

783
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:24,420
We lose so much by their departure.

784
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:27,620
All the more painful the loss,

785
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:30,610
they were our most talented

786
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:34,250
and most diligent pupils.

787
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:39,850
We were proud of them.

788
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:50,490
Our pride and joy, our example.

789
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:56,530
Never shall we forget

790
01:18:56,940 --> 01:19:01,380
our three noble, splendid boys.

791
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:03,380
He's making me cry!

792
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:05,580
- I'll clap!
- No!

793
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:10,090
Look at the girls!
What are they wearing?

794
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:12,170
Wedding gowns or something.

795
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:14,250
I like it.

796
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:19,300
In the spring of their lives

797
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:24,220
they have left us.

798
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:29,460
Forever.

799
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:36,980
Tommy!

800
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:39,740
- Me?
- It's them!

801
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,330
And they're alive!

802
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:57,410
Thomas!
My poor little boy!

803
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:01,020
Tommy!

804
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:08,010
Joey, my little angel,

805
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:11,140
you've come back to me!

806
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,420
Joey! Joey!

807
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,450
- What is that there?
- Money.

808
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:30,220
- What money?
- From that savings bank!

809
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:37,050
They stole it?
Boys?

810
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:39,500
Wait! Wait! Wait!

811
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,620
Get lost!

812
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:43,460
How did you come to this?

813
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:45,050
We found it.

814
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:48,290
It's eight hundred thousand.
We counted it.

815
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:50,290
Found it? Where?

816
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:52,450
We found it,

817
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:55,530
and if we tell you where

818
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,900
do we get a reward?

819
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:01,210
Of course you do.

820
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,540
Even though we're minors?

821
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:08,060
I'll see to it that you do.

822
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:10,260
Quickly, where?

823
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:25,610
Hold!

824
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:33,610
Get going, fast!

825
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,140
Get ahead of them!

826
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:56,050
We frightened them off.

827
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:00,340
I know who this belongs to.

828
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:25,970
I didn't kill him!

829
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:29,540
Who did?

830
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:31,260
Ležátka.

831
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:33,930
He thought the fool had taken the money.

832
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:37,250
That he came earlier and he just
stashed it away.

833
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,740
We didn't know those brats found it.

834
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:48,690
The chicken was delicious.

835
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:50,610
Apolena made a dish of paprika.

836
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:53,130
- And you stuffed your belly.
- That's right.

837
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:54,730
Off you go.

838
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:57,730
- Be well, Wenceslaus.
- You too.

839
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:01,780
Wenceslaus!

840
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:05,060
Wenceslaus!

841
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:07,770
Did you tell Patočka to stop
at the Doctor's?

842
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:11,490
- The Doctor's sister leaves today.
- I totally forgot.

843
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,610
But I did tie a knot.

844
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,140
Tom!

845
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,500
- Yes, Auntie.

846
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:31,500
- Thomas!
- Yeah?

847
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:35,020
- Don't forget to say Hello.
- Yes, Auntie.

848
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:47,170
- Mr. Patočka!
- What is it?

849
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:50,540
- Stop!
- What for?

850
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:52,980
- It's Wednesday.
- What?

851
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:56,050
- It's Wednesday.
- Oh yeah, Wednesday!

852
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,610
Ah, the Doctor.

853
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:01,420
Good morning!
My Dear.

854
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,060
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

855
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:04,730
Good morning.

856
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:07,020
Climb right in!

857
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:10,140
'Morning.

858
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:13,250
Don't forget to lock up properly.

859
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,970
And open up to nobody.

860
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:18,420
You can rest easy, Doctor.

861
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,090
Good morning.

862
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:21,610
This is the boy who drowned.

863
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:24,060
The basket, Doctor!

864
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:26,410
Thank you.

865
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:29,090
I have some chocolate for you today.

866
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,170
Thank you.

867
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,980
- Why don't we go?!
- Off we go!

868
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:13,980
- See you, then.
- See you, Tom.

869
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:39,410
Who throws stuff at people
taking a quiet nap?!

870
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:28,780
THE END
