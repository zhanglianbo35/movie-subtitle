Take your hat of.
Sit down over there.

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,280
Take your boots off.

19

<i>In the evening,
In the evening, she came...{\i\i}</i>

20
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,960
Come.

This film was made according to
actual events which took place in 1984

22
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,460
- Can you wee on your own?
- What?

23
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,280
- Can you wee without help?
- Yes.

24
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,060
You can do it over there.
Come on, go pee.

25
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,980
Come. I'll show you.

26
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,480
You will sleep well.

27
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,260
Lie down, do you understand me?
Lie down. Like this.

28
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,660
Lie down. Close your eyes,
Close your eyes.

29
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,040
Lie down and sleep.
Do you understand? Close your eyes.

30
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,300
- What do you want?

31
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,160
- You'll stay here with us.

32
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,680
No. I am here only for tonight.

33
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,820
- So you're not here for long?
- Sure, not for a long.

34
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,440
- Quiet! Be quiet!
You should be sleeping!

35
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,200
- She is right, we have to sleep,
we have to sleep.

36
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,560
You are going to stay here.

37
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,080
For sure...

38
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,520
- I'd become an idiot as the rest.

39
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,800
Marika Farova, born in 1970.

40
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,020
Her mother died when she was 4.

41
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,600
Lived together with her father,

42
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,420
who in winter 1983 brutally ...

43
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Come here.

44
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,340
Be quiet now, don't make noises. Put
your hands behind you. Do you hear?

45
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,600
We're waiting for breakfast.

46
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,600
Don't get dirty Prackova,
don't play with the jam.

47
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,880
Don't pick your nose!

48
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,820
- New one.

49
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,700
Please, don't play with the jam.
Behave!

50
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,580
Why are you murmuring! Eat!
Say thanks, shut up and eat!

51
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,580


52
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,900
- There are only rolls?

53
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,380
Take that in your hand!...

54
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,120
- Will there be any proper food?

55
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,860
...with your hand and eat, eat.
Jesus Maria.

56
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,440
Come on, quicker, quicker!
Walk faster, faster!

57
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,980
Up, down, up, down.

58
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,820
Everyone is doing the same.

59
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,400
One, two. One, two.

60
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,220
Down, up. One, two.

61
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:05,000
Get up, get up!  Quickly!

62
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,820
One, two, one, two!

63
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:19,080
Up, down. One, two, one,
two, one, two.

64
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,220
Keep up with the rhythm.

65
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,840
Can you hear, can you hear!?

66
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,560
I won't act like a clown!

67
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,740
- You will do as the others, and
I won't dispute with a moron.

68
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,740
- To hell with you!

69
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,420
One. Two.

70
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,380
Good.

71
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,080
Put your clothes on.

72
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,400
Sit.

73
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,420
What does this remind you of?

74
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,520
- A butterfly.

75
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,240
- A butterfly, good.

76
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,640
And this?

77
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,740
- I don't know,
maybe a bird with ears.

78
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,000
- A bird with ears,
that's very good.

79
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,400
And this one?

80
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,340
- Fire.

81
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,780
- So they're right, well done.

82
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,780
And this is your file.

83
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,320
If you won't stay in your room,
you won't get better.

84
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,880
No?

85
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
- But there is something bad going on,
can't you hear?

86
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,220
- There is an ill girl in there.

87
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,520
I'm always looking out for everyone.

88
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,280
And if you slept like last night,
you wouldn't hear anything.

89
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,340
- How does this open? Maybe she fell
off the bed, or maybe she is thirsty.

90
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,240
- Go to sleep Maricka,
you mustn't listen to this.

91
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,980
If you're kind girl,
you'd be liked here.

92
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,380
- Good night.

93
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,220
- And if you can't sleep,
you can count sheep.

94
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,420
When I was little,
I would count them every night.

95
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,860
First sheep walked over the bridge.

96
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,800
Second sheep walked over the bridge.

97
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,560
Third sheep walked over the bridge.

98
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,720
Get in your place!

99
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,260
Well, you see?
You're a proper girl.

100
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,160
Looks like you'd like this?

101
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,480
No?

102
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,560
You need to breath it in.

103
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,320
You made clowns out of yourself,

104
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,640
all by yourself.

105
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,520
Look closely, keep working.

106
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:42,060
Lenin, Lenin you fool.
I've told you ''Lenin''

107
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,800
This will go first ...

108
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,380
Come on. Empty it here.

109
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,200
Let's go.

110
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,320
Did you draw this?

111
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,580
It's pretty.

112
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,760
Why did you draw a door-handle?

113
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,980
Open it, come with us!

114
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,840
Please pick up those tools.

115
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,120
And soon we'll go
to clean up ourselves.

116
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,000
Give me.

117
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,240
Wear this.

118
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,880
<i>A princess lost her beads
when she was at the ball.{\i}</i>

119
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,140
And such a neck...

120
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,140
<i>A princess lost her beads
when she was at the ball.{\i}</i>

121
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,000
<i>Her father, a powerful king,
called Honzik.{\i}</i>

122
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,040
<i>You're called Honzik
Find the beads for us!{\i}</i>

123
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,080
<i>...There aren't any bigger ones
You ate them on Sunday.{\i}</i>

124
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,660
Quiet! It's evening!

125
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,660
It smells here, like...

126
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,680
Show me.
What do you have there?

127
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,740
What did you put on?

128
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,380
Take it off. Surely, you can't wear it!
Where it is! Where is the clasp!

129
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,820
Who has helped you put this on!
Where is it for god's sake!

130
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,760
Show me! You could get hurt!
Do you think it's safe!

131
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,360
Give it!

132
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,900
<i>A princess at the ball,
lost her beads.{\i}</i>

133
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,880
Here you are, eat this.

134
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,160
You will calm down.

135
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,160
It will make you feel better.

136
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,000
Marika.

137
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,020
I am sad.

138
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,840
- Come...

139
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,900
- Thank you.

140
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,200


141
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,320
Is there a phone here?

142
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,080
A phone?

143
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,320
That thing you put in your hand.

144
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,140
You talk to it.

145
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
You can hear someone in it.

146
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,940
- Who?
- The one you call.

147
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,800
- Who?
- Quiet, quiet! I need to sleep!

148
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,340
- It's safe, come.

149
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,820
Good evening.

150
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,120
- What are you doing here?

151
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,580
What are you doing here?

152
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,580


153
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,820
Quiet, quiet!

154
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,960
Quiet, be quiet!

155
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,900
Be quiet! Be quiet!

156
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,260
Wait, wait!

157
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,860
Wait!

158
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,240
This burns.
- Yes, it's strong.

159
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,840
You come here for what, exactly?

160
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,020
And I don't know how you will
explain that you wanted to

161
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,160
sneak in to the bar.

162
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,780
I needed to go to the bar
to clean my hand.

163
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,700
Otherwise I'd need to spend
the night untreated.

164
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,760
That's bad. -
- Gently.

165
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,820
Let's not forget about him.

166
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,880
- There are things to be done
that don't require supervision.

167
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,860
- You know that girl?

168
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,440
- Are you ready, girls?

169
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,820
Go to sleep.

170
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,760
- I need to make a phone call.

171
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,780
- Who do you want to call?

172
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,740
- An adviser in Hradec.

173
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,440
- Well, the phone is over there.
If only they pick up.

174
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,500
- This is an internal phone,
it can't be used to call outside.

175
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,760
If I can't call,
I will talk to Procházková.

176
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,460
What did you just do?

177
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,320
Did you hear me?

178
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,920
What did you do?

179
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,340
- We're doing all we can
with what is happening here.

180
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,060
We don't want any publicity

181
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,440
And these, psychiatric drugs!
Are being misused.

182
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:38,580
We used this many all last summer!

183
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,060
- You think we don't
know that, Doctor?

184
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,760
Just so it is clear.

185
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,820
Someone with authority,
who is in charge,

186
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,420
can decide what medicine
to give to which patient.

187
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,260
When there is a new chief,
they can do it their way.

188
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,860
Everything sucks.

189
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,080
- This is a big mistake, lady.

190
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,500
You can't just create here
any regime you wish!

191
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,820
And you don't dare to
use drugs as a punishment!

192
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,280
Understand - these are sedatives!

193
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,780
- No way. Only those inmates
who are on your list

194
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,760
are subjected to (punishment) showers.

195
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,880
- 2 years ago there was
only 4 girls, on that list,

196
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,920
and now there are 35 of them!

197
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,700
- It increases.
What am I supposed to do.

198
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,040
Ask that governess, I am not
responsible for everything here.

199
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,060
And in the punishment-record
you write whatever you want.

200
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,540
- If you punish one in a week.
I said, in a week,

201
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,700
another one in 3 weeks, and
don't tell us how to treat them!

202
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,980
- You, Francisek.

203
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,140
I have a test here,

204
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,860
completed by one of your girls.

205
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,540
I put it in here not a long ago.

206
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,800
- You know, we never
treat anyone carelessly.

207
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,420
- For example, if some girl has
serious problems & nothing works? Eh?

208
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,120
- Stay well Francisek.

209
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,700
- So everything is fine, yes?

210
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,520
Come in, Jíra  come, come, come.

211
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,700
Look, what a deal! I exchanged one
Aero car for this wonderful buggy.

212
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,740
It is 2300 model from 1984.

213
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,400
look at these lights!
I was chasing it for 10 years.

214
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,780
- Good afternoon.

215
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,620
- What are you doing here?
What do you want?

216
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,480
Did someone send you, or what?

217
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,920
- I came here so you could...

218
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,700
I'm watching people here and I don't
belong...If you could examine my case

219
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,060
I am Marika Farova.
- What? - Farova.

220
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,120
Farova Marika, well, I don't know...

221
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:34,420
Yes, you've been placed in this institution,

222
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,240
because you've been abused,
there's a date.

223
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
Jesus Christ!

224
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,940
Who has sent you?
- I came by myself,

225
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,900
because I am not like
the other girls here...

226
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,980
Johanka, are you there?
Yes, so come, here, quick!

227
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,400
You should look after your pupils better

228
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,500
one is just standing in front of me.

229
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,480
you'll do like this

230
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,940
If you sin, if you do something wrong,

231
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,640
you need to be punished.

232
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,260
Please, like this.

233
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,000
Wait.

234
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,940
I know that you're different.

235
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,000
Look, her hands are tied up.
- Yes.

236
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,440
I will help you.

237
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,420
Johana?
Where are you supposed to be?

238
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,600
And who are you supposed to obey?

239
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,880
Your tutors, us, or your friends?

240
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,440
You will have to be punished,
yes?

241
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,240
- What will you do to her?
- She will get a lesson.

242
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,740
- Help me.
- Me?

243
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,060
- You won't help me?

244
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,160
- Come on, what are you waiting for.

245
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,260
Sit down

246
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,340
shoes come off, like this

247
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,520
legs on the top

248
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,440
like this

249
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,300
let's take off that hair clip

250
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,820
now sleep

251
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,300
Good night.

252
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,280
Get up, you can make a call.

253
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,120
That's because you kept quiet,

254
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,100
today she gave us the keys,
- Why?

255
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,120
She usually calls her mate in US
- And tonight she will not?

256
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,260
- Maybe as an patient.

257
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,360


258
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,740
Like this.

259
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:02,560
Hello, is that Hradec?
I am Farova Marika.

260
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,880
I'm calling because I was supposed to go
to you but I am in the Shanci Institute

261
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,580
I was supposed to be with
you, under social care...

262
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,120
I know that it's late...

263
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,560
But this is not right...
- Wait, be quiet!

264
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,060
Wait.
- What's going on?

265
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,800
- Prohazkova! - Who?
- hurry up! - Wait!

266
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,180
You, hurry!

267
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,440
Wine!

268
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:44,240
Let's celebrate, let's drink!

269
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,060
- Mrs. Prohazkova, today I can't.

270
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,800
- Oh come on, I am a cool girl

271
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:56,300
I'd like some more

272
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,680
What are those keys?
Who do you need to call?

273
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:09,380
Complain?

274
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,600
- Well, I wanted to call already
in the morning about Farova,

275
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,480
as you weren't here.

276
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:20,780
I took the papers

277
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,060
I will do it now.

278
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:31,760
I'm a cool girl.

279
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,320
What a prick.

280
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,740
- Boss, where did you
learn English so well?

281
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,100
- We're sorry, don't be angry,
we needed to make a phone call

282
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,120
The phone is locked away,
apparently every penny counts,

283
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,080
but it's perfectly fine to
call US, that's just great.

284
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,660
- Very good, isn't it.
- Yes it is.

285
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,780
- But how come that you have
such a tomcat only for yourself

286
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,460
such a nice rooster, on the bed...

287
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:47,400
You've hid yourself from me
there? Come out!

288
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,600
Farova, come out.

289
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,520
You can have a good bye
drink with me

290
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,460
- I didn't want to...- Don't worry.
- Thanks, - Thanks.

291
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,840
Lets celebrate!

292
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,460
Enough!

293
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,100
Well... Marika...

294
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,400
You have a rather vivid imagination.

295
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,960
The social institutions aren't
haunted castles after all.

296
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,540
- But she says that they're
weird things happening.

297
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,900
- There are all of these,
various idiot children.

298
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,480
- How can you talk in this way
about your friends?

299
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,680
I've checked here and no
Farova is mentioned.

300
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,480
- But how come? - None.
- I have to be on the list.

301
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,740
- Maybe they forgot about you.

302
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,440
- You know what, girls, go to
your room, and then after dinner

303
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:00,960
we will see. Yes?
- Thank you. - Bye. - Good bye.

304
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,660
Hair up. - Yes. Here.

305
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,340
Like this.

306
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,780
Do you like it? - Yes.
- You know what.

307
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,360
You can have this.
- Thank you.

308
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,180
And what is this for?
- This? That Spray?

309
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,000
Wait!

310
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:52,120
- I never believed in anything
she said. Bye.Thanks.

311
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,900
We're looking for a girl

312
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,940
- Go upstairs, then left.

313
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,840
Get in.

314
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,380
- Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?

315
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,360
It would be nice if you could
tell me where we're going.

316
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,740
- They're looking for you.

317
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,100
- But I am not going back there!
I am not going back!

318
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,300
Stop the car! Stop or I will
jump! I will jump out!

319
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,720
- What are you doing! What are
you doing! Close the door!

320
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,560
You almost killed us.

321
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,200
- Pity.

322
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,880
- Have a seat.

323
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,960
Miss!
- Yes?

324
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,600
Bring us two tonics, please.

325
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,820
- Yes.
And coffee for your young lady?

326
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,220
- For my young lady?
- Yes.

327
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,000
- Sure. Vienna coffee, right, honey?

328
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,440
You know what I think?
That you're acting up a little bit.

329
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,900
If it was really as bad as you say,
it would be known to everyone already

330
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,240
or everyone would say what you do.

331
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,520
- That's not true. Not the same
things happen to everyone there.

332
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,760
- Do you know what Krocova
did once? She...

333
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,500
Better finish it.

334
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,000
Wait here.

335
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,560
Let's go, I still have some things to do.
- Where?

336
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,880
- To meet a friend, come.

337
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,440
I'll just pay.

338
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,800
I'd like to pay. Can I have
these chocolates as well.

339
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,720
Thanks, bye.

340
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,840
Where is this.

341
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,680
You're a pig.

342
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:05,040
- I changed my mind, I realized
that this is better for everyone.

343
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,920
- You mean better for you.

344
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,680
- But listen, if you don't provoke,
nobody will punish you.

345
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,620
You have to go back,
you don't have a choice.

346
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,320
And what would I do with you?

347
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,280
They'd lock me up.

348
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,440
There you have
a comfortable space to live.

349
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,640
They're responsible for you.
Not me.

350
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,700
Do you understand?
You can't do anything about it.

351
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,020
Here. I will write you
down my work number.

352
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,000
And if something happens,
give me a ring, yes?

353
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,360
Come.

354
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:45,040
Everything will go well. And if
something comes up, call me.

355
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,540
You will get used to it.

356
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,800
Wait, I almost forgot!

357
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,440
Give it to them as a gift.

358
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,640
Give it to some teacher,
you will know which one...

359
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,640
They'll take it, you'll see.
- Ok, bye.

360
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,560
Good luck.

361
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,900
Take care.

362
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,880
We need to solve this in a good
and a positive way, not like it

363
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,600
happened in Viechove...

364
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:10,060
Ms. Prohazkova couldn't keep
her authority over her patients,

365
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:16,420
but on the other hand, she had
a different approach to every girl

366
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:21,240
and we need to design and
establish one approach for everyone.

367
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,100
For example Miss Farova...
- Marika?

368
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:29,040
She needs to be handled
in some special way.

369
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:34,760
Ms. Sukova, think about it and
write down in the punishment - list.

370
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,760
- This is illogical.

371
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:41,800
We can't punish Miss Farova
just because we'd like to.

372
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,880
She made an effort.
She came back.

373
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,000
And we must forgive her,
it's our duty.

374
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:52,720
And in terms of your
educational punishments...

375
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,320
- Our punishments?

376
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,900
- We are all responsible for
the order here. - No?

377
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,060
- And Farova is here temporarily.

378
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,260
- I know, but she will be treated
exactly like the other girls.

379
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,080
I think that covers it.
Thank you all.

380
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:19,040
I'm sorry that I ran away,
I brought you a gift.

381
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,500
- Beg me.

382
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,680


383
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,420
Come on, have one.

384
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:46,440
Better that we have it anyway.

385
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,840
Go on, don't be afraid.

386
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,620
Thanks.

387
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:23,300
I got it from that gorgeous prince,

388
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,080
in a great castle,

389
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,240
everywhere was just chocolate.

390
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:33,500
and with that prince, under his spell

391
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,760
and this was my first...

392
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,060
Farova, what is going on here.

393
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,180
Don't you know that sweets
are forbidden in rooms?

394
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,960
What are you doing!

395
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,360
Show it to me.

396
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,600
Show it to me!

397
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,940
You're a pig.
Clean yourself up.

398
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,840
Can you hear me?

399
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,160
- No...

400
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,900
- No?!

401
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,560
Just you wait you fucking shithead.

402
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,380
Close the tap.

403
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,800
Holy Jesus! It's Mrs. Sukova.

404
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,920
I mistook her for a patient.

405
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,360
Look at them now,

406
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,520
Anyone who eats sweets,
won't have dinner.

407
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,480
- Eat.
You've already been punished.

408
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,720
Let's go, hurry up.
Come on, quick, quick.

409
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,600
One, two, get down, one two!

410
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,440
Run, run, properly! One, two!

411
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,880
Hit the ground with your foot,
one, two...

412
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,980
- Please, can you talk to Viktor?
He said he'd call somewhere

413
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,280
to transfer me from here...

414
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,720
- Look, I was in a big mess because
of you, try to talk to Volfova,

415
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,620
she decides about it now.
Not Viky, he is only a waiter.

416
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,000
- What I am supposed to do
if I can't write or call anyone.

417
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,400
- You should be glad that we got you
from Hradec, do you understand?

418
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:34,660
If cops brought you here, you'd be
locked in a cage for a month, right?

419
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,800
Don't you know where
you're supposed to be?

420
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,800
What you're supposed to be doing?

421
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,640
- So here you have those two girls,
Ms. Krocova.

422
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,560
You think that you
can do as you wish?

423
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,560
I keep my eye on you.

424
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,780
Let me go!

425
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,460
She has a seizure !

426
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,980
Let me go!

427
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,200
I'd like to see what you've
injected her with.

428
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,980
We couldn't find it.

429
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:36,620
She made such a mess here.

430
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,120
- How long has she been tied up.

431
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,740
It's four hours since she
had the seizure.

432
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,440
- What is this from?
-Can't you recognize a bruise?

433
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,700
- Farova is one of the worst
behaved patients here.

434
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,240
And we need to get through it.
You know it doctor.

435
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:07,920
- It is stated in the Social Act that,

436
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:13,160
every occurrence of physical
force must be noted down.

437
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:18,640
It must be contained in the patient's
personal file! Did you do it?!

438
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,300
- These things, it's always our fault!

439
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,300
Why don't you take her home!

440
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,960
They're not our children!

441
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,200
If you ever have to deal with them,

442
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:34,400
You'll see what it's like.
- Where are you going?

443
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,540
Are you going to
leave her like this?

444
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,280
She needs to move now.

445
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,120
Who is this?

446
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,800
It's me, Marika.

447
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,960
Please. Please, come,
I can't take it anymore.

448
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,680
I really don't know what
to do anymore. Please.

449
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,980
- Tomorrow evening.
- Tomorrow evening? - Yes.

450
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,340
- I will be waiting.

451
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,960
I'll show you something.
- Go on.

452
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:27,120
I'll do it prettily.

453
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,460
How do I look?

454
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,760
Very delicate.

455
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,260
Hide it among your things.

456
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,640
I'll hide it.

457
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,460
Bye.
- Bye.

458
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,320
I just... a little, little bit...

459
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:09,720
Show it to me.
Show me, don't be afraid.

460
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,320
Pretty.

461
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,660
Who taught you this?

462
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:26,700
- I found it. I just... I found it.

463
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,340
- Now you need to be locked up...

464
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,960
Won't you tell me?

465
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,760
It is mine!

466
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,100
It's my make up!

467
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,740
Hello!

468
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:04,180
Wait.

469
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:09,960
Is Zdena here? - No.
- That's good. Very good.

470
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,920
You called, so I am here.

471
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:18,860
- What are you looking for?

472
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,820
I look like a pig.

473
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,820
Wait a moment,
I need to wash this off.

474
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,860
So what's up.
- Aren't you afraid of them?

475
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:45,380
- Afraid of whom? Those here?
You think I am afraid of them?

476
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,220
That's a good joke.
- Wait.

477
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,960
I only trust you.

478
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,800
I want to give you a note,
a very important one, read it.

479
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,640
- You have such sad eyes.

480
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,560
What are my eyes like?

481
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:08,640
- Like water.
- Water?

482
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:13,360
- Were you surprised when I came today?
- No.

483
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,840
I believed you when you said
that you will come.

484
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,280
- You believed me.

485
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,680
You're a golden girl.

486
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,360
You're so beautiful.

487
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,940
If you were older...

488
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,520
Someone's here!

489
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,940
Our Farova has a young man here.

490
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,160
Let's admire her.

491
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,960
- Good evening.

492
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,280
- What are you doing here?

493
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,480
Do you have something to do, here?

494
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,140
Is that what you really like Viktor?

495
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:01,160
Marika is one of the most severely
ill girls in this institution.

496
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,660
- That's not true, not true!
Don't believe her. She is a moron.

497
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,040
It's her! She is not normal!
- Wait.

498
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,160
- I came to see Zdena.

499
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,860
- Zdena is not here.
She had a morning duty.

500
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:15,640
- Come Viktor.  I will see you
out to the front door.

501
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,280
- So... bye!

502
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,100
That Marika, it wasn't her fault...

503
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,260
I got in by the window.
It is my own trick, you see.

504
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,260
- Well, you know...

505
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:34,420
- I guess it's difficult to recognize
if someone is a nut-case. Or not.

506
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:38,300
For example they call me
a loon since my childhood.

507
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,320
- What did she talk about with you?
She must've said plenty of nonsense.

508
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:45,080
- Who? That girl?

509
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:48,820
- She said some stuff,
like she does not like it here, etc.

510
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,740
One cannot trust everything...
Right?

511
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:55,080
- Did she ask you for any favors?

512
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,660
- No...
Well, to take a note to her family.

513
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:03,180
- Do you have it?
- No, she didn't give it to me.

514
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,000
Where is that note.

515
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,480
- Hands.

516
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,680
It's mine! No, no!

517
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,280
I always new that she's dangerous.

518
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,080
Come.

519
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,800
Come.

520
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,600
What is this bruise?

521
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,860
You need to be strong.

522
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:44,920
The evil gets punished in the end.
Always.

523
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:51,240
You need to trust your gut.
You need to believe in yourself.

524
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:54,260
And you have to know that
there is a higher power

525
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,180
that can see us at all times.

526
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:59,520
- What are you doing here?
Don't you know?

527
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:04,720
It's forbidden to be near her
without the doctor's permission.

528
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:08,520
This is a violation of discipline.
Get lost! Quickly.

529
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,280
I am telling you to stop.

530
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,460
I've seen many things here

531
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:18,220
but now, I've had enough.

532
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,840
You know that.

533
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,340
You will have an opportunity
to say what you want.

534
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,560
- Farova doesn't belong here.
You should be praying that

535
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:28,240
this girl never starts talking...

536
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:31,420
What kind of staff do you have.
Without qualifications!

537
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,600
Tht's why the mortality rate is so
high! And you're responsible!

538
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,480
- Enough!

539
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:39,920
- I'll demand Marika's adoption.

540
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:44,520
You know well that Marika never has
been stripped of her legal rights.

541
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:48,440
And I will make a complaint about you.

542
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,440
- Very well Ms. Sukova.

543
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:58,300
You're still here?

544
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:01,000
- Where are Farova's papers?
- I don't know.

545
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,060
But here is a letter.

546
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,300
-What letter?

547
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:08,700
- From the district methodical center,

548
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,940
that if we want to transfer her to
a normal children's home in Hradec,

549
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,420
we have to write some expert opinion.

550
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,960
Do you know her?
Is it a difficult case?

551
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,220
- Quite. Show me.
I will take care of this.

552
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,300
And where are you going, Mirek?

553
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:26,960
Oh... To Madrid. Imagine...

554
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:31,060
To the conference about institutions
for disabled/handicapped youths.

555
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,300
I will even hold a speech there.

556
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,220
That is something, right?

557
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,800
Social institute in Sanci here,
how can I help you?

558
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,700
Yes, yes.

559
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:48,580
- What is going on?

560
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,860
What is happening?
- I don't know!

561
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:55,820
- Quickly. Quickly! Hurry up,
make sure everything is in order...

562
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,700
Hide all the...

563
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:25,000
Oh this is here...
Good Afternoon.

564
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:27,080
- Ms Sukova. Is she here?

565
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,720
- Yes, it's me.

566
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:32,300
- Security police.
Please come with us.

567
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:21,640
Next.

568
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,240
What do we do here?

569
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:30,960
What is this!

570
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,780
Let's go, quickly!

571
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,960
Quiet. It's better if we go.

572
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,140
Marika, do you hear me!?
Open up!

573
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:39,120
It's good that nothing has
happened yet! But hurry up!

574
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,360
Marika, listen,

575
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:51,320
open the door so we can talk,
you don't need to be afraid,

576
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:55,000
Open up nicely and
then we will see, yes?

577
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:58,720
We will go away, yes?

578
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,380
Marika? yes?

579
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:10,720
Open the door and
you'll go to bed.

580
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,740
Open up by yourself, yes?
We'll be far away.

581
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:21,180
Where are you?

582
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,720
- I am here!

583
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:30,460
I am here, you heard me!

584
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:33,120
And the girls are here as well!

585
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:35,980
Come here, come here!

586
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,420
Vera, Vera!

587
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:41,440
Wait here! Stand here
and don't do anything!

588
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,160
Come quickly!
- What is happening!

589
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:00,400
You need to get out of here
or you'll die. Understand?!

590
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,780
Come on, come on!

591
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:14,820
Looks like it's everyone here!
- Wait! Not everyone!

592
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,860
There's still someone upstairs!

593
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:20,580
We need to wait for everyone!

594
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:27,880
Johanha, dear, please.
Stay here and don't go anywhere.

595
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,900
Understand? Stay here, yes?

596
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,360
Be careful!

597
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,540
Why don't you go there?

598
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:14,760
So why did you come here?
There's still people there.

599
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,960
- Can't you see the bars in the window?
- The keys are in the cupboard!

600
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:21,140
It is possible to get there!
- Go then if you're an idiot!

601
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,940
Don't go there! Come down!

602
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,680
Don't risk your life for these morons.

603
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:32,800
They won't get better anyway.

604
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:36,500
There are various kinds of them
upstairs, aren't there.

605
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,460
- What did you say?

606
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:48,860
You idiot, they're screaming!
Can't you hear!?

607
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:52,720
Do you hear me?!
Let's go upstairs!

608
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,800
Let's go!

609
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:56,860
During the fire of the institute
in 1984, 26 patients died.

610
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:01,600
In the judicial report teachers
Volfova and Prochazkova were

611
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:06,660
sentenced to 1 year in prison
as punishment for their abusive

612
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:10,780
handling of patients.
Teacher Krocova was given 9 months,

613
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:15,520
with the conditional suspension.
Marika Farova was convicted of

614
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:19,320
arson and imprisoned
for 5 years without parole.

615
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,040
Starring:
