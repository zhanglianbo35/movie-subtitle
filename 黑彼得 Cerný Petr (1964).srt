They played it this morning.
- This morning?

22
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,830
Yes at 5.15 when
we're leaving for work.

23
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,876
It was so nice.
- Come on, play it once more.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,959
They play it when we're asleep

25
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,509
or when we're out...

26
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,193
Where is my comb?
Where did I put it?

27
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,638
Don't come here boss we're changing.

28
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,672
I've seen hundreds of bodies
like yours!

29
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,156
Not like mine!
- He's used to his fancy bit.

30
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,239
She's got a big arse.
- And he's got a big gut!

31
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,432
But that's all I've got left!

32
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,076
Listen, there's a new trainee
starting today, so watch your language

33
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,439
in front of him!
I know your big mouths!

34
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,314
What do you take us for, boss.

35
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,072
Has anyone seen this trainee, girls?
- No. - I wonder what he looks like.

36
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,158
I bet he's just a kid! He's only 16
if he is an apprentice.

37
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,430
Nothing for us then.

38
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,069
Don't worry Peter,
you'll soon learn, don't worry.

39
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,758
We are a self-service store.

40
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,031
I'll tell you exactly how it works.

41
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,673
We have complete faith
in our customers,

42
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,678
we do believe them, in 100%,
you know.

43
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,352
But of course some of them will still
from time to time steal something.

44
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,950
Your job will be to keep an eye
on our customers,

45
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,355
and have your wits about you.

46
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,234
But they can't know
that you are watching.

47
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,870
They mustrt know
you're watching them.

48
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,913
Nothing wrong in that!

49
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,874
You're just preventing
those customers from stealing.

50
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,551
We're simply educating them!

51
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,158
Look Peter, I've never caught anyone

52
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,193
while wearing a white coat...

53
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,915
If the customer sees that coat,
he knows you're part of the collective,

54
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,395
so he's careful... he's careful.

55
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,390
But without the coat
you'd catch one or two magpies.

56
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,511
May I put it here?
- Of course you can, Peter.

57
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,437
Understand, Peter?

58
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,869
So, okay.
- Yes.

59
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,393
Peter, like I said already,
this is not the way to do it.

60
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,116
You're tailing these people
like a cop. You peek in their bags.

61
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,552
They are not going to put anything
they steal on top.

62
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,434
Easy does it and be inconspicuous,
do you understand?

63
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,154
I do.
- So try it once again.

64
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,916
Excuse me, I had a feeling that
the man has just stolen something.

65
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,076
Which one?
- He's outside already.

66
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,237
So run after him, hurry up.
- But I'm not sure that he has...

67
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,954
It doesn't matter, go on.

68
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,149
Where have you been?

69
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,511
Where have you been?
- At work.

70
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,517
At work?
- Yes.

71
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,517
I really was at work.

72
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,312
Where?

73
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,115
At the shop, where else...

74
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,232
Do you know your boss?
- Of course.

75
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,511
So what was he doing here,
looking for you?

76
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,708
I guess he doesn't know you then.

77
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,038
Of course he does but something
happened. - What?

78
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,119
I had the feeling one man
stole something.

79
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,073
So I followed him.

80
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,034
I see... You were being a detective.

81
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,194
So you thought he'd stolen something.
So what did you do?

82
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,198
Then I followed him around.

83
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,715
And that was all?
- Yeah.

84
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,992
What was the point of following
him around?

85
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,030
Did you identify him?
Did you see what he took?

86
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,313
No I didn't. And what would you've
done? I just followed him.

87
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,558
What would I've done?
I'd call somebody.

88
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,190
To stop and identify the man.
And search him.

89
00:14:53,320 --> 00:15:00,351
But just to follow him around
that makes no sense!

90
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,839
I tought he'd give himself away.

91
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,874
But how.
Why didn't you get his name?

92
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,518
You can't do that.
- Why not?

93
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:18,795
I'd call a policeman or someone older
and get his name.

94
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,948
You had the feeling he'd shoplifted.
- Yeah, but I wasrt sure.

95
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,755
Then you should have stayed
in the shop.

96
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,153
I couldn't.
I told about to our women

97
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,075
and they said to follow him.
So I did.

98
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,716
Why didn't you tell your boss?
What's the point to tell some women.

99
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,149
I mean the sales ladies.
- I see.

100
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,037
So what was the final consequence,
the final result?

101
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,790
Nothing.
I just followed him all day.

102
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,833
You followed him.
So you werert at work?

103
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,878
But I was.
- Just for a while.

104
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,949
And what did you do after that?

105
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,357
So tell me. Just answer.

106
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,431
I went home.

107
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,519
Did you? So, you went home.
A bit early!

108
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,751
Werert you supposed to go back?

109
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,919
Why home?
How you dare?

110
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,797
Or do you think everybody can

111
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,708
just up and leave his job
and go home?

112
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,598
There were many things
in my life I didn't like.

113
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,033
But I had to face them,
often against my will.

114
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,717
That's what made a man out of me.
That was that!

115
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,116
Come on, Dad, let it be.
Peter is still a kid.

116
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,154
I'm not some little kid.

117
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,638
Of course not! And you should have
realized that a long time ago!

118
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,593
Here, let me warm it up for you.
- Forget it.

119
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,712
But it's cold.
- It's alright.

120
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,991
It's not!
Warm it up.

121
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,435
If you look around
these shops nowadays,

122
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,198
what do you see?
Nothing but women.

123
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,948
No men...
they're as rare as goldust.

124
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,111
And in the end, what are the women
good for?

125
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,075
They get married

126
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,560
and the workplace is empty.

127
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,918
So who does it all depend on?
Who stayed then?

128
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,632
Men!

129
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,552
Men.

130
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,472
Put up with it for a year or two...

131
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,675
and then you'll be the boss.

132
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,920
You know what that means?

133
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,760
You'll be somebody!

134
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:00,310
It's just up to you...
to become that boss early!

135
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,392
God forbid
there wont' be another war.

136
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,750
As the saying goes...

137
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,714
Stay near the food
to keep far from the grave.

138
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,555
But don't think about that.

139
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,394
Don't think about that at all.

140
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,512
Look.

141
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,678
On Monday, you'll go back to work

142
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,076
and apologize and everything
will be allright.

143
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,191
Understand?

144
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,190
Do you understand?

145
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,238
When we were twenty
you wanted my love

146
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,835
I was getting married
but you went to the army.

147
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:44,032
When we were twenty
you wanted my love

148
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,555
I was getting married...

149
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,915
...or if there was a fire at least.

150
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,315
So you could go and put it out.

151
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,996
No, they've got plenty
of firemen already.

152
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,880
Don't look at me.

153
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,992
See, I'd just be saving lives
if the fire was at night.

154
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,519
At night?

155
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,599
We'd haul the women
out of their beds!

156
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,792
Oh, yeah!
- Sure!

157
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,714
Lmagine the flames
licking Pavla.

158
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,155
Lucky flames.

159
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,873
See, now I pushed out
all the air.

160
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,355
All the air pushed out.

161
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,631
But if my chest is up like this...

162
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,033
It's like you expect what a girl
wants to say...

163
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,273
and she's just got her breasts
like this...

164
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,631
How are Pavla's breasts?

165
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,352
I don't know.

166
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,835
Only Mara knows, huh.

167
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,796
I don't know why she's
going out with him.

168
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,469
He thinks he's so cool,
but he's a bad influence on her.

169
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,592
I met them for many times walking
by the river.

170
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,750
They go... she goes...
I'm standing there looking at her

171
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,838
and she doesn't even glance at me.

172
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,711
I get the feeling I am not there.

173
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,752
But you are, you are.
- I know.

174
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,838
You are a virgin.
- Yeah, yeah.

175
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,475
Tell me, oh lovely maiden...

176
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,595
A little higher!
- Why do you laugh?

177
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,190
Not everybody can sing like you.
Do you know that?

178
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,438
It's a parody of Othello.
- Yeah.

179
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,111
Now he leaves... Wait a minute,
then she tells him:

180
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,076
My sweet Othello, I love you so.

181
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,829
Oh, my sweet Othello, I do love you.

182
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,715
I declare my love for you!
- I can't hear you. Louder!

183
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,629
Oh, my sweet Othello,
I love you so.

184
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,515
Now Casio comes in...
- What? Who?

185
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,791
You never saw it?
- No, did you?

186
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,832
I did.
Wait, so he says:

187
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,278
Good evening, my lovely lady,
sorry to disturb you.

188
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,231
Othello is to report
to court immediately...

189
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,712
Othello is to come immediately...

190
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,238
cause two guards are fighting
over their posts.

191
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:43,154
And he says goodbye to her and leaves.
Now Casio is alone with her...

192
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,797
and he says... I can't remember
what he says, though.

193
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,198
Listen.
- What?

194
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,075
That isn't a very good song.
- Wait a little. How does it go?

195
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,356
Peter!
Is Peter here?

196
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,595
Is he not here?

197
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,069
Peter! Seems he is not here.
And it goes on.

198
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:14,277
Your husband, my lady,
is a great hero,

199
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,311
and he loves you faithfully...

200
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,352
What are you looking at?

201
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,439
I'm not looking, I'm thinking.
- About what?

202
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,114
I can't tell you.
- Why not?

203
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,795
You'd think
I had a dirty mind.

204
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,388
I already know that!
- What?

205
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,875
Not really.

206
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,595
What are you thinking about?

207
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,870
I really can't say.

208
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,151
I know it anyway.
- So say it.

209
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,753
I can't.
- Come on, say it.

210
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,236
Actually, there's nothing dirty
about that, you know.

211
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,511
Some girls wear swimsuits
even tinier than mine.

212
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,235
And some little girls
walk around totally naked.

213
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,511
True, but only the little ones.
- Yeah.

214
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,273
I really hate the girls
who show-off and then...

215
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,589
Come on, row! Go ahead and row!
- I am rowing! - I can't see!

216
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,909
Those girls are in my class.
- What about those guys?

217
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,600
I don't know them.
- Some bums...

218
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,594
Get lost!
This is not a show.

219
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,675
Her hair was all locks
and curls...

220
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,078
No! That's wrong.

221
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,352
Her hair was all she ever thought about.
- Stop, I beg you!

222
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,914
Don't' beg me.
- It's like this...

223
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,238
Her hair was all locks
and curls...

224
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,675
When she stood by...
But sing it all.

225
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,110
...by a window...

226
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,552
Her hair was all locks
and curls...

227
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,434
She didn't think about anything else.
So, do sing.

228
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,472
What are you looking at?
- The grass.

229
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,237
Why the grass?
- Green colour soothes the eyes.

230
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,595
That's why the cows are so calm?

231
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,117
Sorry... I didn't mean it that way.
- You bull.

232
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,638
Look, those boys are staring at us.
- So let them.

233
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,354
If I were them, I'd never run around
in my boxers.

234
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,153
You can't help the way you look.

235
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,279
Could you go out with them?

236
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,358
Not really...
- Why?

237
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,550
They're kind of weird.

238
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,592
That's what I think too.

239
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,871
And anyway, I don't know them.

240
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,836
Do you know me?
- They're coming over here.

241
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,318
Just let them.
So do you know me?

242
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,868
Look, they're coming
and still staring.

243
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,230
It doesn't matter.
So do you know me?

244
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,920
Well, yeah, I do.

245
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,794
What are you doing tonight?
- I don't know yet.

246
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,115
I would go out.
Would you go with me?

247
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,357
Hey you, get up!
- Didrt you hear?

248
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,038
Get up!
- Why?

249
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,752
I said get up!
- Why? I don't want to.

250
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,552
But we want to!
- Do you want a bloody nose!

251
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,272
Do you want a bloody nose!
- Why?

252
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,392
Do you want a bloody nose!
- Why? What's your problem?

253
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,233
What you mean?
- What the hell were you

254
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,035
staring at us before. Like idiots.

255
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,754
Just take a look at yourselves,
guys. You're white as babies!

256
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,030
What the hell you mean?

257
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,954
That's normal! We're bricklayers.
- All bricklayers look like this.

258
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,150
I knew you were bricklayers,
but the girls don't care

259
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,590
for creamy legs.
- Watch you don't have creamy face!

260
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,676
I still think you look like bums.

261
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,109
Bums can hit back hard.

262
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,676
You're not going to hit a girl,
are you?

263
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,916
Don't be so sure!

264
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,235
I don't believe it. I saw you
with your girlfriends earlier.

265
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,635
Those werert our girlfriends.

266
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,838
We don't give a damn about them!

267
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,393
I didn't do it on purpose, honest.

268
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,078
I was just about
to put one on him.

269
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,749
Believe me, please.
- Screw you!

270
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,394
So what we were talking about?

271
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,397
I don't remember.

272
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,829
How come?

273
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,516
I just don't.
- So will you come out tonight?

274
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,920
She's sitting there, staring.

275
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,074
Watch this!

276
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,192
Are you watching me?
Are you?

277
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,554
Hello.
Hello!

278
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,471
Where are you looking?
I told you to look at me.

279
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,556
Why don't you look at me?
- What's up?

280
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,639
I said, look at me!
- Where are you going?

281
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,995
Can I, please?

282
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,595
Thank you, thank you.

283
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,870
Thank you, thank you very much.

284
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,318
Hey, did you see it?
- Yeah, I saw it.

285
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,398
Good, eh?

286
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,592
Hello! Hello!

287
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,110
Who is it?
- That guy from the beach.

288
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,595
Hello.
- Let's go.

289
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,080
Where are you going?

290
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,030
Where are you going?

291
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,995
Over there.
- Where?

292
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,357
Let's dance.
- It's so crowded.

293
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,032
So what. Come on!
- Arert you thirsty?

294
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,469
I'm not.
- I am, I'll get a lemonade.

295
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,354
Hey, you! Wait! I said hello!

296
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,355
I said hello, too.

297
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,634
Yeah, but how. Look, I...
Wait, wait! You stay out of this!

298
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,235
Wait, I'll show you the difference!
- Leave her alone!

299
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,999
HELLO!
You said: 'ello...

300
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,669
Do you hear the difference?
HELLO! 'ello...

301
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,631
What a nut!
- Don't you hear it?

302
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,955
You're crazy.
- Hello.

303
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,596
Stop it. Let's go.
- Do you hear that? Hello!

304
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,433
It has no sence, let's go.
- Hello!

305
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,240
Hello.
- Hello!

306
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,920
Let's go! Please!

307
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,236
Can I have this dance?

308
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,716
But they're not playing.
- They don't.

309
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,793
So I'll come back.

310
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,068
Hello, Pavla.
- Hello.

311
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,760
Shall we dance?

312
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,549
I don't want to dance with you,
Mr. Mara.

313
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,956
What are you doing here then?
- Waiting for a lemonade.

314
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,039
And who's getting it for you?
- I've got to go now.

315
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,750
Hey, you! Come here!
Have you got it now?

316
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,189
What? - Is that clear?
- What you want again?

317
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,791
Is that clear? - Please, take it.
- You wait. Just listen.

318
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,554
Hello.
- Let's go please!

319
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,594
What you want?
- Wait! Hello!

320
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,915
Hello.
- It's not the same. Hello!

321
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,554
Hello.
- Hello!

322
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,240
Hello!
- Hello!

323
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,714
Hello!

324
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,717
Good evening, boss.

325
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,635
That's wonderful, really.
- It's not like that. It's just...

326
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,035
If I were your dad, I'd push that
cigarette... down your throat.

327
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,434
You shouldn't be smoking, kid!

328
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,110
What's up with him?

329
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,799
What did you do to him?
- Why should I do anything to him.

330
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,876
Don't lie!
- I didn't do anything to him.

331
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,468
I am his best apprentice!
What did you do?

332
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,194
Nothing.
- What did you do?

333
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,471
Nothing I swear.
- Wait, wait!

334
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,956
You don't believe me.
Don't you believe I am the best?

335
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,476
Zdenek! Zdenek!

336
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,033
I do believe you.
- Zdenek!

337
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,718
I really do believe.

338
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,879
Wait, wait!
Come here, come over here.

339
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,709
Come here and tell them.
- What's the matter?

340
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,229
Just tell them.
- Tell them what?

341
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,430
What the boss said.
- About what?

342
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,836
About what... about me.
- That you are drunk.

343
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,952
He said that?
- He did.

344
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,435
No, he didn't!
He didn't say that!

345
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,313
Let's go!
- He didn't say that.

346
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,758
You couldn't loan me twenty?
- What for?

347
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,474
Don't worry, I'll give it back.
- When will you give it back?

348
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,160
Shortly... believe me.

349
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,431
Don't do it!
- Don't worry, don't worry.

350
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,956
But I want it back.

351
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,834
Yeah, sure, sure... don't worry.
Let's go, Zdenek.

352
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,833
Look, that bricklayer
spilled our drinks.

353
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,599
Who cares, let's dance.
I'm not thirsty anyway.

354
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,349
I'll get us new ones.
Don't you mind? I'm going.

355
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,391
Don't let her get away!
- I won't!

356
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,273
Look!
- Miss, Miss!

357
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,196
Look!

358
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,951
I've got it arranged with her,
do not worry.

359
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,598
Watch me.

360
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,030
Hey, you.
- Hello!

361
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,593
Hello!

362
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,516
Hello! Shall we dance?
- Hello.

363
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,354
Where is he?
- Well, since you spilled our drinks,

364
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,114
he had to get some more.

365
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,598
Well, yeah, I know...
You're right.

366
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:48,032
So when he comes back, tell him...
No, nothing. You watch me.

367
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,357
And you watch me as well.

368
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,473
And when he gets back,
tell him to watch me too!

369
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,438
Does he always drink so much?
- He doesn't.

370
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,397
I can see he's drunk.

371
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,636
It's because he likes a girl here.

372
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,320
Does he? And which one?
- She is already left.

373
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,194
Is that why he got drunk?
- No, he got drunk before.

374
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,356
But why? - Because he was going
to tell her tonight.

375
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,235
I see. And did he?
- I said she already left.

376
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,516
I know that, but before?
- Before he wasrt drunk yet.

377
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,189
Does he have to get drunk for it?

378
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,470
You'd have to know him.

379
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,559
And aren't you pals?
Why didn't you tell her for him?

380
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,036
I can't. I had hepatitis.

381
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,395
Hepatitis, did you?
You guys are so weird...

382
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,630
She's weird...
she even doesn't know him.

383
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,228
She could have asked me and I'd have
told her why he got drunk!

384
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,751
So what would you say?
- How great he is!

385
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,272
Great?
- Boss let him build a corner already.

386
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,039
A corner?
- Yeah.

387
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,310
You mean a toy one.
- No, a corner with two walls.

388
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,715
With two walls.
- Made of stone.

389
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,195
Yes, with two walls, well.

390
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,198
I'm sorry to tell you,
if it was me

391
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,993
and he was drunk,
I'd ignore him too.

392
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,759
Okay, let's go.
- Where?

393
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,236
Let's dance.
- Okay, let's do it.

394
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,519
You watch me, do watch me!

395
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,791
Hello, hello!
- Hey, what's up.

396
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,752
Wait!

397
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,312
Will you dance with me?
- Show me!

398
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,318
Hey, Zdenek, come here!

399
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,309
You didn't see her, did you?

400
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,151
Who?
- The one wearing the blue...

401
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,431
She was sitting at the table...
Did you see her?

402
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,229
Boss, did you by any chance see

403
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,794
a girl in blue pass by here?

404
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,878
You've got a girlfriend already?
- Not me, him.

405
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,472
Cenda!

406
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,073
Cenda!

407
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,759
Let's go! She's already gone.

408
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,559
Look, do you know what?

409
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,516
To hell with her.

410
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,995
She's dumb.

411
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,709
So, did you find her yet
you two Romeos?

412
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,595
What are you staring at?

413
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,589
Boss, do you think that I'm ugly?

414
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,151
My dear, don't ask me.
You must ask the girl.

415
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,678
But I'd like to hear it
from you, boss.

416
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,398
Go home and sleep it off.

417
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,790
Okay.

418
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:26,669
But are you still proud of me?
- Right now, not really.

419
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,715
I know, I know...

420
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,630
But how are you proud of me
other times...

421
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,798
Don't bother me,
and go home to bed.

422
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:47,710
Okay, I'll just sit down here
for a moment, boss.

423
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,190
Look, Cenda,

424
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,393
I like patting you on the back,
when you deserve it,

425
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,990
but you must understand,
no-one can praise you all the time,

426
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,873
over and over again...

427
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,794
I am sure you understand that.
It's sure thing...

428
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,193
Cenda...
- Let him be.

429
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,793
This is the best for him.

430
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,311
Good evening, mum.
- Hello, darling.

431
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,791
Come here, what's this stain?

432
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,836
Just have a look.

433
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,072
It seems there are more stains...

434
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,158
You should take care of it.
It's your new suit.

435
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,397
Are you hungry?
- No, I'm not.

436
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,714
I can warm up the leftovers
from lunch. - No.

437
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,234
Well, tell me something.
How was it there?

438
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,598
Nice.

439
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,638
Which boys did you go with?

440
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,114
There was a crowd of us.

441
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,880
And were the boys fine?

442
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,831
Not some hooligans, I hope.
- No.

443
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,960
And were the girls there too?

444
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,035
So have you found yourself
a girl yet?

445
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,192
No, you haven't. It's good.
You've still got plenty of time.

446
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,749
And what do you boys drink?
- Just a lemonade.

447
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,034
Do you?
- Really, nothing else.

448
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,071
Don't tell me
you don't take a beer.

449
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,674
Who did you walk home with?

450
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,514
Some other boys or alone?
- Alone.

451
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,470
And the boys stayed there?

452
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,390
Are you deaf?

453
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,555
Mum asked you something.

454
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,475
I had a lemonade,

455
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,240
then we danced,

456
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,395
then I came home.

457
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,715
Nothing happened.

458
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,076
Good night.

459
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,751
Wait, wait.

460
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,269
Look at this.

461
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,320
It's quite interesting.

462
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:40,678
It's about a boy like you.

463
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,790
They don't give him a name,

464
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,276
that's not done anymore...

465
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,556
But...

466
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,709
But it's all true.

467
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,675
You can read it yourself.
It's something like...

468
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:08,794
You're a man now, so you'll
work it all out. Just read it!

469
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,352
I know it.
I read it already. Good night.

470
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,233
"What every boy should know
about his body"

471
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:26,436
What are you doing, dear?
- Chopping noodles.

472
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,996
They're here already.
What are you going to tell him?

473
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,475
What should I say?

474
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,349
Call him. So, call him.

475
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,116
Franta!

476
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,200
What do you want?
- Come here.

477
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,239
What do you want?
- Will you come here!

478
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,796
You come here.

479
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,674
Go there. So, you go.

480
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,716
What is it?

481
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,560
Nobody else should hear this.

482
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,870
What do you have there?

483
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,755
Some paintings.

484
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,629
So unwrap them.
- They're for the shop.

485
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:56,073
What's on them?
- Maybe Jan Hus or Jan Zizka.

486
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,152
I told you this is for the shop.
- I see.

487
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,354
What was on Saturday?
- I got a bit drunk.

488
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,200
Bullshit.
- It's true.

489
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,719
And what about her?
- Mara was there and...

490
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,197
And what?
- I got a date with her for today.

491
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,152
What time did you get home?
- At about eleven.

492
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,432
And what did you do?
- What... all kinds of things.

493
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:42,517
And the tongue is a problem, eh?
- Well, yeah.

494
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:47,676
Don't tell me you two kissed.
- I've got a date with her today.

495
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,432
What about the sell-by date
on these?

496
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,830
I hope they're still allright.
- And these oils here?

497
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,351
They have three more weeks to go.

498
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,870
Good. And these?
- This is the latest delivery.

499
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,992
These should be completely fresh.
- Yes.

500
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,759
And they actually are.
- Good, it's good.

501
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,988
Peter, what are you doing?
Get the stuff in and shut the door!

502
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,952
Now the cooking fats.
- They are all fresh.

503
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:24,073
That's the last delivery, it's fresh.
- Thank you. That's okay.

504
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:30,116
I've seen them. Now the rum.
- Two, four... sixteen, eighteen bottles.

505
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,196
It says twenty one here.

506
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,756
That's yesterday's count.
So we've sold three since then.

507
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,792
Here we've got
the five-star brand.

508
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,708
What are you doing!
Don't be lazy! Don't cut that rope!

509
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,400
Untie it! We can always use rope!

510
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,511
So how many five-stars?

511
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,200
Two, four, six.
- Yes, six, that's fine.

512
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,676
And the pure spirits.
- Two, four, six, eight, ten.

513
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,718
Ten, yes.

514
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:03,198
Boss, please...
- That's fine, Peter, that's fine.

515
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,716
Paintings, paintings!
The toilet is blocked,

516
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,195
our stepladder is busted,
the fan hasn't worked for years.

517
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,278
Cognac.
- Two, four, six, eight.

518
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,759
Eight, that's right.
And rums?

519
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,118
Three, six, nine... thirty.
- Thirty one!

520
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,435
So we've sold one since yesterday.

521
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:31,272
Boss!
- Well, that's good, Peter.

522
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,038
Bitter herb.
- Two, four, six... nine.

523
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,118
Yes. Here we have...

524
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,470
The five-star cognac.
- From Georgia!

525
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,831
Two, four, six.
- So six.

526
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,677
A painting has to be viewed
from the distance.

527
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,951
I don't have the right glasses...

528
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:08,831
Good lord, it's beautiful.
Look at her eyes, they're closed.

529
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,313
But she knows what she's doing.

530
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,717
Make a little funnel,

531
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,400
so those bottles stop
distracting you.

532
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,720
Look at where she has that hand!

533
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:31,597
No, no, that's perfectly normal.

534
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,953
Look at the kid, look at him.

535
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:39,676
Save a little bit for tomorrow!
What are you looking at?

536
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,992
If the women could go
shopping naked,

537
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,952
our hiring troubles would be over.

538
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:49,231
And you know it's a serious problem.

539
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,989
You can count the boys willing
to work in a shop on your fingers.

540
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,351
They all want to be
astronauts, engineers...

541
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,713
And when we do get a man in here,
he's surly defective.

542
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,517
Let's go on to the wine.
- All right.

543
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,312
So here is the Sylvaner green.

544
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,273
Two, four, six... ten.
- Agreed.

545
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,916
Then Mostar. Three, six,
nine... eighteen.

546
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,756
That's right.

547
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:49,438
What did you have in the can't
near the train station today?

548
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,195
I was carrying some paintings.

549
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,077
What you mean?

550
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:06,239
What paintings?
- For the boss.

551
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:15,277
You see, for the boss, paintings.

552
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,312
Who can buy paintings nowadays?
- Come on, Dad...

553
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,757
They were not really paintings.
They were more like prints...

554
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:40,072
Prints, prints.
- It was a reward from headquarters.

555
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:45,359
You see, a reward.
- Well, reward.

556
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,112
What was on those paintings?

557
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:08,750
I did ask you a question.
Answer me.

558
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:13,028
Awoman.
- Awoman...

559
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,995
What kind of a woman?

560
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,588
Damn it, answer me.
I asked you a question.

561
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,952
I have to pry every word out of you.

562
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,830
Completely naked.

563
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,359
Peter!

564
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,040
Aha, naked.

565
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,511
You see, dear. They all talk about
socialism and then

566
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,189
they use our boy to deliver filth!
You should talk to them.

567
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:50,629
My God! What's so horrible
about seeing a naked woman?

568
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,389
After all, he is a big boy now,
he can see things like that.

569
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,671
You should be ashamed.
And you too.

570
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:04,917
You're saying it was obscene.
Actually she was a thousand times

571
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,996
prettier than the one we have.

572
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:11,632
Don't be impudent.

573
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,391
Take a look.

574
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,870
Just take a look.

575
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:30,239
Look at her eyes.
That's what I call beauty!

576
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,836
You walk this way,
she's following you.

577
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,149
Walk that way,
she's following you again.

578
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,672
What a beauty!

579
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,558
I'd like to see somebody
paint like that these days!

580
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,949
It's all scribbling, now.

581
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,992
Goodbye.

582
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,195
Isn't Pavla going out with Mara?

583
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,470
She used to...

584
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,750
Hello.
- Hello.

585
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,400
So say something.
- Like what?

586
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:14,395
Well, something.
- Nothing comes to mind right now...

587
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:19,277
What were you looking at? Let me see.
- It's just a poster.

588
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,194
Let me see it.
- It isn't a poster really.

589
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,515
What it was?
- It's more like a painting.

590
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,870
So let me see it.
- I can't.

591
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,231
Just let me see.
- I really can't. Where shall we go?

592
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,950
Okay so keep it.
- Where shall we go?

593
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,036
Nowhere.

594
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,595
So, here it is.

595
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,716
You've got it upside down.

596
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:01,472
Where did you get it?

597
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,870
In our shop.

598
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,078
Why is it so crumpled? Shame.

599
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,240
Because I had it in my pocket.

600
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,360
How old do you think she is?

601
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,189
It's hard to say with women.
I mean with paintings.

602
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,117
She's definitely older than nine.
- That's for sure.

603
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:34,070
It's nice.
Shame it's crumpled.

604
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,796
I'd really love it if you could

605
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:02,032
find time again tomorrow.

606
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,633
But when I get home now
my Mum will be angry

607
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,309
of me being late,
and I won't even be able

608
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,469
to ask her.
- I know just what you mean.

609
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,793
You can't imagine the hell
I go through at home.

610
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,275
Why?
- Well, just a hell.

611
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,552
My Mum constantly

612
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,830
wants me to tell her everything.

613
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,440
She even says I don't love her.

614
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,309
I do, but if I tell her that,

615
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,750
she starts all over again.

616
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,198
And Dad says
I'll be the death of her...

617
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,949
And she is so naive.

618
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:53,309
Just imagine I say I'm going
to the beach

619
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,638
and she says: Please, darling,
don't drown there.

620
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,632
That's really horrible.

621
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,320
Or I come home and she has visitors

622
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,678
and, even before I walk in,

623
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,195
she's yelling at me:

624
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:11,552
Sonny, say hello to everybody!

625
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,638
It's like I don't know how to behave.

626
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:18,469
Or she tells me I like
other people more than her.

627
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,831
Like who?
- Like my friend Lada, for example.

628
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,159
I must leave, you can tell me
some other time, okay?

629
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,836
Then you'll come tomorrow.
- I don't know yet.

630
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,873
I'll be there anyway, just in case.
- Bye now.

631
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,752
Bye.

632
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,190
Peter!

633
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,277
My Mum wants to know
if they have gherkins at your shop.

634
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,156
Thanks. See you!

635
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,600
What is it?

636
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,871
What are you doing?

637
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,436
You're just standing there and...
It's embarrassing.

638
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,630
You're gaping like a dummy.

639
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:18,156
I'm just doing my job.
- You call this working?

640
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,309
I've been watching you
and it's not a pretty sight.

641
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:26,116
Doing what?
- Well, I'm here watching.

642
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:30,074
That's not work!
Just to stand and watch.

643
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,195
What are you watching?
- The people, obviously.

644
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:38,314
Obviously, but why?
- So they don't steal something.

645
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:43,309
That's all right, then.
Keep your eyes open.

646
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:49,275
Sadly, there are still people
with sticky fingers around here.

647
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,793
Boss!
- That's correct, really.

648
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,753
Boss!
- What is it, Peter?

649
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,872
He's back, he's here again.
- And who?

650
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,152
Well, the one that I was chasing
and he got away.

651
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:44,434
Call me later, please. A bit later,
will you?

652
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,356
Just wait a little.

653
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,956
Wait.

654
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,710
Has anything happened?

655
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,439
Nothing.
Some woman stole something.

656
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,959
What? Awoman?

657
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,636
What did she steal?

658
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:31,193
Some sweets, or something.

659
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,353
Nothing much.

660
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,429
Worth about how much?

661
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,559
Twelve crowns maybe.
It was not more.

662
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,760
Did you go after her?

663
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,070
I did not.

664
01:13:55,200 --> 01:14:00,752
So what did you do then?

665
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,276
Nothing.

666
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,356
You didn't even follow her outside?
- No.

667
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:21,629
You didn't follow her.

668
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:28,638
Listen, didn't you have
any problem?

669
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,440
At work? Or with your boss?

670
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,113
Arert you hiding anything from me?

671
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,636
No, not at all.

672
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,275
Tell me the truth.

673
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:48,389
I can still smooth it over.

674
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,753
No, really. Believe me.

675
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,152
You shouldn't have just let her go.

676
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,675
I ask you for the last time,

677
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,790
did you have any problem at work?

678
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,275
I swear I didn't.

679
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,713
So it's all right then,

680
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,519
isnt' it?
Everything is okay.

681
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,312
Just okay.

682
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,070
Look,

683
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:48,674
if it ever happens again,

684
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:53,999
grab the guy by the neck
and shake him

685
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,600
till it all drops out!

686
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,959
When I was watching you there,
you were looking good!

687
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:10,629
Mother, he did look good!

688
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,200
No, I didn't.

689
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:27,077
Well, how could you, standing there
like a scarecrow.

690
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,916
You couldn't.

691
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,952
Wait.

692
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,955
I've got it now.
You're bored.

693
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,036
I'am not.

694
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,756
You're bored!

695
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,350
I know what interests you.

696
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,516
I saw it the other day.

697
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,200
Short time ago.

698
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,349
Afew kids like you,

699
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,436
kicking up a racket!

700
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:26,998
An offense to decent people!

701
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,394
Yeah, up! Yeah, across!

702
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:37,429
They call it "corkscrew"!

703
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,956
When you were born

704
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,358
we were happy to have a boy.

705
01:17:55,240 --> 01:18:00,189
You grew,
I bought you a violin.

706
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,150
It's on the top of a wardrobe.

707
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,430
I bought you an accordion.

708
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,350
It's inside a wardrobe.

709
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:23,432
You stormed in with a guitar.

710
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:27,553
It's all the rage, it's easy.

711
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,715
Just sing a little,

712
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:36,871
and you're happy.

713
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,911
But you can't make a living out of it!

714
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,556
You can't.

715
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,830
What do you want to do?

716
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:59,390
What do you want to do?

717
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:04,233
Tell me.
What do you want to do?

718
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,113
I don't know.

719
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,992
So, you don't know.

720
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,636
Interesting!

721
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,075
You know
what you don't want to do.

722
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,835
But you don't know
what you want to do.

723
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,509
I thought you liked that job much.

724
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,871
And now you don't.

725
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,958
Don't interrupt.
You don't understand.

726
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,115
How dare you talk
to your mother like that!

727
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,790
What a behaviour?!

728
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,718
Come in.

729
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,918
Come in!

730
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,838
So, come in!

731
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,596
So, come in!

732
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,394
Damn who is it?
- Good afternoon.

733
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,590
Who are you looking for?
Who are you? What you want?

734
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,871
I am Cenek Semerad.
Good afternoon.

735
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,868
I came to see your son.
About something.

736
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:16,157
Please, come out. Hello.

737
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,073
No, he isn't going anywhere!
He'll stay here. You come in!

738
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,395
Oh no.
I'm okay here.

739
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,909
Do come in!
- It's nothing really.

740
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,474
I'll just tell him...
Look, I wouldn't like...

741
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,795
Come in! Sit down and talk it over
right here.

742
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,195
You're very kind,
but I'd rather stay right here.

743
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,914
Please, sit down and tell him.
- What?

744
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,792
Please, sit down.

745
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,071
Go ahead.
Say what you want to.

746
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,712
What's the matter?

747
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,112
What is it?

748
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:50,992
Well...

749
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,309
Okay then.

750
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,635
So, I would talk it over.

751
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,757
You know, when you loaned
me that twenty,

752
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:14,590
so, I would give them back,
but I gave the money,

753
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,154
I just stuck it in my pocket.

754
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,233
I didn't buy anything anymore.

755
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:23,511
So somehow I forgot about it.

756
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:28,111
I just didn't want you to think...
So I am giving it back right here.

757
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,960
Just wait, what's going on?
With money?

758
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,719
It's nothing.
He gave me some money.

759
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,592
I am only giving it back.
It belongs to him.

760
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,319
Have a piece of cake.

761
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:41,274
No, thanks. I don't want anything.
- Help yourself. Don't be shy.

762
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,436
I am not.
I would only like to leave.

763
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:48,076
What's your name?
- My name? I am Cenek Semerad.

764
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,430
All right, Mr. Cenek, take a piece.

765
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,917
Okay, I'll have one if you insist.

766
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:04,229
Good? Tasty?
- Oh, yeah.

767
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,356
So what do you do?

768
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:14,234
I'm an apprentice bricklayer.

769
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,112
So, bricklayer.

770
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,277
Show him your hands.

771
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:39,155
You mean my hands to show?
- Yes!

772
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,792
Look!

773
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:54,280
Take a good look!

774
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,356
I'd rather go.

775
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,515
So, goodbye.

776
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,756
Do you see that?

777
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,276
He's working hard!

778
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,400
He'll never turn into a hooligan.

779
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,196
And what about you?

780
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,232
"I don't know",

781
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,476
"I don't feel like it",

782
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,676
"I don't want to do it",

783
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,512
"I don't know".

784
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,475
So who is supposed to know?

785
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,552
Mum?

786
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,032
Dad?

787
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:49,189
I don't hold it against you
that you don't know.

788
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,360
It's normal at your age.

789
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,995
You will understand later.

790
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:00,594
But until you know
what you want

791
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,513
you'll do what I want you to do.

792
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:16,719
Good afternoon. Please, could you
hurry up. Come, so come.

793
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:20,389
Wait!
It's interesting here, mate.

794
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,196
This is my pal.

795
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,556
"Interesting",

796
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,312
"mate".

797
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,796
So for you it's interesting.

798
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:36,112
Oh, no, it's not
interesting at all! On the contrary.

799
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,155
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

800
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,515
You don't know what's what.

801
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,752
It's all about...

802
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:17,715
THE END
