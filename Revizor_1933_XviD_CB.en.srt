11
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,320
Don't look into the mirror,
if you have a splay mouth!

12
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,840
Well? Will you tell us
where our town is located?

13
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,000
So will you tell us or not?

14
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,520
Is it in America, Africa, Australia,
or in Europe?

15
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,200
Well? Or is our town
on the Moon, eh?

16
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,560
You blockhead!
Go to the corner!

17
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,200
Go on!

18
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,240
He thinks we live on the Moon.

19
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,440
No, children.

20
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,720
Our town is on Earth.

21
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,640
On the globe, on the map
and we can be proud of it.

22
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,960
As even if its
inhabitants and dignitaries

23
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,120
could be found in any
other town in the world,

24
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,040
our town is striving to be an exemplar
and a mirror of the whole world.

25
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,080
Put everything away!
The hetman is going shopping.

26
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,600
What are you packing?
- Cloth.

27
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,800
Why are you packing it?
- It's expensive cloth.

28
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,560
If it's expensive,
have it sent to my flat!

29
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,280
Hurry up!

30
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,760
Has mail arrived for
Petr Ivanovich Bobchinsky?

31
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,400
Have you mail for
Petr Ivanovich Dobchinsky?

32
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,160
Nothing, gentlemen, nothing.
No mail has arrived for

33
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,800
gentlemen farmers Bobchinsky
or Dobchinsky for ten years now.

34
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,680
Well, nothing doing.
- It can't be helped.

35
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,480
Very well.

36
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,160
Mr. A. A. Skvoznik-Dmuchanovsky

37
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,440
Should I open it or not,
open it or not...

38
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,520
Open it or not.
I should not.

39
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,360
I should.

40
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,680
An inspector!
- Inspector!

41
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,480
An Inspector General from St. Petersburg
and on a secret mission on top of it!

42
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,760
You see! We had absolute peace
and here we have it!

43
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,600
Good Lord, who is the letter from?
- A friend of mine from St. Petersburg.

44
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,520
He writes: My Dear Friend,
Godfather and Benefactor...

45
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,040
...and that he must inform me...
Oh, here it is.

46
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,040
I hurry to inform you that
an official has arrived with an order

47
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,600
to inspect the whole gubernia

48
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,400
and especially our district.

49
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,960
He works oneself off as
a private person.

50
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,840
And because I know that like everyone
else, you have some little sins...

51
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,120
...from here on,
he writes about family affairs.

52
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,240
And in the end he writes:
I advise you to be cautious,

53
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,240
I advise you all to be cautious.

54
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,280
As he may come at any moment,

55
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,840
if he has not arrived already
and is living among you.

56
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,040
He's been staying here for a fortnight
on trust and doesn't pay his bills!

57
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,680
You and your master,
you are both knaves!

58
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,640
And tell your master
that he's a rascal!

59
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,400
And that who doesn't pay,
won't eat!

60
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,840
But, sir...
- I won't mollycoddle him.

61
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,800
I'll have him locked up
and complain to the town hetman!

62
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,160
As the Town Hetman,
I informed you beforehand, gentlemen.

63
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,320
Beware, gentlemen.
And you in particular, Zemlyanika.

64
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,600
Me? Why me in particular?
- Because he'll be most interested

65
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,200
in those charitable institutions
of yours.

66
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,920
Have the floors washed.
- I will.

67
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,000
They haven't been washed for ten years
at least. - They weren't.

68
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,440
And buy two cuspidors.
- I'll buy three.

69
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,080
And spray them with carbolic acid.

70
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,520
So that it smells like in hospital
and not in a pub.

71
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,200
The patients will do everything today.
- And make sure they don't smoke.

72
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,920
And if they do, they mustn't
smoke that cheap tobacco.

73
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,280
It would be also advisable to make
the patients look better!

74
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,800
And that court house of yours
is also in a terrible mess.

75
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,680
Mine? - Yes, yours. You keep
geese and other fowl in the hall.

76
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,840
You have pigeons and chicken grain
in the bookshelves instead of files.

77
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,680
And instead of prisoners,
you keep hounds in jail.

78
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,760
A farm is a nice thing, but don't
make pig-sties out of offices,

79
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,760
it's not proper, my friend.
- But... - Moreover...

80
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,160
You accept bribes.
- I do not!

81
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,680
I only accepted the hounds
and that is not a bribe.

82
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,640
A hound or not, it is a bribe.

83
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,360
And what if someone's fur coat
costs five hundred roubles?

84
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,360
Or his wife's shawl... - Very well,
let us say a hound is not a bribe.

85
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,560
But you don't believe in God
and don't go to church!

86
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,000
You should be on your guard
too, Schoolmaster!

87
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,800
Me? I didn't do anything!

88
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,840
And where are the books from
the town library? Where are they?

89
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,360
Bargain books!

90
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,760
Two pounds for two roubles.

91
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,040
They cost five hundred roubles.
But let's not talk about it.

92
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,720
You ought to keep an eye
on that history teacher.

93
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,160
He lectures with such ardor
that he's often beside himself.

94
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,520
I listened to him once and as long
as he spoke about the Assyrians,

95
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,920
and the Babylonians, all went well. But
once he came to Alexander the Great...

96
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,600
Alexander the Great

97
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,840
rushed into the fiercest battle
as a lion!

98
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,000
The enemy began retreating.

99
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,720
Alexander the Great was victorious!

100
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,720
Alexander the Great was a hero!

101
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,000
Alexander the Great indeed
was a hero, but why break chairs?

102
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,520
It inflicts damage upon
the public treasury, gentlemen,

103
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,000
and you see what it leads to.
An inspector!

104
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,520
And an inspector likes that dogs out
pokes his nose into everything!

105
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,120
Good hail, what a fine helping!

106
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Good hail, what a fine helping!

107
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,640
Where's our meal?
- We're hungry.

108
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,640
Just a moment, gentlemen.

109
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,920
I'm just inspecting, gentlemen.

110
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,280
Inspect...
...or!

111
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,000
Come here!

112
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,960
Who is he?
- When did he arrive?

113
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,200
He's here for a fortnight! An official
from St. Petersburg, a Mr. Khlestakov.

114
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,360
An official?
- From St. Petersburg?

115
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,280
You see, gentlemen,
I am not afraid.

116
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,360
But what if there
was some denunciation.

117
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,880
Why would an inspector
otherwise come here?

118
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,040
I expect the door
will open suddenly

119
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,040
and he'll storm in.

120
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,720
An extraordinary event!
- Unexpected news!

121
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,280
Quite unforeseen!
- What's the matter?

122
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,040
I come from the inn.
- No, I come from the inn!

123
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,600
He accompanied me.
- Allow me, Petr Ivanovich,

124
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,480
I shall tell them.
- No, Petr Ivanovich, I'll tell them.

125
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,320
Sit down, gentlemen.
Tell us what happened?

126
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,680
Let's start from the beginning.
- Yes, from the beginning.

127
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,960
We were terribly hungry.

128
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,760
So we dropped in the inn.
- Yes, we rushed into the inn,

129
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,960
and there - crickey!
- Indeed, gentlemen, crickey!

130
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,640
Standing in front of us is...
- Who?!

131
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,720
A stranger. - Young.
- Serious...

132
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,200
A gentleman in plain clothes.

133
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,520
Walking to...
- And fro.

134
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,520
Looking quite serious.
- Composed.

135
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,200
That look!
- Those manners!

136
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,680
So, we told ourselves...
- There's something fishy about that.

137
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,600
I nodded towards the waiter.
Come here.

138
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,840
And he says: It's Ivan Alexandrovich
Khlestakov from St. Petersburg.

139
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,880
He's heading for the Saratov Gubernia
and he's been here for a fortnight now!

140
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,200
For a fortnight!
- He doesn't leave the inn.

141
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,240
He doesn't pay for anything,
he lives on credit!

142
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,560
That's why I told myself - well now!
- No, I was the first to say "well now".

143
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,360
I was the first to say "well now"
and then you said "well now".

144
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,760
Well now. Why is he here?

145
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,240
He is...
- The inspector!

146
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
The inspector!
- For heaven's sake!

147
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,440
Just think what happened
in the two weeks?

148
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,520
The sergeant's wife was whipped,
the prisoners weren't fed,

149
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,120
the streets are dirty!

150
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,240
Gentlemen, let's set to work!
Give the alarm!

151
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,480
Anton!

152
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,040
He left.
And it is all your fault!

153
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,560
For being so foppish and sluggish.

154
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,880
One more pin, one more ribbon.
- But, Mother!

155
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,280
Hush! It's your fault
they left without us.

156
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,560
Now I don't even know
how the inspector looks.

157
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,920
What color are his eyes,
how does he dress.

158
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,120
A tail-coat.
What if I sell my tail-coat?

159
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,600
I'm terribly hungry.
- So am I.

160
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,200
Terribly hungry.
Like master like servant.

161
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,120
Did I ask you something, Joseph?

162
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,800
If I had money,

163
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,000
we'd go home in an equipage,
I inside and you liveried at the back.

164
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,240
And before the crowd,
you would step down

165
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,600
and announce... - Ivan Alexandrovich
Khlestakov from St. Petersburg.

166
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,840
Someone's coming.

167
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,240
The innkeeper says it's the last time.

168
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,440
What did you bring us?

169
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,760
Soup and roast-meat.

170
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,800
How come just two courses?
- Just two.

171
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,800
I do not accept that!
Wait, leave it here.

172
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,960
What's this?
What's this?

173
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,800
It's a helping for a sick man.

174
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,680
And not for a man
who hasn't eaten for two days!

175
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,000
Where's the starter?
- There's no starter.

176
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,520
And why not? This morning,
I saw two fellows in the kitchen

177
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,480
stuffing themselves with salmon
and God knows what else!

178
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,320
Aren't I such a guest too?
- No, you're not.

179
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,720
Why not?
- Because they pay.

180
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,360
I don't give a damn about that!

181
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,640
What's this?
What's this?

182
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,920
Is this supposed to be roast-meat?

183
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,600
It's a roast axe, not meat!

184
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,560
Rascals! Scoundrels!
So this is how you treat me!

185
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,200
Ah, the innkeeper.

186
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Here's your soup.

187
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,360
What's up? What's the matter?
- He's angry.

188
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,200
Who's angry?
- The official from St. Petersburg.

189
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,120
The official from St. Petersburg!

190
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,720
How could you get him so angry!

191
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,400
And he didn't even...
- Hush! - Shh!

192
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,640
But...
- Hush!

193
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,440
He's an inspector!

194
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,240
Shh!

195
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,600
Shh!

196
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,440
Who was that?
Shh!

197
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,200
Shh! Gendarmes!

198
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,080
That innkeeper is such a bugger.

199
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,960
He peached on me to the hetman
and the hetman brought gendarmes.

200
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,240
What if they really put me in jail!

201
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,200
That can't be possible.

202
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,120
They can't take me through the town
like some merchant or tradesman!

203
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,560
I'm an official from St. Petersburg.
- Yes, sir. - What?

204
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,320
Indeed! I will put it straight to him!

205
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm an official from St. Petersburg!

206
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,760
How dare you!
- Yes, sir!

207
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,120
How dare you!

208
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,680
Come in!

209
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,680
Good day, sir.
- Good day.

210
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,640
I beg your pardon.
- Not at all.

211
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,120
And... how dare you?

212
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,200
As the local hetman,

213
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,840
I consider it my duty

214
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,360
to look after the well-being
of travelers

215
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,240
and fellow citizens on the whole,
to make sure no harm is done to them.

216
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,240
To ensure order,

217
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,000
and on the whole...
- And on the whole,

218
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,240
and order on the whole.

219
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,280
The meat tasted like an axe
and I spilled the soup.

220
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,160
Don't be angry, sir, I'm not to blame.

221
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,120
Believe me, meat on our market
is usually fine.

222
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,160
And God knows where
the rascal got it from.

223
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,360
I beg you not to tell anyone else.

224
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,720
If you wish, you could move.

225
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,680
Move?
- To another flat.

226
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,320
To jail.
So you think

227
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,840
I'll go to jail because of you.
Catch me doing it!

228
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,000
How dare you!

229
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,600
Do you know who I am?
I'm an official from St. Petersburg!

230
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,680
I'm not going with you anywhere!

231
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,840
If I go somewhere,
I'll go complain to the Minister!

232
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,840
Have mercy.
I have a wife and a child!

233
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,280
Why should I care!

234
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,560
Should I go with you just because
you have a wife and a child, eh?

235
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,160
And end up in jail?
All for your pretty eyes!

236
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,000
And as the whole
town is such a mess,

237
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,400
I'll go complain to the Tsar himself!

238
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,440
Forgive me, please.

239
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,440
It's all because of my inexperience.
The Lord knows!

240
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,080
Kindly see

241
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,360
that the dismal circumstances...

242
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,600
If I ever accepted
a small graft here and there,

243
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,680
it was merely something for the kitchen,
or a trinket for my wife or child.

244
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,000
A trifle.
- This is no trifle.

245
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,320
This is a question of big money.
- I didn't take any money!

246
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,640
Only trifles or a loan...

247
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,640
A loan, eh?
I can't lend you money.

248
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,880
I have no money myself.

249
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,320
It's my duty to help travelers.

250
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,440
If you allow me, I would...
- The thing is...

251
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,800
The thing is that a certain captain

252
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,080
fleeced me of all my money
and so I would need,

253
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,880
let's say two hundred roubles.

254
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,080
Well, if you allow me,

255
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,840
I would...

256
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,400
I can see

257
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,040
that you are a considerate person.

258
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,720
And this completely changes
the whole situation.

259
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,440
He took it!
- He took it.

260
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,320
He took it.

261
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,760
He took the money.
Let's hope everything will be settled.

262
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,200
Bring him our best food, quick!

263
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,720
Sit down.

264
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,920
The room seems rather damp.

265
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,720
Well, that wouldn't be so bad.

266
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,000
But the bedbugs are big as beans.

267
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,840
And they bite like mad dogs.

268
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,360
Oh! Such a prominent guest
like you suffers?

269
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,240
And from what?
From miserable, anonymous bedbugs!

270
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,080
Could I ask you, Your Grace?

271
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,000
You may.

272
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,320
Could I humbly offer to Your Excellency

273
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,200
a beautiful and airy flat in my house.

274
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,960
It would be an honor for me.

275
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,840
Indeed, it would be an honor for you.

276
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,880
I accept.

277
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,160
My wife and my daughter will be most
pleased, if you do us the honor

278
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,600
and step on the porch of our house.

279
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,200
With pleasure.

280
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,760
I demand only four things.

281
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,960
Respect and loyalty,
loyalty and respect.

282
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,440
My manservant Joseph.

283
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,280
Get out!
There's no time for this!

284
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,520
Refreshment will be served
during the tour of the town.

285
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,280
You shall see for yourself
how all is in apple-pie order.

286
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,440
We shall inspect the jail and...

287
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,680
What's all this jail business?

288
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,040
Let's inspect the storerooms,

289
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,400
the kitchens, et cetera.
- As you wish.

290
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,480
Your Grace, would you allow me
to write a note to my wife,

291
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,360
to prepare to welcome
such a prominent guest?

292
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,280
Of course.
- Oh yes.

293
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,960
Could I write it on this bill?

294
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,160
Thank you.

295
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,000
Oh my!
What a pleasant surprise.

296
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,240
Did you hurt yourself?

297
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,520
It's nothing.

298
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,240
We don't mean to disturb you.

299
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,120
It's venison in cream sauce.
- It is, Your Excellency.

300
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,160
And a pikeperch is in the oven.
- Indeed, Your Excellency.

301
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,480
Take this to my wife.

302
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,880
And will there be a starter?

303
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,960
Yes, Your Excellency.
- Very well!

304
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,480
Good day, Anna Andreyevna.

305
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,920
Shame on you! You ran away
and I didn't know what was happening.

306
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,600
But...
- I nursed your little Ivan.

307
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,160
And your Lizzie,
while you treat me like that.

308
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,360
Good Lord, I was in such a hurry

309
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,160
to pay my respects to you
I can hardly catch my breath.

310
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,000
Go on, tell me what happened.

311
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,400
Anton Antonovich sends this note.

312
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,680
Who is that man? A general?

313
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,760
He's not a general, though
he certainly grades up with a general.

314
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,280
He has such authority and manners.

315
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,720
The hetman must be writing
something very important. - Is he?

316
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,520
I kiss your hand, my dear,

317
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,040
and remain your
Anton Skvoznik-Dmuchanovsky.

318
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,440
I do not understand.

319
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,480
Here's the beginning,
Anna Andreyevna!

320
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,920
He outran me with the end.
- I see.

321
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,720
I hurry to inform you, my dear,
that my position was rather somber,

322
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,960
yet having faith in God,

323
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,720
two pickles for five kopecks each,

324
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,360
half a serving of caviar.

325
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,560
What do the pickles mean?

326
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,920
Anton Antonovich wrote it in a hurry
on a piece of paper at the inn.

327
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,440
It was a bill.
- It was.

328
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,480
Yet having faith in God and His mercy,

329
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,280
I trust everything shall end well.

330
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,360
Prepare a room for a prominent
guest forthwith.

331
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,560
The one decorated with yellow tapestry.

332
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:59,160
It must be done at once. Such a noble
gentleman! Where did they go?

333
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,800
They went to inspect...
...the charitable institutions.

334
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,240
How did I teach you.

335
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,120
As soon as the door opens,
you will say:

336
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,600
Welcome, Inspector General.

337
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,720
Welcome, Inspector General.

338
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,600
Where were you?
Sit down at once!

339
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,160
Sit down!

340
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,720
Don't put me to shame!

341
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,120
Welcome, Inspector General.

342
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,600
Should I put the goat in the yard
or leave it here?

343
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,600
Out! Out with it!
Quick!

344
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,960
Hush! Quiet!

345
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,520
Who the devil is it this time!

346
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,800
Welcome, Inspector General.

347
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,840
Thank you for such a kind welcome.

348
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,160
This is a charming orphanage.

349
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,840
This is a school, Your Excellency.

350
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,800
Oh, it is a school, eh?

351
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,760
Dear children, how old are you?
How old is he?

352
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,640
Seven, Excellency.
- Seven? Can that be?

353
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,440
Really, Your Excellency,
he's seven.

354
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,920
Is it possible to get so dirty
in seven years?

355
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,040
No!
- It's broken, Excellency.

356
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,720
The chair?
- Yes.

357
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,360
When was it broken?

358
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,920
The chair was broken
during the reign of Alexander the Great.

359
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,640
It lasted quite long.

360
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,400
How do you like your school,
children?

361
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,840
Your teacher likes it here.

362
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,280
The children too, Excellency,
they can't do without their school.

363
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,160
That is praiseworthy.

364
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,200
So, those who cannot do without
the school will stay here,

365
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,760
while the rest will have holidays
for two weeks.

366
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,760
Yippee!

367
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,120
They can't do without it, eh?

368
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,160
It seems your pupils rolled away
like a heap of melons.

369
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,400
Your Excellency.
- Very well then.

370
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,040
I'm deeply touched.
Shall we continue?

371
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,520
Thank you.
- This way.

372
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,400
An adorable boy.

373
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,480
Your Excellency! I'm innocent
and they had me whipped.

374
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,760
That miserable town hetman had
me whipped although I'm innocent!

375
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,280
I swear she is lying, Your Excellency!
- I'm not lying! - Go away!

376
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:28,200
I'm not lying, Your Excellency!
- Go away! This way, Your Excellency.

377
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,800
Let us continue, Your Excellency.

378
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,640
You need a tamer for this snake.

379
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,640
Where shall we go now?

380
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,440
To the town jail, Your Excellency.
- To jail?

381
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,080
What's all this jail business about?

382
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,800
Why don't you show me
where I'm staying instead.

383
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,800
As you wish, Your Excellency,
the room is ready.

384
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,480
This way, Your Excellency.

385
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,360
Over here, please.

386
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,760
The General will live here.

387
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,680
Oh my, I was so hungry.
Terribly hungry.

388
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,720
When will the General come?
- What general?

389
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,920
Your master, of course.

390
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,440
Who told you he's a general?

391
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,840
Isn't he a general?
- He is.

392
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,880
See.
- But under cover!

393
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,560
Under cover, eh?
- Yes.

394
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,840
And is his ranking higher or lower
than of a true general?

395
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,680
Higher.
But you know nothing!

396
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,200
And not a word to anyone!

397
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,040
Of course.

398
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,000
It's such a drudgery.

399
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,080
Such drudgery.

400
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,280
It's him!
- It must be him!

401
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,760
He's handsome.
- Quite a good looker.

402
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,160
He's such a handsome man.

403
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,920
Come in, Your Excellency.
- Your institutions are remarkable.

404
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,000
Besides, I like how you show
everything to travelers.

405
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,000
In other towns,
they've shown me nothing.

406
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,160
In other towns,
forgive me for being so daring,

407
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,000
town hetmans
care about their own benefit.

408
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,520
I care about the prosperity of the state
and the welfare of the people.

409
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,640
Your Excellency, allow me to introduce

410
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,800
the wife and the daughter.
- Whose wife? Whose daughter?

411
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,000
My own, Your Excellency.

412
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,200
Madam, I am so pleased
to have ended here,

413
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,520
in your town.
- I am more pleased

414
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,720
to be able to welcome
such a noble guest.

415
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,640
Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

416
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,960
Sit down, gentlemen.

417
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,600
Do sit down,
I'm not fond of much ado.

418
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,800
I like being unnoticed.

419
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,840
But as soon as I appear somewhere
back in St. Petersburg

420
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,120
I hear everyone say:
"Ivan Alexandrovich is coming."

421
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,600
Soldiers jump out
from the guardhouse, saluting me.

422
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,880
Pushkin calls at me:
"Where are you going, my friend?"

423
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,960
And I answer: "Nowhere in particular."

424
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,960
I heard you are also a writer.

425
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,200
Indeed, I wrote a good many works.

426
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,560
I can hardly remember them all.
At random, I can tell you

427
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,200
that I wrote Figaro's Wedding,
Robinson Crusoe,

428
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,960
Dante's Divine Comedy by Petrarca.

429
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,880
That's interesting.
- I live for literature.

430
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,840
My house is full of artists,
from the cellar to the roof.

431
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,800
Visitors, counts, princes.

432
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,080
It looks like in a beehive in the
morning, everything is buzzing.

433
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,960
I throw balls and receptions.

434
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,160
Serving all sorts of specialities.

435
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,080
A melon for seven hundred roubles.

436
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,040
The soup is shipped
directly from Paris by boat.

437
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,480
You won't find such
steam anywhere else.

438
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,800
That smell!

439
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,160
And when I'm not at home,

440
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,960
couriers run around all over
the city and find me

441
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,560
even if I were bathing
in my birthday costume.

442
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,840
I wish to write now.
Where's my room?

443
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,840
As you wish, Your Excellency.

444
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,240
Would you like to have a rest,
Your Excellency?

445
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,760
Oh no, thank you.

446
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,040
I shall write.

447
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,480
Does it have two tips?
Isn't it crippled?

448
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,320
What a man!

449
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,880
I've never been in the company
of such a personage.

450
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,040
I almost died of fear!
I was shivering like that.

451
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,080
I shivered more.
- I beg your pardon, I shivered...

452
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,120
Wait, I...
- Come now, gentlemen!

453
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,240
I think he's a general in the least.

454
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,080
A general, he must be
at least a generalissimo!

455
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,240
Didn't you hear how he
made the state council sweat?

456
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,000
How counts and princes are
buzzing in his hall?

457
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,120
Princes and counts.
- And what did I say?

458
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,880
Come now, gentlemen.
- Let's go.

459
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,440
We'll be back in no time in our best.
- And we shall request an audience.

460
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,760
At your service.
- At your service.

461
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,920
I only wanted to tell you

462
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,920
that in case you need anything

463
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,520
just ring the bell.

464
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,520
Unfortunately, there's no bell here.

465
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,160
It doesn't matter though.
I can do

466
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,400
ding dong like that, but I don't
need anything for now.

467
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,680
Well, in case you do need anything

468
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,000
do that ding dong.

469
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,920
Ding dong.

470
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,000
Buy yourself some tea and tell me
what interests your master the most.

471
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,840
What does His Excellency like the most?

472
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,800
He likes to be well feasted.

473
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,640
Buy yourself a pretzel and continue.

474
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,920
Well, when we leave some place,
my master always asks me:

475
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,960
"Well, Joseph, how did they treat you?

476
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,960
And I tell him:
"Badly, master, badly."

477
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,480
And he says:
"That's a bad husbandman, Joseph.

478
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,320
Remind me of his name when
we come to St. Petersburg."

479
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,680
Come, tell us about your master.
We will give you some money too.

480
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,960
Out you go!
Go to the other room!

481
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,440
Come here, buy yourself a vodka

482
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,480
and tell your master

483
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,600
that if someone peached
on me that he's a liar!

484
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,200
Peach on you.
Who would dare such a thing?

485
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,360
We must dare to do it!
- Yes, we have to complain.

486
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,440
Yes!
- Wrong is being done to us!

487
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,760
He takes everything he sees.
- Everything!

488
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,040
Let's put it down in writing.
- Let's do that!

489
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,040
Write it down.

490
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,400
My Dear Friend, Those asses take me
for an Inspector General.

491
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,440
You would burst with laughter,
if you saw the honors they do me.

492
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,720
There are guards everywhere,

493
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:29,200
as if I were a Governor.

494
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,680
You'll stay here! And should someone
come with a complaint

495
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,560
or should he look
as if coming to file a complaint,

496
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,680
you'll throw him out!
And properly!

497
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,720
What's this? Quiet!

498
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,960
If only he took the palm grease.

499
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,760
If we could palm it on him somehow.
- Who shall go first?

500
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,680
Not me! Not me.
- Shh! Quiet!

501
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,560
His Excellency must be writing
a letter to St. Petersburg.

502
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,280
Mr. Tryapichkin, Editor
St. Petersburg

503
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,680
I'm going first!

504
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,760
Enter!

505
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,720
Is some dog scratching away its fleas?

506
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,880
Oh, it's you.

507
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,840
Do you have cold fever?
- I have the honor to introduce myself.

508
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,440
I am the judge of the local
District Court, Lyapkin-Tyapkin.

509
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,240
I beg your pardon?
- Lyapkin-Tyapkin.

510
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,040
I was nominated for the fourth class
Order of St. Vladimir.

511
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,160
Oh, Vladimir is nice,

512
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,440
and fourth class is higher
than the third.

513
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,320
You've beat out some money!

514
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,520
It's not worth mentioning,
Your Excellency.

515
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,200
Three hundred roubles.

516
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,320
How much?

517
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,920
You are, as they say,
careless with money.

518
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,720
What if you lend me the money?

519
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,120
With greatest pleasure,
Your Excellency.

520
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,320
I shall be most honored,

521
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,640
and I shall strive to deserve it
with immense diligence

522
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:28,080
and obedience, and I shall not take
Your Excellency's time any longer.

523
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,080
Is there anything else?

524
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,920
That's enough for the time being.

525
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,360
Come in.

526
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,360
Your Excellency,
allow me to introduce myself.

527
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,200
Postmaster Shpekin.

528
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,640
Postmaster?

529
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,640
You accept money, don't you?
- No, I don't.

530
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,640
Never, Your Excellency.

531
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,840
I don't think so.

532
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,520
I believe you accept
and send monetary consignments.

533
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,000
The thing is I am amazed that
no one has sent me any money,

534
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,920
although I need it rather urgently.

535
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,080
Do you have three
hundred roubles on you?

536
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,360
I don't, but I have
four hundred roubles.

537
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,400
Four hundred?

538
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,600
Well, this somewhat interferes
with my budget,

539
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,320
but nothing doing, give it to me.

540
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,720
It's settled then.

541
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,120
Have you any other special orders,
Your Excellency?

542
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,520
I have.

543
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,960
Send this letter for me,
postage shall be paid by the state.

544
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,000
You may go.

545
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,520
Hurry up.

546
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,720
Next!

547
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,880
Your schools are well managed.

548
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,800
I'm very pleased.

549
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,960
Is your button missing?

550
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,960
It isn't.
Button up.

551
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,200
You may go.

552
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,800
Allow me to introduce myself.

553
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,200
I am the superintendent of the charity
institutions, Zemlyanika.

554
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,480
Zemlyanika.

555
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,640
Do you wish to add anything else?

556
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,880
I mean as a traveling man...
- I understand.

557
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,560
You do...
- I fully understand.

558
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,440
Besides, it's prepared
here in the envelope.

559
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,720
Thank you.
I won't keep you any longer.

560
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,360
Time is money.

561
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,320
Money. I always say the same,
Your Excellency.

562
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,320
Money.
Don't put it away.

563
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,320
Its contents is valuable.

564
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,560
I most pleased that
you offer me your help

565
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,800
in such a delicate manner.

566
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,560
Zemlyanika!

567
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,840
You are to submit three hundred roubles
for duty stamps to this application.

568
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,440
As you wish, Your Excellency.

569
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,840
Don't forget, Zemlyanika.

570
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,760
I won't. Zemlyanika.

571
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,720
Let's go to His Excellency!
- Let's go!

572
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,600
What's the matter here?

573
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,640
Throw them out! Whip them out!
- Out you go!

574
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,360
I'm a retired major,
Excellency.

575
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,320
I served under Zadunaysky.

576
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,200
I know Zadunaysky.
A short, podgy man, isn't he?

577
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,520
Not at all, Your Excellency,
he's tall and slim.

578
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,440
He's tall and slim, you're right.
He has a beard and looks like Napoleon.

579
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,320
Napoleon!
- But he died, Your Excellency.

580
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,680
He passed away thirty years ago.

581
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:16,120
Did he?
But whom do I know then?

582
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:21,720
I also served with Trepatkin.
- With Trepatkin.

583
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,560
I don't want to keep you.
Do you have money for me?

584
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,600
What money?
- For me, not to pass it over.

585
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,440
I don't have any money.

586
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:35,080
I came to ask Your Excellency

587
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,480
to put in a word for me
in St. Petersburg.

588
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,040
As my petitions to increase
my pension were in vain.

589
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,680
When was that?
- Well, that was in the year...

590
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,480
...thirty years ago.

591
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,520
Thirty years ago?
So you will apply

592
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,520
for the Order of St. Vladimir
for waiting for sixty years.

593
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,560
For thirty years.
- For sixty years.

594
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,520
You've waited for thirty, you'll wait
for another thirty, that makes sixty.

595
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,120
Farewell.

596
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,800
What's the matter?

597
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,760
Let's go home in time, my lord.

598
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,400
Let's come home famous!

599
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,880
Nonsense, we won't leave now,
when money is pouring in, you fool.

600
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,160
I bring one more petitioner,
Your Excellency.

601
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,560
I see.
- Your Grace.

602
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,320
I took the liberty of arranging
a dinner in your honor.

603
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,880
The best food, the most
expensive beverages, and music.

604
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,440
Long live His Excellency!
- Vivat!

605
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,520
Ladies and Gentlemen.

606
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,440
My dear children.

607
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,600
I am satisfied with the inspection.

608
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,680
And I am more than glad
to declare that you all take...

609
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,840
take everything
bearing in mind your responsibility.

610
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,920
I feel like in St. Petersburg.

611
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:31,200
At home in St. Petersburg
I enjoy respect.

612
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:37,560
Bribable officials
call me my lord.

613
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:44,320
When I ride in my equipage
across the Neva Prospect,

614
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:52,120
no one gets in my way,
everyone showing their respect.

615
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:02,400
At home in St. Petersburg,
when I come to the palace,

616
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:09,120
the Tsar is walking in his gardens,
inviting me upstairs.

617
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:16,640
He offers me tea with vodka,
chatting like old friends.

618
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:24,840
After tea with Nikolai,
we play cards till the break of day.

619
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,760
Let's hope they don't find out.

620
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,840
Find out what?
- That we drank.

621
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:05,120
I see, I thought you mean that they
wouldn't find out... oh my.

622
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,480
The air is wonderful here.

623
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,400
I assure you

624
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:33,760
that the Tsar and the Tsarina will
come here to spend the summer.

625
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,680
I must do that trick
with the handkerchief.

626
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:09,080
That's strange, I've done it
more than a hundred times

627
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,160
and I've never managed to do it right.

628
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,320
But I'll work with the table.

629
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:41,360
Do you know, you sly dogs,
that I like it here very much?

630
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,160
As long as Your Excellency
is satisfied here.

631
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,520
I'm more than satisfied. I'm actually
thrilled with my staying here.

632
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:54,920
Thrilled! I truly do not know
how shall I reciprocate.

633
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,240
I would have a humble request,

634
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,080
Your Grace.
- Say it.

635
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,280
I beseech you...
- So do I.

636
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:09,760
When you come to St. Petersburg,
tell all those noble men,

637
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,320
senators, and admirals,

638
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,280
"Your Eminence or Excellency,

639
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:20,560
Petr Ivanovich Bobchinsky
lives in this town."

640
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,480
Nothing else.

641
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,280
That Petr Ivanovich Bobchinsky
lives in this town.

642
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,680
And Petr Ivanovich Dobchinsky,
a gentleman farmer.

643
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,480
I shall tell them.

644
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:35,760
And should you speak to the Tsar,
tell him:

645
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,800
"Your Majesty,

646
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,960
Petr Ivanovich Bobchinsky,

647
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:46,800
a farmer, lives in this town.

648
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,760
And Petr Ivanovich Dobchinsky,
also a farmer.

649
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:55,480
Very well, I shall.
Farewell.

650
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,760
Goodbye.
- We are most grateful.

651
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,680
Anna Andreyevna.
- Good night. - Good night.

652
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,800
Are you leaving as well?

653
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,080
I don't mean to disturb you. You surely
have more serious work to do.

654
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,840
Not at all,

655
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,640
your eyes are far more prettier,

656
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,400
than the most serious work.

657
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,160
You're speaking like in St. Petersburg.
- Because of you.

658
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:38,400
I'd like to offer you a chair.
Not a chair! A throne!

659
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,960
A throne.
And I would kneel in front of it.

660
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,040
I would like to be your necklace

661
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,800
and embrace your lily-white neck.

662
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,200
I would like to kiss your red lips.

663
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,640
Look!

664
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,720
My dear children!
I'm so happy!

665
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,320
What a surprise!
- What honor!

666
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,120
What fortune! Truly.
- God bless you, my dear daughter.

667
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:18,360
Who would ever think of this!
My child!

668
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,160
Who would have guessed?
Such a thing.

669
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,280
Let us go to bed now, children.
- Yes.

670
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,280
You may kiss. There.

671
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,440
Thank you.

672
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,720
Dear Excellency,
go and rest into your room.

673
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,040
Oh yes, I shall go to my room.
- Very well.

674
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:48,280
Good night,
good morning, dear family.

675
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,880
Now you put perfume on,
when it's all over.

676
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,920
Who could have imagined before.
- I did, immediately.

677
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,280
He watched no one but you all evening.

678
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,320
He didn't take his eyes off you.

679
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,040
Fortune has come.

680
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,920
I ordered the water to be warmed up.
You will take a bath.

681
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:18,040
His Excellency,
your fiancé will also take a bath.

682
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,960
We shall let him rest now.

683
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,280
Bye bye, my dear Excellency.

684
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,200
What fortune!

685
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:41,520
The whole town has to know.

686
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,480
The hetman thinks
he'll become a general.

687
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,960
It would suit him like a saddle a cow.

688
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,640
A general, eh?

689
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,760
What do you think, could they
soon promote me to a general?

690
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,160
Of course, leave that to me.

691
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:42,080
We'll move to St. Petersburg
and you can give up your hetmanship.

692
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,880
Of course!

693
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,080
It's so easy for him to have
me appointed as the governor,

694
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:53,000
if he's friend with all the ministers
and visits the palace.

695
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,960
You shall finish with them varmints!

696
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,400
Indeed!

697
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,480
What if they appoint me

698
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,360
as a minister?

699
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,320
I will send people to Siberia.

700
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:15,000
Show me, is your chest
wide enough for medals?

701
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,520
There's room for plenty!
- Come, congratulators are here.

702
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:31,920
Don't congratulate him!
The inspector is a fake!

703
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:35,000
Read here,
what he writes about you all.

704
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:38,680
What names he calls you!
All of you.

705
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:20,000
...and the schoolintendent
is such an idiot,

706
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:24,320
good only for watching
the cattle range!

707
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:38,360
There will be really something
to laugh at in St. Petersburg!

708
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:43,840
Look, my dear people,
look, all Christian world

709
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,720
how he deceived me!
Me, a town hetman!

710
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,520
Where is he?

711
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,640
He's gone!

712
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,800
Laugh at me!
I'm dead! I'm ruined!

713
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,040
Hetman, the Inspector General
has just arrived from St. Petersburg

714
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,720
and asks you to visit him immediately.

715
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:40,840
The End

716
