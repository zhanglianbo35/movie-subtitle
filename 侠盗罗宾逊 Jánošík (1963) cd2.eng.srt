12
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:56,807
Send Huncaj,
to bring the saw!

13
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:03,965
- What is father Uhorcík cooking?
- What else? A ram!

14
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:10,488
Swords and axes are of no use here,
we need barrels of gunpowder.

15
00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:13,571
l will hit the provincial gunpowder storage.

16
00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:17,044
For whom are you preparing
that gibbet-loop, Brute?

17
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:19,767
Who knows, maybe for my own head.

18
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:22,563
For you l am going to make a nicer one,
l´ll take your measures!

19
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:27,804
Weak! The lords are preparing a hook for me!

20
00:03:29,814 --> 00:03:31,133
Ropemaker...

21
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:38,330
Chop! l will chop three of you down.

22
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:49,173
lndeed, aiming is the most important
when shooting.

23
00:03:49,214 --> 00:03:52,889
Not the target... that goes by itself.

24
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:57,610
l only looked at it and booom!

25
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,613
And the soldier, rolled over!

26
00:04:01,654 --> 00:04:04,452
Such a shooter am l!

27
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,052
l saw that, father!

28
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:09,689
l don´t know if the captain appoints me
the main shooter.

29
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:20,412
l will shoot a swallow in flight
and a stag in the valley.

30
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:24,407
l bet, you´ve shoot today again...
a ram.

31
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:27,127
You can´t cook anything else.

32
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:29,290
Don´t croak, you Liptov´s menace!

33
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:33,646
You never even smelled a Turkish
style ram.

34
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:38,364
They say you fed your men with frogs!

35
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:41,963
What you... !

36
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:52,288
Three men under the camp!
Michalec, go see!

37
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:19,409
Catch me!

38
00:05:19,454 --> 00:05:22,571
- Why are you screaming?
- Your blanket is ready!

39
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:29,005
Where did you find it?

40
00:05:29,054 --> 00:05:33,206
Come, drag these altarboys,
l am out of breath.

41
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:37,247
- What religion are they?
- Polish gorals. Can´t you see the beauty?

42
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:40,286
Look, they even go robbing with an
eagle´s feather in their hats.

43
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:44,885
Come, we´ll rattle for you, they´ll
inquire you up there.

44
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:50,203
We´re sending our greetings to heaven!

45
00:05:58,894 --> 00:06:03,445
Look, Gajdošík found some Polish twins.

46
00:06:03,494 --> 00:06:08,124
They got tired of Polish poverty so
they came to the Slovaks to be poor.

47
00:06:08,174 --> 00:06:11,962
They cried until now,
they´ll moan from now on.

48
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:14,574
- Seize!
- Secure it, fellows!

49
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:18,129
Lift your feet, you are entering
the free land.

50
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:19,084
This way.

51
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:26,731
Olders to the captain!

52
00:06:26,774 --> 00:06:31,131
Always the olders only! l am old,
but they are not calling me.

53
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:32,607
Just because you are old.

54
00:06:32,654 --> 00:06:38,047
Older also means wiser.

55
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:44,886
Father Uhorcík, to the captain!

56
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:49,325
Out of the way! The captain calls the wise
men.

57
00:06:57,134 --> 00:07:03,812
You came here voluntarily to make justice in
this crooked world by an axe.

58
00:07:03,854 --> 00:07:09,133
And so, like we did, swear in front
of the elders on the axe!

59
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:13,690
Put your hands here. You too!

60
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:18,967
We swear in front of the faces of
the elders...

61
00:07:19,014 --> 00:07:23,132
that we will never spill innocent blood...

62
00:07:23,174 --> 00:07:28,248
we won´t give away bandits´ secrets,
not even if tortured...

63
00:07:28,294 --> 00:07:35,848
and if necessary, we will sacrifice
our lives for our friends.

64
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:38,249
This we swear!

65
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:40,524
Welcome, brothers!

66
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:44,772
Welcome!

67
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:51,883
Father, pour the wine!

68
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:57,008
- Let´s proceed to God´s table.
- Pity that we don´t swear every day.

69
00:07:57,054 --> 00:08:02,651
- Wait, one by one!
- So, first to the newcomers.

70
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:06,573
- And to the captain!
- That´s how it should be!

71
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:16,372
l am coming! For God´s sake,
who is it at this hour?

72
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:19,128
l´m coming, coming!

73
00:08:23,574 --> 00:08:24,802
Good evening, father.

74
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:33,125
So bad... like this, with a weapon.

75
00:08:33,174 --> 00:08:37,292
Leave! Bad luck follows you.

76
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:43,603
We don´t have any peace anymore,
the lords haunt, beat, torture us.

77
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:46,487
That´s why l´m looking for the count.

78
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:51,528
We are withering away, we cannot
even say mass anymore.

79
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,849
They say we are being noisy in the church.

80
00:08:53,894 --> 00:08:55,964
Where did count Aurel go?

81
00:08:56,014 --> 00:08:58,687
What, are you going to set a fire?

82
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:02,807
By heart! Not by fire, son!

83
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:06,733
Aurel went to Orava!

84
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:11,052
Go and burn him! He has two more
mansions! Who are you going to harm?

85
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:16,373
They make the peasants rebuild every
mansion and farm that was set on fire!

86
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:21,283
They will not build it again! Tell them.

87
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:24,451
Whisper, give them advice at confession.

88
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:28,851
Burn hearts with hearts!
There is no prayer more beautiful!

89
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:33,487
Forgive me, Father, l know,
that you are with us.

90
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:36,207
Here!

91
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:39,964
Give it to the poor as they need.

92
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:43,086
Oh my God! l will not touch stolen money!

93
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:46,331
lt´s the money of the peasants!

94
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:57,684
l´ve sheltered her. Soldiers were trying to breakin
to her place twice already in the night.

95
00:09:57,734 --> 00:10:03,206
Jurko, if you only knew...

96
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:05,324
You should go away somewhere.

97
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:11,252
Dress up, Tereza. l will find a safe
place for you.

98
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:21,524
Protect her. She suffers for Jánošík´s bandits.

99
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:28,808
Be good, son.

100
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:56,051
Night has never been so short for me.

101
00:10:56,094 --> 00:11:02,408
Once... l wasn´t young anymore...
l was going with you.

102
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:07,767
l was dreaming. l was walking with
you on the lake.

103
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:12,569
l´ve never seen anything like it in my life.
A lake like from a fairy-tale.

104
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:18,610
We flew easily over the water.

105
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:20,053
l can not even tell.

106
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:26,090
Suddenly you caught my elbow and said:
Tereza, you are crying!

107
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:30,810
But l was not crying because
it was only a dream.

108
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:35,006
Now tell me what you want, or
otherwise l will really start crying.

109
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:38,649
But you know everything already.

110
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:44,252
l stray, seeking water like a thirsty stag.

111
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:50,813
Go alone. Give my greeting to Quail,
l am sending her the help l promised.

112
00:11:58,774 --> 00:12:00,765
Go!

113
00:12:24,854 --> 00:12:29,564
Give the cows to the people!
And the flour too!

114
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:32,686
We will, youngster!

115
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:36,443
lf you´ll meet soldiers, send them to us!

116
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:56,007
We should return to help them.

117
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:59,569
Don´t worry, captain.
My men are there!

118
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:02,412
We won´t put ourselves to shame,
six against six.

119
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:06,447
Well, that´s right.

120
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:13,251
Get out of the way of the provincial judge!

121
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:16,252
l wonder where should l step back.

122
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:18,603
Step aside, peasant worm!

123
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:21,248
Don´t be silly, you puppet,
they´re the count´s creatures.

124
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:24,889
How do you dare call me a puppet?

125
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:28,131
Don´t beat him!

126
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,324
Don´t beat in front of a provincial judge!

127
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:36,290
Bring him up! We will judge.

128
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:41,048
Who are you, father?

129
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:43,483
God´s son, my lord.

130
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:46,446
Well, we are all God´s children.
But whom do you serve?

131
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:49,850
l serve Jánošík, my lord.

132
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:53,011
Not really serving, but helping Jánošík!

133
00:13:53,054 --> 00:13:54,282
l don´t know him.

134
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,292
Youngster, my lord!

135
00:13:57,334 --> 00:14:03,682
He gave this into my hand and said,
bring the count´s flour to the people.

136
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:05,053
Put it away!

137
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:09,963
l will, l don´t even know, how to...

138
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:12,690
Hands up, lordly dogs!

139
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:15,971
Get down a get undressed. Move!

140
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:19,245
Get down from the horses, or l will
clean out your ears!

141
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:26,411
Nobody has ever kissed my hand in my
life, so if you could...

142
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:31,084
Move on, or l will make a sieve out
of you! Drop that gun!

143
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:35,929
This didn´t have to be...

144
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:44,733
l should die if this is not arrogance!

145
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:46,810
Just consider it, twenty cows!

146
00:14:46,854 --> 00:14:49,891
They steal twenty cows from you and
send you such a message!

147
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:55,327
One or two, but twenty!
l will feed a regiment with those!

148
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:57,968
When are they going to eat it?
What are they doing with it?

149
00:14:58,014 --> 00:14:59,970
You have it in that message, papa.

150
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:05,168
Thank you very much. We will give it
to the people. Signed Jánošík.

151
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:10,413
- Have you ever heard that name?
- l don´t remember.

152
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:11,853
Your majesty!

153
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:21,610
We, our property... Four of us stand
for the power of this province!

154
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,851
You four stand for nothing without soldiers.

155
00:15:24,894 --> 00:15:29,012
Stop it, property is concerned here!

156
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:35,289
The wisest thing to do is to offer a reward for
the head of that...

157
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,006
Jánošík.

158
00:15:37,054 --> 00:15:41,252
That is why l´ve called the provincial judge.

159
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:44,206
Judge knows better, let him give us advice!

160
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:49,453
Horrible! So much property!
Twenty cows!

161
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:54,363
We´ll call the lords, we´ll send out messengers,
we´ll summon a convention and...

162
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:58,373
But not into my house!
l won´t let them eat all my bread!

163
00:15:58,414 --> 00:16:01,531
We´ll go to the bishop.

164
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,927
He cannot keep the faithful in order,
so let him suffer!

165
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:08,002
This is not meant for your nerves.

166
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:10,045
Please, come in the boudoir.

167
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,891
Let´s rest a little bit.

168
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:14,653
The provincial judge comes!

169
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:17,083
Thank God! l am going to greet him!

170
00:16:18,454 --> 00:16:22,493
- You will see, the judge will find them.
- Whom?

171
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:25,731
- Your cows.
- How?

172
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:31,531
He can distinguish between a lordly
and a regular cow!

173
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,450
How?

174
00:16:32,494 --> 00:16:39,570
- ln fact, beef is beef.
- Yes, it is!

175
00:16:39,614 --> 00:16:42,412
Oh my God, where did this happen to you?

176
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:45,093
On a straight road.

177
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:48,888
They shaved me like this!

178
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:53,894
The chain is gone, the rings are gone!
They left me without a penny.

179
00:16:53,894 --> 00:16:58,092
They have me...

180
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:02,054
Bandits!
And they put this into my hand.

181
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,614
- Bandits?
- Attacking the provincial judge?

182
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:07,487
- And what happened with your soldiers?
- Gone...

183
00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:10,446
Maybe they are already hung on the trees.

184
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:12,928
- How dare they!
- What happened to the world we live in?

185
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:15,283
lt is horrible just to listen to it.

186
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,564
Jánošík again.

187
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:24,008
Clever man. At least he won´t rot as we will.

188
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:32,883
lt is a jay, not a hen!
Bring a bigger one!

189
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:35,767
Where should l get one?
You´ve already taken ten from me.

190
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:40,285
Don´t squawk! lf the lord prepares a
wedding, he can take a pig as well!

191
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:43,610
But he´s only preparing an engagement!

192
00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:47,488
lt doesn´t matter! Quiet!
Eggs there. Next!

193
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:51,812
Greedy peasants! Jánošík on you!

194
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:55,290
Jánošík? He doesn´t know about us

195
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:59,486
He will. Jánošík will learn
about everything.

196
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:05,134
- Why are you not taking it?
- That one is too thin!

197
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:08,365
Damn her ass, if she´s thin!

198
00:18:08,414 --> 00:18:10,609
Catch that goose, scoundrel!

199
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:29,246
We should sweeten up that wedding.

200
00:18:29,294 --> 00:18:31,728
At least eight count families will
gather there.

201
00:18:31,774 --> 00:18:35,005
So much drink and food.

202
00:18:35,054 --> 00:18:39,093
They will all have to pass under
Strecno to Pongrac´s mansion!

203
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:41,932
Every carriage will be followed by at
least ten soldiers.

204
00:18:41,974 --> 00:18:45,444
Not power, but wit will decide.

205
00:18:45,494 --> 00:18:49,726
All counts should be taken by the devil!
Aurel is lost somewhere!

206
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:52,652
He will come there!

207
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:57,165
One who gets Aurel,
can open a bottle of tokai!

208
00:18:57,214 --> 00:18:59,853
That´s the word! Let´s go!

209
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,810
l am going to meet Aurel,
bring the lords to the upper meadow!

210
00:19:30,854 --> 00:19:32,367
You can depend on me, captain!

211
00:19:53,414 --> 00:19:54,813
Take them!

212
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:57,846
Welcome, now you are all in the same boat!

213
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:04,648
Stop!

214
00:20:07,854 --> 00:20:09,526
Don´t scream, witch!

215
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:18,885
- They´re coming!
- Come on, start working!

216
00:20:37,454 --> 00:20:41,083
- You there! What is it?
- A hole. We are repairing.

217
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:43,648
Speed it up then, we´re in a hurry!

218
00:20:43,694 --> 00:20:46,447
We are too! But without any help,
it´ll take an hour or two...

219
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:48,371
Get down! Throw them those sticks!

220
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:55,009
And move on, so we won´t have to
stay here until the evening.

221
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:11,371
You face Hrajnoha!
Put it down and work!

222
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:24,249
Let´s go!

223
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:28,247
l don´t understand. We are going to a
wedding... calmly...

224
00:21:28,294 --> 00:21:36,247
l understand. Please, would you kindly
remember where count Aurel is?

225
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:41,368
ln my son´s carriage.
Somewhere behind us... over there!

226
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:47,245
More fires, Aurel.

227
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:49,645
Stop!

228
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:52,210
The horse!

229
00:21:52,734 --> 00:21:54,884
How much is a peasant in your region?

230
00:21:54,934 --> 00:22:00,167
- My father wants 500, l do 1 ,000 ducats.
- l´ve got two pipes loaded.

231
00:22:00,214 --> 00:22:04,127
- Easy math. You will pay me 3,000.
- Thief!

232
00:22:10,774 --> 00:22:14,528
- Sending my greetings to Jánošík!
- What a hero!

233
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:40,244
Run back home!

234
00:22:55,854 --> 00:23:02,407
Why did you... lie?

235
00:23:06,574 --> 00:23:10,647
How do they only tremble, porcelain
dolls... Move down!

236
00:23:10,694 --> 00:23:12,093
Gentlemen, be reasonable!

237
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:13,613
Are your legs petrified or what?
Get out of the carriage!

238
00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:16,373
Get down and run home!

239
00:23:16,414 --> 00:23:19,804
Be reasonable, gentlemen!

240
00:23:19,854 --> 00:23:22,971
Move up, puppet!

241
00:23:26,854 --> 00:23:31,086
Everything all right, only Aurel is lost.

242
00:23:31,134 --> 00:23:36,333
Oh, he isn´t lost! Come!

243
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:34,606
Don´t be scared, noble lordships!

244
00:24:34,654 --> 00:24:38,283
What you give up, you´ll give up to God,
you will see it no more!

245
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:39,767
Another count for offering!

246
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:43,011
Old lady and young Miss too,
give something to dowry!

247
00:24:43,054 --> 00:24:46,683
This is that devil that has stolen my pearls!

248
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:48,645
Don´t scream old one,
or you´ll get a bad throat!

249
00:24:48,694 --> 00:24:49,809
Come, we´ll take care of yo

250
00:24:49,854 --> 00:24:52,573
Scandal, that is such impertinence

251
00:24:54,774 --> 00:24:57,413
l do not wear jewels when l travel.

252
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,967
Clothes off!

253
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:02,927
- lt´s unnecessary, l´ll search myself.
- All right, search then.

254
00:25:07,654 --> 00:25:09,804
There you see!

255
00:25:09,854 --> 00:25:11,128
Next!

256
00:25:12,374 --> 00:25:17,323
Come on! Pants down! Next!

257
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:18,807
Try it once without your servant´s help!

258
00:25:18,854 --> 00:25:25,174
lf they kindly died, the dust on the ground
would be properly greased!

259
00:25:25,174 --> 00:25:29,611
- What about him?
- Cut his throat and fry!

260
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,605
You see!

261
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:40,526
Everything went smoothly, only one
soldier is dead.

262
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:41,927
Who killed him?

263
00:25:45,894 --> 00:25:49,091
Should l´ve waited for him to kill me?

264
00:25:49,134 --> 00:25:50,408
No, Gajdošík.

265
00:25:50,454 --> 00:25:55,448
We said that we´re going to loot,
not to kill!

266
00:25:55,494 --> 00:26:00,568
Choose good horses, burn the carriages
and send the lordships home on foot!

267
00:26:00,614 --> 00:26:05,165
What count Pongrác prepared for
these eaters, give it to peasants!

268
00:26:12,094 --> 00:26:19,170
l don´t need gold, silver,
not even a girlfriend.

269
00:26:19,214 --> 00:26:22,729
lf we only got wine more often.

270
00:26:22,774 --> 00:26:24,969
What is this going to be good for?

271
00:26:25,014 --> 00:26:28,245
Some of us should get married.

272
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:35,166
l would decorate his bride with this so
she wouldn´t be able to get to the altar.

273
00:26:35,214 --> 00:26:37,967
l would know what to do with my share.

274
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:40,687
l wouldn´t hang it on a woman.

275
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:41,928
Where would you find such a woman?

276
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:44,772
She´d look at you and her head would spin.

277
00:26:44,814 --> 00:26:47,374
She would dream of the devil for a month.

278
00:26:49,094 --> 00:26:52,450
Better, when a woman dreams of the devil,
than of gold!

279
00:27:01,254 --> 00:27:03,449
Tell them to stop!

280
00:27:03,494 --> 00:27:06,804
Let them be, we are not in a monastery.

281
00:27:06,854 --> 00:27:10,813
- We are catching mildew.
- Damn mildew!

282
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:13,607
Pairing season is approaching!
lt is always so.

283
00:27:13,654 --> 00:27:17,249
When the stags start to rut,
men smell women.

284
00:27:17,294 --> 00:27:22,971
They need to be let among people more often.

285
00:27:23,014 --> 00:27:27,166
l´m going for a scout. Rajcok
reported foreign merchants.

286
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:29,489
l will stay down the whole night.

287
00:27:29,534 --> 00:27:35,404
Skirts are best explored during the night!

288
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,888
And somebody will smash your mouth
during a bright day!

289
00:27:40,374 --> 00:27:44,765
Lads! They´ve stuck to us and now they...

290
00:27:44,814 --> 00:27:48,773
Quiet! The captain can do whatever he wants

291
00:27:48,814 --> 00:27:52,124
and decide however he wants! That´s
the rule in the mountains!

292
00:27:52,174 --> 00:27:55,325
Ohh, poo-poo you...! l blew up.

293
00:27:55,414 --> 00:27:58,486
lt is true! He has a girlfriend!
That´s where he´s going!

294
00:27:58,534 --> 00:28:00,843
And the his peasant´s shoes will shake!

295
00:28:00,894 --> 00:28:05,888
You should have warned him and
instead of it you... We didn´t do anything!

296
00:28:09,974 --> 00:28:15,606
- Gajdošík is...
- Our death!

297
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:20,250
l should have killed him long ago.

298
00:29:40,774 --> 00:29:42,890
Take the cows away!

299
00:29:45,854 --> 00:29:50,974
Mother, pick a cow,

300
00:29:51,014 --> 00:29:53,733
the count has four hundred of them!

301
00:29:53,774 --> 00:29:58,450
Flour like snow. l´ve dreamt about
such for years!

302
00:29:58,494 --> 00:30:02,043
One piece for each soul!

303
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:07,566
- Our captain gives everything away...
- The captain can!

304
00:30:07,614 --> 00:30:11,687
You were too and you kept it. l don´t want to be
in the mountains until the day l die.

305
00:30:11,734 --> 00:30:13,247
You need to save something as well.

306
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:17,048
Don´t grumble. You´ve promised on the
axe, so keep you mouth shut!

307
00:30:17,094 --> 00:30:18,766
Well, you get on with that oath!

308
00:30:23,534 --> 00:30:26,526
Listen, l will jerk out your guts right away!

309
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,848
Why are you scaring my children
in the night?!

310
00:30:27,894 --> 00:30:29,043
Oh, widow, don´t fuss!

311
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:31,767
Widow or not widow! Why do you sneak
around my yard in the night?

312
00:30:31,814 --> 00:30:35,011
We want to give you a cow.

313
00:30:35,054 --> 00:30:38,330
- Count´s cow.
- Just so?

314
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:41,332
Our captain is like that, he takes form the count,
gives to the poor.

315
00:30:41,374 --> 00:30:45,003
- And you are said to have a lot of kids.
- A lot? Only seven!

316
00:30:45,054 --> 00:30:48,364
Two cows go for seven.

317
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:51,053
Bring one more and bring a bag of
flour as well!

318
00:30:51,094 --> 00:30:53,289
Come on, Strakula...

319
00:30:53,974 --> 00:31:00,083
- And who is your captain?
- Juro Jánošík.

320
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:08,166
Our hope, God protect him!

321
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:11,254
God protect all of you, white falcons!

322
00:31:11,254 --> 00:31:15,213
Don´t bother me, or l´ll hurt you!

323
00:31:20,134 --> 00:31:24,764
Well, the goal is the most important.

324
00:31:24,814 --> 00:31:31,890
You take it like this, have a look
like this, and... boom!

325
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:36,132
Damn you, the powder is wet!

326
00:31:39,574 --> 00:31:43,089
Go away! Can´t you see that l´m on guard!

327
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:47,446
Father, you will make a hole in your stomach
sooner or later.

328
00:31:47,494 --> 00:31:50,327
Here you go, play with the axe!

329
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:54,890
And who shot the soldier?

330
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:59,366
Get off, youngsters!

331
00:31:59,454 --> 00:32:03,003
- What was it?
- The old man shot again.

332
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,965
- Jánošík isn´t back yet?
- No.

333
00:32:05,014 --> 00:32:07,323
lt´s hard to leave your girlfriend.

334
00:32:07,374 --> 00:32:11,925
- The emperor´s soldiers were here yesterday.
- Upon my soul.

335
00:32:11,974 --> 00:32:17,651
And everything rests on my head!
Call the elders!

336
00:32:17,694 --> 00:32:19,810
Krivy says: a lot of soldiers!

337
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:24,450
How many? A lot is twenty but
also two hundred!

338
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:28,965
l won´t leave my men to get beaten!

339
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:33,451
Or Krivy says: Merchant wagons come
from Silesia!

340
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:36,372
How many of them, he doesn´t know.

341
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:38,882
There is eight of those wagons,
Rajcok says.

342
00:32:38,934 --> 00:32:41,767
Forty imperials go with them on the road.

343
00:32:41,814 --> 00:32:44,965
We don´t know how many soldiers walk
through the mountains.

344
00:32:45,014 --> 00:32:47,244
Captain, don´t test your luck with that one!

345
00:32:47,294 --> 00:32:49,808
The emperor´s soldiers are killing on the spot!

346
00:32:49,854 --> 00:32:53,164
One who fears death,
dies every day.

347
00:32:53,214 --> 00:32:57,492
You can stay at home, we won´t be
splitting gold.

348
00:32:57,534 --> 00:33:01,049
l don´t mind, you can sleep.

349
00:33:01,134 --> 00:33:03,329
But you are not sleeping well.

350
00:33:03,374 --> 00:33:05,934
You are sleeping with the belt on
your belly since long time ago!

351
00:33:05,974 --> 00:33:07,373
Reach into it, father!

352
00:33:08,974 --> 00:33:13,729
Come on, he doesn´t have hot coal or
lizards in there!

353
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:17,562
Watch out, so you don´t poke your eye out.

354
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:24,252
Those are my beads!

355
00:33:26,414 --> 00:33:28,211
You joined the group,
bare-naked like a tree.

356
00:33:28,294 --> 00:33:30,888
Pearls grow behind your belt.

357
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:37,123
Father, will you buy us something
good to cook for that beauty?

358
00:33:37,174 --> 00:33:41,452
Don´t give it to father!
He´ll buy a ram again!

359
00:33:41,494 --> 00:33:45,009
lf he buys a ram, he´ll buy wine as well.

360
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:49,524
Did you hear, father? Wine.

361
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:52,532
So you know what to spend
those beads on.

362
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:55,452
- Oh well...
- Wine...

363
00:33:57,174 --> 00:33:59,324
- Where are you going?
- Away.

364
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:01,604
Good. You´ll go to scout with me.

365
00:34:01,654 --> 00:34:03,849
- You are commanding too much.
- l don´t like to.

366
00:34:03,894 --> 00:34:05,168
And suspect.

367
00:34:05,214 --> 00:34:08,650
Gajdošík is a bent man.

368
00:34:08,694 --> 00:34:12,972
But you shouldn´t have doubted him in
front of all. That won´t straighten him.

369
00:34:13,014 --> 00:34:16,245
lf you do not trust him, sack him!

370
00:34:16,294 --> 00:34:19,252
l don´t trust him and l won´t sack him!

371
00:34:19,294 --> 00:34:23,651
l let him go and tomorrow
we will all hang on a rope.

372
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:27,164
Whom of us do you trust at all?

373
00:34:28,374 --> 00:34:31,491
You the most, llcík.

374
00:34:31,534 --> 00:34:36,324
l´ve hurt you the most, and yet you
didn´t abandon me.

375
00:35:05,494 --> 00:35:09,248
- Do you know where are we going?
- Following our nose.

376
00:35:09,294 --> 00:35:13,810
- There is a tavern up there.
- l know. Tereza is up there.

377
00:35:13,854 --> 00:35:17,733
Everybody knows that. They are making
jokes, when you are gone for too long.

378
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:21,164
- Tereza helps up.
- lt depends.

379
00:35:21,214 --> 00:35:24,092
Don´t you dare or l´ll...

380
00:35:24,134 --> 00:35:27,809
Slowly... You wanted to say something
else.

381
00:35:27,854 --> 00:35:30,414
l love Tereza.

382
00:35:30,454 --> 00:35:35,767
l know better. She loves you.
So what do you want?

383
00:35:35,814 --> 00:35:39,727
- l feel blue.
- Kill yourself.

384
00:35:39,774 --> 00:35:46,964
Nothing hurts me anymore. l left home
to get over it faster.

385
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:51,212
- lt is all right now.
- Did you leave only because of that?

386
00:35:51,254 --> 00:35:58,842
Because of that too. Why to be in the way?
You belong to each other, since childhood.

387
00:35:58,894 --> 00:36:07,165
lf they´ll hang me, promise, that
you will take care of Tereza!

388
00:36:07,214 --> 00:36:10,331
Fool! They´ll hang us both!

389
00:36:34,454 --> 00:36:37,412
- Good morning, Terka!
- Good morning, boys!

390
00:36:37,454 --> 00:36:39,649
- Come on, feed the wolves!
- Welcome in here!

391
00:36:39,694 --> 00:36:42,731
Breakfast will be ready in a moment.

392
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:49,325
l don´t understand anything anymore.

393
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:53,447
Juro is a good man. He deserves you.

394
00:36:53,574 --> 00:36:56,213
Don´t be angry at me.

395
00:36:56,254 --> 00:37:01,931
l´ve spent many nights crying,
praying... nothing helped.

396
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:04,403
- Good morning.
- Oh, you are here already?

397
00:37:04,454 --> 00:37:08,049
- Good morning, bandit innkeeper!
- How many soldiers are following you?

398
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:10,364
We didn´t count them, Quail!

399
00:37:10,414 --> 00:37:15,044
Can you see them? They come only when
their girlfriends let them loose.

400
00:37:15,094 --> 00:37:18,006
They didn´t sleep, they´re hungry, thirsty...

401
00:37:18,054 --> 00:37:21,763
Because you are our sweetest.
With you, honey is sweet as well!

402
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:27,174
You rat, let go!

403
00:37:27,174 --> 00:37:29,529
l will give them oat as soon as l´ll
catch my breath again.

404
00:37:32,254 --> 00:37:33,733
Do l hear Jánošík?

405
00:37:33,774 --> 00:37:36,368
Yes, Granny. God bless you.

406
00:37:36,414 --> 00:37:38,052
- May God do it!
- Did you get up already?

407
00:37:38,134 --> 00:37:43,049
- l did. A long time ago.
- l´ve brought you something.

408
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,927
You shouldn´t have bothered.

409
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:47,692
Have some sweets.

410
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:51,966
- Oh God, gingerbread...
- And cake too.

411
00:37:52,014 --> 00:37:58,613
- Hawkie, how can l pay it back to you?
- You will say a prayer under my gallows!

412
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:00,884
Don´t blaspheme, son!

413
00:38:00,934 --> 00:38:04,768
- Good morning, Granny!
- llcík!

414
00:38:04,814 --> 00:38:07,806
- You guessed right.
- Quail, eat first and then go to sleep!

415
00:38:07,854 --> 00:38:09,492
We didn´t shut our eyes even
for a while this night!

416
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:14,369
As always. They only come snoring here!

417
00:38:14,414 --> 00:38:17,451
l have a young ram on the pan!

418
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:19,962
Oh my God! l am starting to shoot
rams from now on.

419
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:24,405
- l hear horses!
- That´s ours in the backyard.

420
00:38:24,454 --> 00:38:29,323
Not yours. Stranger´s horses!

421
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:39,451
We expected them for tomorrow.

422
00:38:41,414 --> 00:38:45,327
Don´t even think of starting
any fight in here!

423
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:01,484
Come on up, bandit innkeepers,
and cheerfully...

424
00:39:01,534 --> 00:39:04,492
Easy to say, be cheerful...
and l will burn.

425
00:39:19,414 --> 00:39:21,848
Captain Bucko with his company!

426
00:39:21,894 --> 00:39:24,886
We are waiting for you, Mister Bucko.

427
00:39:24,934 --> 00:39:27,494
l know, you are looking for Jánošík.

428
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:31,573
You are on a good track.
You´ll see him today.

429
00:39:31,614 --> 00:39:33,491
Finish, Mister! ldentify yourself!

430
00:39:33,534 --> 00:39:37,209
Free Mister Pulchre with his spy.

431
00:39:37,254 --> 00:39:39,449
Here is the seal of the provincial judge

432
00:39:39,494 --> 00:39:43,851
and here is my gun. Take it.

433
00:39:43,894 --> 00:39:46,044
Hand over your weapon and go out.

434
00:39:48,214 --> 00:39:53,163
Come with me. l have a provincial
order for you.

435
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:12,971
Trust for trust.

436
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:15,892
Five hundred ducats in gold.

437
00:40:19,014 --> 00:40:21,005
They can be yours.

438
00:40:21,054 --> 00:40:26,811
You have the soldiers,
l know where Jánošík is.

439
00:40:26,854 --> 00:40:30,688
But... it is very dangerous.

440
00:40:30,734 --> 00:40:34,249
My soldiers do not fear the devil himself.

441
00:40:34,294 --> 00:40:37,604
l would like to hear that from them.

442
00:40:37,654 --> 00:40:41,966
- Come here.
- What do you think about this?

443
00:40:50,374 --> 00:40:53,969
Who doesn´t want a hole in the
head, he shouldn´t stick it out!

444
00:41:05,094 --> 00:41:10,691
My llcík, where are you going to lay
you bones down?

445
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,532
ln your yard, Quail, l swear!

446
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:15,929
- My dear.
- l will wait for you by the road.

447
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:11,606
Oh my dear, l can see blood dripping
here soon.

448
00:43:26,414 --> 00:43:28,803
Martin, get the gun!

449
00:43:28,854 --> 00:43:33,450
Line the blanket up!

450
00:44:09,134 --> 00:44:12,524
Bow your heads, a wealthy merchant comes!

451
00:44:12,574 --> 00:44:14,565
And eleven servants follow him!

452
00:44:14,614 --> 00:44:19,642
- How much do you have in your pouch?
- Empty store, hungry servant and hungry lord!

453
00:44:19,694 --> 00:44:25,849
- Catch a coin for the beggar!
- Give my regards to Jánošík!

454
00:44:50,174 --> 00:44:53,007
- Greetings, journeymen!
- Salute, captain.

455
00:44:53,094 --> 00:44:56,928
Lure them into Vlcková,
we´ll cut them off there!

456
00:44:56,974 --> 00:44:58,805
We will, hay is already on the road!

457
00:44:58,854 --> 00:45:01,687
Don´t lose your heads, don´t kill anyone!

458
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:18,727
Squadron, forward with attacking gallop!

459
00:46:55,214 --> 00:46:59,492
Yield behind the merchant carriages!

460
00:47:57,054 --> 00:48:01,650
Grandfather, what´s up with you?

461
00:48:01,694 --> 00:48:04,731
- What happened to him?
- He´s probably been wounded.

462
00:48:04,774 --> 00:48:09,768
Poor man. What are we going to do
with him?

463
00:48:10,574 --> 00:48:18,162
- Move them!
- Courage, we´re on for a loot!

464
00:48:18,214 --> 00:48:23,846
Gee! Don´t fear the water, it´s only
up to a frog´s belly!

465
00:48:23,894 --> 00:48:28,843
What´s up with you?
Move them in the back there!

466
00:48:28,894 --> 00:48:32,807
Damn it! Move you feet!

467
00:48:32,854 --> 00:48:35,527
ln a line!

468
00:48:45,334 --> 00:48:47,290
Move those horses!

469
00:49:17,294 --> 00:49:20,650
Oh, bandits, cheerfully!

470
00:49:27,614 --> 00:49:32,210
And l´m walking here and there,
girls they miss me everywhere!

471
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:42,689
Hold me!

472
00:50:06,414 --> 00:50:10,327
Come on, you´ve been dancing enough,
come on!

473
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:14,049
We need a weight, and you are just right!

474
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,892
She can take as much as she weighs.

475
00:50:16,934 --> 00:50:19,050
Add some more!

476
00:50:27,814 --> 00:50:32,205
Dance, girl! Then l´ll kiss you!

477
00:50:32,254 --> 00:50:35,883
You can walk in such a shirt in the daylight!

478
00:50:35,934 --> 00:50:39,165
- l will come to show you!
- Then better in the night.

479
00:50:57,014 --> 00:51:04,489
Take it, women! l´ll give it all away
and add a turban to it as well!

480
00:51:08,934 --> 00:51:10,333
And what devil is this again?

481
00:51:17,694 --> 00:51:21,528
Watch it, bandit, it is flowing on the ground!

482
00:51:21,574 --> 00:51:25,886
Let it flow, the earth drinks gladly too!

483
00:51:27,054 --> 00:51:28,453
So generous!

484
00:51:28,494 --> 00:51:31,804
Three to Anka, four to Žofka!

485
00:51:33,334 --> 00:51:37,043
Fabric like a poppy!

486
00:51:47,614 --> 00:51:51,971
God bless you, son!

487
00:51:57,894 --> 00:52:01,773
Father Uhorcík... they got him.

488
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:31,849
They played nicely. They played
like this on my wedding.

489
00:52:31,894 --> 00:52:34,647
Quietly, or you will hurt yourself.

490
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:40,644
No, l will be going soon.

491
00:52:40,694 --> 00:52:48,692
l only came to thank, ask for forgiveness.

492
00:52:50,014 --> 00:52:55,008
Father, what´s up with you?

493
00:52:57,614 --> 00:53:01,971
Nothing, son, it is all right now.

494
00:53:02,014 --> 00:53:04,289
l will only rest for a while.

495
00:53:04,334 --> 00:53:08,532
Hold me tight.

496
00:53:08,574 --> 00:53:12,203
l will go easier.

497
00:53:16,654 --> 00:53:23,890
Brothers, say farewell cheerfully.

498
00:53:24,774 --> 00:53:29,290
Sing me a song for the journey.

499
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:33,930
My song, you know.

500
00:55:04,774 --> 00:55:09,689
What´s up with you, horse?
Are you sad too?

501
00:55:15,374 --> 00:55:20,129
Stop it, or l´ll go crazy.

502
00:55:20,174 --> 00:55:22,688
- What´s up with you?
- What´s up with me?

503
00:55:24,134 --> 00:55:26,489
l see a woman!

504
00:55:29,654 --> 00:55:34,205
- Look who´s coming to us!
- l´m hurrying down!

505
00:55:34,254 --> 00:55:37,291
- A girl like a lily!
- What a miracle!

506
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,529
Where did you find a doe like this?

507
00:55:39,574 --> 00:55:43,283
She says she´s with us, but she´d
bitten my fingers!

508
00:55:43,334 --> 00:55:46,132
Oh, a vixen! l bet she has green eyes!

509
00:55:46,174 --> 00:55:48,688
- l say they are sky-blue!
- Show at least one!

510
00:55:48,774 --> 00:55:51,049
Come on, womanizer, we will find the
way even without you.

511
00:55:51,094 --> 00:55:56,009
Lift your feet, sweetheart, one, the other...

512
00:55:56,054 --> 00:56:00,093
and now up with your behind!

513
00:56:02,934 --> 00:56:04,367
Nice girl.

514
00:56:07,574 --> 00:56:11,249
When you´ll go back, don´t miss us!

515
00:56:14,174 --> 00:56:18,053
Look under your feet, boys, or you´ll
go blind!

516
00:56:18,094 --> 00:56:21,643
Shut your eyes! The devil is sending us
a temptation.

517
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:28,213
Come here, men! A woman is here!

518
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:31,769
- Where? What?
- She fell from the heaven, lovely!

519
00:56:31,814 --> 00:56:34,612
Oh my eyes, don´t fail! l haven´t
seen a woman for half a year!

520
00:56:34,694 --> 00:56:37,731
Take me, girl! l will be carrying you
on my arms!

521
00:56:37,774 --> 00:56:39,492
And you can walk on my head!

522
00:56:39,574 --> 00:56:44,204
Whose are you, girl?

523
00:56:44,254 --> 00:56:48,088
Ours, Gregor. Welcome, Terka.

524
00:56:48,134 --> 00:56:49,886
Thank you.

525
00:56:50,654 --> 00:56:54,806
You didn´t have to blindfold her.
She is helping us.

526
00:56:54,854 --> 00:56:58,608
He did well. A woman doesn´t say only what
she doesn´t know. The best is a silent woman.

527
00:56:58,654 --> 00:57:01,168
- She is silent!
- Only when it´s necessary!

528
00:57:01,214 --> 00:57:03,444
She talks...

529
00:57:03,494 --> 00:57:04,927
What good have you brought us?

530
00:57:04,974 --> 00:57:07,852
A writing. For you, Jánošík, from the father.

531
00:57:10,374 --> 00:57:13,252
Don´t mess with it, bandit,
or you´ll get one.

532
00:57:13,294 --> 00:57:14,966
Listen what our father writes me.

533
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:20,407
The bishop has ordered me to expel you
from the church,

534
00:57:20,454 --> 00:57:27,053
deny you the last anointment
and a Christian funeral.

535
00:57:28,054 --> 00:57:31,490
lt´s bad. l cannot die.

536
00:57:31,534 --> 00:57:35,322
And l won´t, just to show the bishop.

537
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:40,165
Come, Terka, we will send him a letter.

538
00:57:44,614 --> 00:57:46,332
So, and you´re done with the lady!

539
00:57:46,374 --> 00:57:49,889
Girlfriends visit our captain right here.

540
00:57:53,734 --> 00:57:57,613
- She was cutting! - She should have
been cutting a long time ago.

541
00:58:00,334 --> 00:58:02,723
You will remember this!

542
00:58:04,134 --> 00:58:06,443
You will remember this!

543
00:58:08,814 --> 00:58:12,250
As l say, you need to catch them at sunrise.

544
00:58:12,294 --> 00:58:15,366
Not even a mouse can cross this hole.

545
00:58:15,414 --> 00:58:18,053
The forest is thick here, as a fur coat.

546
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:23,532
We need to come around Štrbánov hill
and below Gápel into the pass.

547
00:58:23,574 --> 00:58:28,329
They light fires on this and on that hill.

548
00:58:28,374 --> 00:58:33,573
And what if... you lie?

549
00:58:33,614 --> 00:58:39,803
You´ve promised one thousand ducats,
l´m not a dog!

550
00:58:39,854 --> 00:58:44,166
A traitor is worse than a mad dog.

551
00:58:55,454 --> 00:58:58,207
- ls it him?
- l think he knows something.

552
00:58:58,254 --> 00:59:01,929
Or he´s making a fool of you. He hasn´t seen
a bandit even in his dreams.

553
00:59:01,974 --> 00:59:03,851
Don´t give him a single penny.

554
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:09,045
Jánošík is in the town.

555
00:59:09,094 --> 00:59:12,166
This is what my soldiers found on
the parish gate.

556
00:59:13,454 --> 00:59:16,969
We will come to say a prayer.

557
00:59:17,014 --> 00:59:19,767
- What do you think about it?
- We will take over the church.

558
00:59:19,814 --> 00:59:24,285
Nonsense. They will not come to pray.

559
00:59:26,734 --> 00:59:29,043
Hold the town walls!

560
00:59:29,094 --> 00:59:33,610
Let this dog go and follow him.
A wolf returns to the wolves.

561
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:38,170
Free lord from Zochová
150 ducats in silver!

562
00:59:38,214 --> 00:59:42,366
Count Dolinay 1 ,000 ducats in gold.

563
00:59:42,414 --> 00:59:47,010
Count Cemicayi 500 ducats in silver.

564
00:59:47,054 --> 00:59:50,524
Count Lasicayi 300 ducats in silver.

565
00:59:50,574 --> 00:59:55,045
Penny-pinch, that Lasicayi.

566
00:59:55,094 --> 01:00:00,043
He drinks everything. And even
that they say he borrowed from a Jew.

567
01:00:00,094 --> 01:00:05,373
Count Révay 350 ducats in gold...

568
01:00:05,414 --> 01:00:10,169
Count Palucký 800 in silver!

569
01:00:10,214 --> 01:00:12,887
- They´ve been looking for you already.
- l haven´t missed anything.

570
01:00:15,414 --> 01:00:17,609
We will have Jánošík in chains in an hour.

571
01:00:17,654 --> 01:00:21,010
lf he stands there among the monks
then even sooner.

572
01:00:30,854 --> 01:00:35,928
Free lord from Folkušová
100 ducats in gold...

573
01:00:35,974 --> 01:00:40,365
Count Zahrayi 300 in gold...

574
01:00:40,414 --> 01:00:43,451
Count Boldayi 200 ducats...

575
01:00:44,014 --> 01:00:48,371
Have you seen how many lords came to
the Church?

576
01:01:04,614 --> 01:01:10,291
- Wait, we´ll go together!
- Follow me!

577
01:01:12,694 --> 01:01:16,323
Jánošík is in danger, somebody has to
warn him.

578
01:01:16,374 --> 01:01:18,490
Come, this way.

579
01:01:26,894 --> 01:01:28,964
Praise be to...

580
01:01:34,294 --> 01:01:36,489
Jánošík is in the Church!

581
01:01:36,534 --> 01:01:40,368
Brute, no, no!

582
01:01:40,414 --> 01:01:44,373
For the last time we assure the lordships,

583
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:50,967
that the money for the army to fight
the bandits, collected by us and sanctified

584
01:01:51,014 --> 01:01:57,567
will bring to your souls peace
and holy satisfaction.

585
01:02:09,134 --> 01:02:12,046
The silent brothers have brought
their offering.

586
01:02:14,454 --> 01:02:21,644
Welcome and accept our bishop´s blessing.

587
01:02:32,054 --> 01:02:39,642
We all come to this world in the same way
and leave in the same way as well.

588
01:02:39,694 --> 01:02:48,773
God did not divide people into
lords and beggars. That is what we wrote.

589
01:02:48,814 --> 01:02:52,773
But you state further on that we are
breaking God´s laws,

590
01:02:52,814 --> 01:02:55,408
although you know very well that we
do not loot for ourselves.

591
01:02:55,454 --> 01:03:02,530
That´s why we´ve decided to give
this collection too to the poor.

592
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:51,646
Rajcok saw Gajdošík in the town.

593
01:03:53,734 --> 01:03:56,453
We took the horses to the lower gate.

594
01:04:24,334 --> 01:04:31,251
Jánošík is in the town!
They´re after Jánošík!

595
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:43,690
Stop the bandits! Stop them!

596
01:04:43,734 --> 01:04:45,452
Ducats! Pick the ducats!

597
01:05:25,294 --> 01:05:26,773
Don´t shoot!

598
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:33,413
Put out the fire!

599
01:07:17,974 --> 01:07:20,772
Take the men through the pass to Polská.

600
01:07:20,814 --> 01:07:23,248
We will meet at Smerdžonka.

601
01:07:23,294 --> 01:07:28,322
With me llcík will stay and...

602
01:07:28,374 --> 01:07:31,332
- And me, captain.
- And you, Brute.

603
01:07:31,374 --> 01:07:33,524
Go prepare him.

604
01:07:38,734 --> 01:07:41,009
No need for such a hurry.

605
01:07:41,054 --> 01:07:45,764
Maybe Gajdošík didn´t have time to
tell them all.

606
01:07:45,814 --> 01:07:50,490
Nothing is moving so far.
Men by the fires are on their places.

607
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:52,365
What can happen to us...?

608
01:07:52,414 --> 01:07:55,565
Betrayal is worst than death.

609
01:07:55,614 --> 01:07:59,653
Today - tomorrow they´ll hit us,
there´s no way out.

610
01:07:59,694 --> 01:08:03,369
There is nothing to blame ourselves for
and nothing to promise.

611
01:08:03,414 --> 01:08:10,047
l know they won´t get a single
word from us and we´ll end up as men.

612
01:08:10,974 --> 01:08:14,489
Captain, we can resist.

613
01:08:14,534 --> 01:08:21,610
- Yes, captain.
- Come on, they´ve already dragged him out.

614
01:08:56,734 --> 01:09:09,534
He broke the bandit´s vow,
betrayed, killed, judge him, fellows.

615
01:09:20,694 --> 01:09:27,247
Friends, mercy!
l didn´t want to! They induced me!

616
01:09:28,134 --> 01:09:37,805
For God´s mercy!
Don´t shoot!

617
01:09:46,734 --> 01:09:50,488
Strengthen the guards and prepare
for the leave.

618
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:24,286
Protect us and help us, God, protect
us from all evil.

619
01:10:29,574 --> 01:10:32,088
Captain, you are responsible for his life!

620
01:10:32,134 --> 01:10:34,694
Kill the others without mercy!

621
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:38,886
You can depend on me, he won´t slip
Through my fingers this time.

622
01:11:01,334 --> 01:11:05,327
Get down! What is it? You´re stuck?

623
01:11:05,374 --> 01:11:11,085
- l forgot my pipe.
- Take mine! And move on!

624
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:22,850
- What´s up?
- Where are our fellows?

625
01:11:24,734 --> 01:11:26,326
On their heads!

626
01:11:34,934 --> 01:11:35,810
There he runs!

627
01:12:14,134 --> 01:12:16,125
lt was by the horses.

628
01:12:16,174 --> 01:12:19,007
Run down, see what´s going on.

629
01:12:33,534 --> 01:12:39,166
Stop!

630
01:12:55,774 --> 01:12:58,925
lt´s him! Don´t shoot!

631
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:01,329
Follow him!

632
01:14:37,734 --> 01:14:42,489
- Come here! There´s a hole over here.
- You better don´t stick your nose into it.

633
01:14:42,534 --> 01:14:45,571
Don´t worry, the rats have left the lair
long ago.

634
01:15:32,894 --> 01:15:35,089
Goodbye, sweethearts, see you in hell!

635
01:15:44,294 --> 01:15:46,205
Don´t shoot!

636
01:15:59,734 --> 01:16:01,452
Don´t shoot, fool!

637
01:16:20,334 --> 01:16:22,450
lnto them!

638
01:16:25,174 --> 01:16:28,132
Friends, shoot!

639
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:06,453
llcík, run!

640
01:17:08,494 --> 01:17:09,813
Come on, move up!

641
01:17:14,814 --> 01:17:25,213
Jesus Christ! llcík! My dearest boy!

642
01:17:25,254 --> 01:17:31,443
Who sent you to die here?

643
01:17:31,494 --> 01:17:40,209
Who killed you?

644
01:17:40,254 --> 01:17:53,770
l will kill the one...! Who did...
Murderers! Who?

645
01:18:42,294 --> 01:18:46,606
Jánošík

646
01:20:37,254 --> 01:20:38,448
Tereza!

647
01:21:14,134 --> 01:21:18,571
- Jánošík, give it up!
- No!

648
01:22:15,974 --> 01:22:17,168
Wait!

649
01:22:21,334 --> 01:22:28,172
Tell me where the stolen gold is
and l will save you!

650
01:22:28,214 --> 01:22:31,809
Only l can give you the emperor´s pardon.

651
01:22:31,854 --> 01:22:37,451
Speak, scamp, or you´ll be sorry!

652
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:41,089
l am sorry Aurel, that l haven´t
killed you long ago.

653
01:22:41,134 --> 01:22:44,046
l haven´t killed anybody,
but l should have killed you.

654
01:22:44,934 --> 01:22:49,007
- You dog!
- l can hear barking!

655
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:58,327
lf the count´s honor wouldn´t hold me back,
l would crush you like a cockcroach.

656
01:22:58,374 --> 01:23:05,485
- You are tiresome, Aurel!
- You will beg like a little child.

657
01:23:05,534 --> 01:23:07,809
Go now!

658
01:23:07,854 --> 01:23:12,006
The honorable judiciary arrives!

659
01:23:31,454 --> 01:23:34,207
The court of noble province proposes,

660
01:23:34,254 --> 01:23:38,327
since the offender didn´t reveal at the first
torture, where his looted treasure is

661
01:23:38,374 --> 01:23:41,366
nor the names of his company
has he disclosed,

662
01:23:41,414 --> 01:23:45,123
the court proposes that he should be
subjected to intense torture.

663
01:23:45,174 --> 01:23:47,483
l propose to start with the rack.

664
01:23:48,974 --> 01:23:49,770
Yes.

665
01:23:49,894 --> 01:23:51,964
With fire! Good.

666
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:54,769
With fire!

667
01:24:15,734 --> 01:24:20,046
Because he looted with many fellows,

668
01:24:20,094 --> 01:24:22,324
he encouraged the peasants
against the lords,

669
01:24:22,374 --> 01:24:25,491
he broke divine and secular laws,

670
01:24:25,574 --> 01:24:30,932
let him be hanged by his rib on a hook
as a warning

671
01:24:30,974 --> 01:24:35,286
and in fair torture left to his end!

672
01:24:35,334 --> 01:24:41,204
Such punishment will strike
all the helpers and supporters,

673
01:24:41,254 --> 01:24:45,247
every man or woman among the people,

674
01:24:45,294 --> 01:24:48,764
and young foolish boys,

675
01:24:48,814 --> 01:24:53,365
who would approve publicly of the actions
of the criminal Jánošík,

676
01:24:53,414 --> 01:24:56,963
or would spread legends about his lootings
in any way.

677
01:24:57,014 --> 01:24:59,130
Lord Almighty,
protect the young man!

678
01:24:59,174 --> 01:25:04,202
God Almighty,
have mercy on him!

679
01:25:04,254 --> 01:25:09,408
Hear him in front of your sight...

680
01:25:09,454 --> 01:25:15,802
Let him to your hearing as you
listen to our prayers.

681
01:25:31,174 --> 01:25:34,371
God Almighty, have mercy on him!

682
01:25:34,414 --> 01:25:37,894
Jánošík, listen for the last time!

683
01:25:37,894 --> 01:25:42,729
The emperor will grant you life,
if you will use the looted treasures

684
01:25:42,774 --> 01:25:47,086
to prepare an army against the rebels!

685
01:25:47,134 --> 01:25:52,208
For the last time! What is your
answer to the emperor?

686
01:25:55,334 --> 01:26:00,567
Tell him that he is not needed,
just like you.

687
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:03,970
Fires are burning on the mountains!

688
01:26:04,014 --> 01:26:08,326
Tell that to your emperor!

689
01:26:31,894 --> 01:26:36,331
Heads up, peasants! Life belongs to us!

690
01:26:36,374 --> 01:26:39,844
One day, the gallows will start blooming.
