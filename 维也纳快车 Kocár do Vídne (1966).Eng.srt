1
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:47,409
A man of country woman was hanged.
He didn't fight against anyone.

2
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,062
They killed him for warning,
he stole a few sacks of cement.

3
00:01:50,698 --> 00:01:53,889
She buried him the same
night, the front was coming,

4
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,081
who knows how long
would else they waited.

5
00:01:58,406 --> 00:02:01,423
Before dawn two soldiers
came into the house,

6
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:04,441
they didn't know what had happened.

7
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:12,242
They commanded to widow to.. horses to
coach and go with them. Yes, she said,

8
00:02:12,243 --> 00:02:19,005
it's the god sign. She prayed so she would have
strength to fullfill the justice.

9
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,038
Don't be afraid
You'll be alright,

10
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,511
I'm not a german.

11
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,593
I'm an austrian, from Vienna.

12
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,353
What's up?

13
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,468
Aha.

14
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,278
Machine gun! Fourtytwo...

15
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,398
Do you hear it?

16
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,158
Shit.

17
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,356
To the left! Go to the left!

18
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,152
No!

19
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,916
To the left!

20
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,469
Here, to the grass.
Do you understand?

21
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,037
It won't make any noise here.

22
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,359
Where is Znojmo?

23
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,952
Do you understand?

24
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,471
Znojmo.

25
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,071
How many kilometers?

26
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,190
Fourty? Fifty?

27
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,757
Hold..

28
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,236
Are you mad?

29
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,119
Let me do it!

30
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,759
- As soon as you're supposed to shoot, I'll give it to you.
- Give me the gun.

31
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,395
Don't be afraid, I'll give it to you.

32
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,753
- Do you know who you are?
- Lie calmly.

33
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,431
You're swine! Common swine.
And you look like a jew!

34
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,553
What are you staring at?
Go on!

35
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,191
Hold!

36
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,157
He's ill...

37
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,631
Heavy wounded.

38
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,038
Why aren't we moving?

39
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,832
What's up with the horse.

40
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,671
How big is the forest?

41
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,191
Aha.

42
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,518
Wait!

43
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,036
Moment.

44
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,272
One or two?

45
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,871
I should be a countrymen.

46
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,078
I think I would be a good countrymen.

47
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,870
How do you name it in czech?

48
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,277
Ten minutes break!

49
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,712
Good taste!

50
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,431
Thanks!

51
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,437
Go on!

52
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,511
Bells

53
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,352
Bells

54
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,794
Bim bam, bim bam...

55
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,475
Hitler is dead!
War is over!

56
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,753
Bim bam.

57
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,712
Gunthere!

58
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,869
War is over.
Do you understand?

59
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,119
All is over.

60
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,030
To the Osterreich.

61
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,878
My mum.

62
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,072
Mama.

63
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,152
My father

64
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,070
brother...

65
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,156
We live here.

66
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,116
My girl

67
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,270
Anna.

68
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,631
The ring is from her.

69
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,716
Are there bandits in the forest?

70
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,151
Ano?

71
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,473
Speak!
Partizans...

72
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,598
Don't worry.

73
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,878
Is someone here?

74
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,072
Here...?

75
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,110
Also not?

76
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,790
Here it has to fit.

77
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,158
It's narrow, I understand.

78
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,277
The chain! Of course!

79
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,272
The chain and the horses
and then hee...

80
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,390
Great!

81
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,272
And now Znojmo.
What city is it for?

82
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,596
We have to go to Znojmo quickly.

83
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:09,718
We have to go to the first austrian village.

84
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,031
Do you understand?

85
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,511
Are we going well?

86
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,553
Znojmo.

87
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,955
If we see Russians, then quickly away.

88
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,228
It is terrible cold in the siberia.

89
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,591
It's yours.

90
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,070
It's yours.

91
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,591
Good clock, made from gold!

92
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,711
All is gold!

93
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,511
For you

94
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,197
I don't want it!

95
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,031
Everything for you! It's yours!.

96
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,956
Take it!
Don't be ashamed!

97
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,437
Weak.

98
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,198
>Thanks!

99
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,757
Are you sick?

100
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,078
Do you want to drink?

101
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,597
I was riding horses in Prater at ours too.

102
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,957
It was on sunday,
who paid, could ride.

103
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,590
I took with me my mother.

104
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,748
She was afraid, but I rode well.
Like the right postillion.

105
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,478
On the left or on the right?

106
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,631
There or there?

107
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,956
Ok, go on.

108
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,799
I've always been lucky.

109
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:17,070
Even in the school,
I got of everything.

110
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,159
I shouldn't talk you over.

111
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,752
You didn't.
I wanted to desert myself.

112
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,119
- What's the name of the city?
- Znojmo.

113
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,878
Znojmo...

114
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,237
Do you know I've never been to country?

115
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,509
First in Russia and there...
in Poland.

116
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,356
Where is my gun?

117
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,388
Next to you...
you don't need it now.

118
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,279
Try to sleep.

119
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,678
War is over.

120
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,110
There were ringing bells
and music played somewhere.

121
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,910
From some village.

122
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,517
It's the second or third may today?

123
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,835
Third.

124
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,033
On the third may didn't ended any war...

125
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,714
The thirty years war ended
at 24th may,

126
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,949
Prussia-Austrian war
ended 22nd Juli.

127
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,639
French-Prussia
26th February.

128
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,514
The world war

129
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,793
on 11. 11.at 11.

130
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,951
Where is the gun?

131
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,878
- Fuck the gun.
- I would like to have it by myself.

132
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,152
- Don't you have it in the bag?
- No, I've took only ammo.

133
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,236
Why is she staring at us?

134
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,952
I don't know.
Maybe I've got it in the bag finally.

135
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,397
You didn't give her the watch?

136
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,158
You have to know
that you took my gun.

137
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,872
I don't look for the gun.

138
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,157
Do you think she really doesn't know german?

139
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,870
- Not a word.
- How do you know?

140
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,599
I tried to speak with her.
But she understand a shit.

141
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,270
All russian women are whores.

142
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,279
You can't figure out what...

143
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,076
Have you sleep all time?

144
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,073
What time is it?

145
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,598
Almost four...

146
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,276
Look at the trees and the crust.

147
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,069
We're heading to north.

148
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,312
- Where is my compass?
- Give me at least the bayonet.

149
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,720
Give me it to the hand!
Do you hear?

150
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,677
Don't worry!

151
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,512
Hold!

152
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,276
Get up!

153
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,758
Get up!

154
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,275
Hold or I'll shoot you.

155
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,075
One, two...

156
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,956
What do you think, swine.

157
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,317
Don't go near her!
Tell her to turn out.

158
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,676
Shit, tell her to raise her hand.

159
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,952
Hands up!

160
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,310
You haven't loaded.

161
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,750
Down! Quickly!

162
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,556
Back up!

163
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,512
She has a bag under chair.
Can you reach it?

164
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,190
Back up!

165
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,951
Where have you put the gun?

166
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,948
Shoot her...

167
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,593
Where have you put the compass
and the bayonet?

168
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,474
Don't let the hands down.

169
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,073
Wait.

170
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,198
Take of your coat.

171
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,358
Will you?

172
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,392
One..

173
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,676
two...

174
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,796
She throw all away.

175
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,473
And she would like the rifle
to throw away too.

176
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,155
Move! The skirt too!

177
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,750
Shoot her, bitch...

178
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,274
Let's loose her. Go!

179
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,478
Why can she go? Are you mad?

180
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,709
Go!

181
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,591
Go home!

182
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,396
Jesus..

183
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,034
Help!

184
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,077
- She's gone.
- Do you think?

185
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,916
I don't see anything.

186
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,913
If she... bitch.

187
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,556
Accomodation prescription
for occupied area excludes

188
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,556
Don's speak! It exerts you.

189
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:54,278
In the Ukraine and similar
shit holes...

190
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,558
to be under one roof with
local civilians.

191
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:09,195
The bitch is after us, remember.
She has russian eyes.

192
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,037
She's gone long time ago.

193
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,757
When we'll be out of this forest?

194
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,948
Aren't we go out of it after all?

195
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,074
We'll go.

196
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,715
Be quiet, please!

197
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,274
Hold!

198
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,918
Wait a moment please.

199
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,278
Go home!

200
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,110
Go or I'll shoot you!

201
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,472
Gunthere?

202
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,395
Gunthere! Gunthere!

203
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,316
Please, shoot me!

204
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,870
Don't scream!

205
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,397
She never wanted me to go to forest.

206
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,671
Could she know?

207
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,951
We'll be outside soon.

208
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,590
Quicker! Run!

209
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,432
Hello?

210
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,752
Hello?

211
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,072
Come here.

212
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,593
Is someone here?

213
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,830
You can take the horses.
And the coach too.

214
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:15,030
Money and other stuff
is on the couch.

215
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,476
My pal is dead.

216
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,952
Take all.

217
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,592
Thanks.

218
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,552
Brave horses.

219
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,271
You won't kill anyone anymore.

220
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,356
Neither me.

221
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,349
Do you see me?

222
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,119
Mum?

223
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,958
Mummy!

224
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,316
German..

225
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,671
Do you hear?

226
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,831
Don't you understand what am I saying?

227
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,598
Get up!

228
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,795
Get up! Up!

229
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,951
Get up! Get up!

230
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,160
I'll kill you like a dog!

231
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,873
Like a dog!

232
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,311
Go away!

233
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,910
Go away, rascal!

234
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,751
Not there. There!

235
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,755
There is your Osterreich!

236
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,835
What do you want? Go away!

237
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,199
What are you waiting for?
A judgement day?

238
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,751
Don't stare! Go!

239
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,918
Don't cry.

240
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,157
Do you want some more?

241
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,837
It's still here.

242
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,551
War is over.

243
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,436
It's fourth of May.

244
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,472
On the fourth of May there were
Beijing's events,

245
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,960
Bourbon restoration,

246
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,358
decret about working time...

247
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,672
and my brother was born.

248
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,949
For a memory...

249
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,232
Do you understand?

250
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,631
Hans...
It's my name.

251
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,152
Go away, german.

252
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,676
No, german.

253
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,232
Shit.

254
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,960
Geez. Could I erase them?

255
01:11:58,995 --> 01:12:01,520
Could I erase the Hitler and the bitch?

256
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,474
Imagine, they're asleep.

257
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,555
Like there is no big deal.

258
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,636
Is he a SS man?

259
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,473
He cut off everything.

260
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,552
Even buttons.

261
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,511
Geez, they're...

262
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,757
they're here...

263
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,794
Do you believe it's possible?

264
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,873
And we fight.

265
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,033
What's up?

266
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,435
- Go on.
- Careful, bitch.

267
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,511
Please, sirs, I'm innocent.

268
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,278
- Shut up.
- Ruhe!

269
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,157
There was no point in torturing him.

270
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,550
Finally, we are not nazi.
