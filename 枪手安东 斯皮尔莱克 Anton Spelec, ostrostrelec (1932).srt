Featuring

7
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,360
- Wait, wait!

8
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,760
That F sharp again.

9
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,680
Take it up...
Higher...

10
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,840
- Boss, could I have some help here?

11
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,640
- Looks like I'll help you myself.

12
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,800
- So, come on now!
- Get up!

13
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,120
- Ah, our Emperor was born!

14
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,400
- Tony, where are you,
for God's sake?

15
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,160
All that splendor,
and you're not there!

16
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,080
We all are already standing there!

17
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,440
- My, I forgot all about it.

18
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,960
- You have to be there.
I'm not supposed to tell you, but -

19
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:21,560
just between us,
you are awarded a medal today.

20
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,320
- You're having me on...
...Kacaba, if it is not a true...

21
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,520
- Tony! It's true.
- Is it?

22
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:42,400
- Five medals were proposed.
You were named later as the sixth.

23
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,120
Shhh...

24
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:59,040
- Tereza, you are my wife.
I'm not saying anything.

25
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:09,520
But when I come back from the show,
notice my chest. Let's go.

26
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,960
- The medal-awarding ceremony
of the Sharpshooter Guards

27
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,880
will now begin.

28
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,840
Sobotka Frantisek,
Rais Cyril,

29
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,600
Stanek Jan,
Cafourek Vaclav,

30
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,440
Kautsky Josef.

31
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,160
- And what about me?
Why did you say that for?

32
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,480
- And... Hooter Anton.
- Here!

33
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,840
- Most respected Commander,
the medal I get today

34
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,280
will be my pride and joy...
Wait. My heart is..., no.

35
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:45,160
I am overjoyed... I am honored...
Dear Sir, I am...

36
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,440
- What's wrong,
what about the medal?

37
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,240
- That man was awarded subsequently.

38
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,560
- Seems they didn't put it through in time.

39
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,320
- Yes, yes, yes...

40
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,760
- Mr. Hooter, I'm very sorry, you'll get it
at next year's ceremony.

41
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,400
- Stand at attention!

42
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,680
Company, take aim!

43
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,800
Company, left turn!
Forward march!

44
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,480
- Such a disgrace!

45
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,600
What a fool I look now.
All those people watching.

46
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,520
All the neighbors sniggering.

47
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,040
If I don't get the medal, this is my end.

48
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,720
Such great expectation,
all miscalculation.

49
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,960
Short of one they must be -

50
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,080
just when one's meant for me!

51
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,720
I've felt hot and cold and hot,
do I get it or not.

52
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:48,320
Should I ever be born again,
I'll flush myself down the drain.

53
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,600
Anton Hooter, Sharpshooter,

54
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,040
when he screams for liquor

55
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,000
and the devil gets into him

56
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,360
the results are pretty grim.

57
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,880
Now I can but rant and rave,

58
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,240
that damned medal will be my grave.

59
00:11:39,040 --> 00:12:04,800
- Beer! Beer! Beer!

60
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,680
- Come on, Tony,
be sensible.

61
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,720
You'll get the medal next year.

62
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,160
- What next year?

63
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,480
I should have had it today!
If they don't want to give it to me,

64
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,360
I'll tell them what to do with it.

65
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,840
- Tony...
- I'm right.

66
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,560
- Stop shouting.
Be a man and have a beer.

67
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,360
- I don't want beer, don't force me.

68
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,760
I want liquor! Liquor!

69
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,320
- Tony, keep away from the liquor,

70
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,200
you know what it does to you.

71
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,960
- You stop preaching.
You've got the medal, I haven't.

72
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,600
Liquor!
You, decorated!

73
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,680
- What's ma'am making for lunch?

74
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,840
- What? Pasta.

75
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,440
I'll let you have mine for 8 halers.
I'll do with soup.

76
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,760
- Deal then.
One gets hungry working.

77
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,360
- You do nothing!

78
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,120
What if by chance I did.
Am dying for a drink.

79
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,200
- Liquor!

80
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,640
- Tony, don't! You get berserk!

81
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,760
- I get... nothing.
- Tony, please!

82
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,920
- Don't worry.
I am always OK.

83
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,440
No medal for me?
Me, the best of 'em all!

84
00:13:49,760 --> 00:14:01,160
Me, like a Don Kossack with a gun!

85
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,640
Most honored gentlemen,
would you like a display?

86
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,120
All right then, watch.

87
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,480
See? Just one flash.

88
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,080
- Jesus Christ!
- Now some real shooting.

89
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,440
- Tony, for God's sake, be sensible!

90
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
- What sense?
- What are you up to?

91
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,360
- I'm going to fire!
- Don't!

92
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,000
- Just one shot!
- See where you liquor gets you!

93
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:12,360
- But I want to!
- Be sensible!

94
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,400
- I'll fire, look!
- Don't!

95
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,000
- I'll dance a Kossack dance, then.

96
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,880
Mind, I'm going to fire!
- Don't!

97
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,520
- I am!
- Tony!

98
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,520
- Nice bang, what?

99
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,760
- I want order in here!

100
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,760
- Order yourself!

101
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,800
If you want order,
see to it I get my medal!

102
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,280
With your education,
you should know.

103
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,000
- Don't shout, the Commander...

104
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,280
- Damn the Commander! He's a fool!

105
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,720
- It's not the Commander's fault!
- Whose, then?

106
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,800
- The Emperor's!
- Frankie? That fool?

107
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,120
- He means Frankie the glazier!
- No, not the glazier.

108
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,560
The ruler - he's crazier!

109
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:28,400
The Emperor's a fool!
Here we go.

110
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,000
- Tony, go and apologize, please.
They'll hang you for that!

111
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,160
- Think so?
- Go on.

112
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,960
- Apologize to him?
- Go!

113
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,240
- I don't want to,
but if you wish...

114
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,560
Sir, I beg to report,
that we were over-hasty

115
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:02,840
and said the Emperor's a fool.
We take that back and proclaim,

116
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,040
that the Emperor's not a fool,
but a crowned fool!

117
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,080
Here we go.
- You've insulted the Emperor!

118
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,080
- I didn't say anything.
Insulted nobody.

119
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,120
Named nobody.

120
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,320
- You comedian!

121
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:37,680
- Now he's insulted me!
I won't tolerate that!

122
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,360
When I say three, the scrimmage starts!

123
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,320
Three!

124
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,480
- Get a razor!
- Forget about a razor!

125
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,640
- Who's biting me?
- Hand me the razor!

126
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,800
- You'll pay for this insult!

127
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,520
- You'll pay for this insult!

128
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,960
You've insulted His Imperial Majesty...
...Franz Joseph I.

129
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:10,560
Considering all circumstances,
according to Paragraph 63,

130
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:18,320
the Court sentences you
to three months' imprisonment.

131
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,640
Defendant, do you accept the sentence?

132
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,720
- Excuse me...
- Wait! Wait! Wait!

133
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,640
Most respected Court,
as my forespeaker clearly hinted,

134
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,280
this seems to concern my imprisonment.

135
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,080
This proposal is against my convictions.

136
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Most respected Court of Law,

137
00:19:50,800 --> 00:20:00,760
if I said the Emperor is a foo...
I mean ruler... let me go on.

138
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,560
Most respected Law of Court,
what about another solution?

139
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,280
What if Mr. Kacaba, here present,
my life-long witness,

140
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,080
at my wedding, too,

141
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:20,080
guaranteed on his word of honor,

142
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,720
That, let's say,
I'd do my time at his house?

143
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,840
- I cannot take this responsibility,
Your Honor.

144
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,440
- Defendant, I ask you again
if you accept the sentence.

145
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,560
- Couldn't it be probationary, please?

146
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:56,240
- The sentence is unconditional.
- And what if I write it out

147
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,000
a hundred times
and let it signed at home?

148
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,240
Ah, that's not go, either.

149
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,400
No amnesty applies to me?
- Mr. Prosecutor...

150
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,880
- You have perpetrated the crime
of insulting His Majesty, Paragraph 63.

151
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,280
You are found guilty.

152
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,840
I advise you
to accept the sentence.

153
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,320
- Listen, I've been watching you.

154
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,080
I think you have a down on me!

155
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,040
Anyway, most respected courts and laws,

156
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,720
three months is too much
for such a little act of rashness!

157
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,360
I'm willing to prove...
- I would like to...

158
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,520
- You sit down, you stutterer.

159
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,680
Before you squeeze it out,
I'll be out of jug again.

160
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,800
- Had they let him off for the Emperor
thing,

161
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,840
Frankie could make charges.
So what's the odds?

162
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,200
How much d'you think he'll get?

163
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,600
- What can he get...
The rope.

164
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,760
- You stop it.
I haven't slept for two weeks.

165
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,080
- To the shop!

166
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:40,080
- Tony, how did you make out?
Acquitted...

167
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,760
- I knew you would be.

168
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:51,000
- In three month's time.
- Heavens, three months!

169
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,960
- That's the result.

170
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,840
That's for having such a friend
stand witness for me.

171
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,840
- But, Tony, please...
- Don't!

172
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,880
As soon as we got there,
you asked the porter for a drink.

173
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,920
- Half a day's work lost...

174
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,760
- But you were my witness!

175
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,760
I was nearly out of it
when they asked him

176
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,360
what religion he confessed.

177
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,000
And he said Greek-Roman!
That's a fight, you!

178
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,520
- See, now I'm to blame.

179
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:41,680
At the pub I kept telling him:
Tony, please, stop drinking,

180
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,800
you know what you get up to.
But no.

181
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,720
He kept shouting: Liquor! Liquor!
And: The Emperor's a fool!

182
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,360
- See! And nobody charges him!

183
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,720
- Don't tell me, Mr. Kacaba.
You wanted some drink and fun.

184
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,600
Why did you drag him to the pub?

185
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,080
- Exactly, why did you?
- Tony, don't. You made ME go!

186
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:21,200
- Liar! You said let's skip the march,
have a drink!

187
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,840
Of course you did.

188
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,160
Look here.

189
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,440
...with one fast.
I hadn't noticed this.

190
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,800
One fast what?

191
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Where shall I get the fast?
See what you've done!

192
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,120
- Mr. Kacaba,
do not bother my husband again.

193
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,120
- But why?
- Right, absolutely right.

194
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,160
You always get me into trouble.

195
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,000
Yes, you do.

196
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,520
The way you speak of her and all.
I'll tell my wife.

197
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,880
The way you speak of the whole family.

198
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,720
Do you know what he said?
Let her know.

199
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,760
He said you ate a dog.

200
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,040
- You said that?
Out of here!

201
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,320
- Yes, out, says my wife.
- But Tony...

202
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,000
- Leave the room, please!

203
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,680
- And old friend...

204
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,760
- None of old friends.
Excuse me...

205
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,000
Cannot tolerate your behavior!

206
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:12,440
- Three months in prison are bad,
but there are worse things.

207
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,360
- Worse, indeed!
Do my time for me!

208
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:31,440
- Tony, I have an idea! What if
somebody did it for you?

209
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,520
- Heavens, and who?
- Someone who can hold his tongue!

210
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,240
- I have yet to meet such a guy!
What an idea! - Yes, great idea!

211
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,280
If you're away for there months,
we can close the shop.

212
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:55,600
What would you do then?
- What would you do?

213
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:07,760
I've got an idea!
What if somebody did it for me?

214
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,000
- What did I say?
- What?

215
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,760
- Someone else
may do your time for you.

216
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,760
- Good idea!

217
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
- Good idea, Alois.

218
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,640
The old man'll be locked-up,
and they'll need us here badly.

219
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,960
- You'll give him your papers,
and he'll go to prison for you.

220
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:40,800
- Impossible.
Such a man won't fall from the skies.

221
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,640
Come in!

222
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,920
- Good afternoon.
- Mr. Cuckoo.

223
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:58,880
- We thought, boss...

224
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,280
Now you'll be traveling to prison

225
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,120
we'll be kept busier
and you should give us a raise.

226
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,000
- Hey, wake up!
- Why?

227
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,720
- You're talking in your sleep!

228
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,000
- Oh no, boss.
I know what I'm saying.

229
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:27,400
For those three months
we'd want our pay in advance.

230
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,680
- Look here, Cuckoo.

231
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,040
I have a clean record,
I've never hurt a soul.

232
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,520
Scram now,
or I'll make such a mess of you,

233
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,200
that I'll be back sooner from jail
than you from hospital.

234
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,160
Out!

235
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,960
- So three months ain't enough?

236
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:50,200
- Get me my rifle,
I'll brand him with the Imperial emblem!

237
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,960
- Don't shout, Tony, please!

238
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,040
- I can shout, I am the boss!

239
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,240
I am in trouble
and up pops such a vampire

240
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,880
trying to bamboozle money out of me!

241
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,720
- You never know,
he may come in handy.

242
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840
- Like a pain in the neck.

243
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,520
- Tony, sit down.

244
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,440
What if he took your place in prison?

245
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,320
- It would serve him right.
Do you think he'd do it?

246
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,760
- He'd do anything for money.

247
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,200
I'll fetch him, but be nice to him.

248
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,120
If you need him,
you have to butter him up!

249
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,880
- And spread him on my bread for joy.

250
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,480
- I don't need this.
Can get a job with the railway.

251
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,960
Want my supper for six kreutzers?

252
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,840
- Mr. Cuckoo!
Joe dear!

253
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,240
- Just look at her, all velvet.

254
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,520
- My husband wants a word with you.

255
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,280
- Yeah, this could work.

256
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:05,160
Twenty gold pieces...

257
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,360
Not bad.

258
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:15,600
A deal... Twenty gold pieces
for going to jail for me.

259
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,080
- Here is Mr. Cuckoo.

260
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,760
- I'm so glad you came, Cuckoo,

261
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,960
you're such a sweet man.

262
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,400
Just come in,
sweet honey Cuckoo!

263
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,240
Do take a seat, Cuckoo!

264
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,520
That clock must go!
We can't let if offend our guest!

265
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,920
Sit in the soft chair,
you'll get enough of hard benches.

266
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,600
- Pardon?

267
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,520
- Bring some liquor!
You do drink, Cuckoo?

268
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,920
Of course you do.
Minor man is our man.

269
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,440
How are you doing, man?

270
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,080
- Nothing much...

271
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:10,560
- Nothing. And I pay you for it.
See what a great fella I am.

272
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,920
There, Cuckoo, you're a guest.

273
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,080
You know I always meant well by you.

274
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,640
This is for you,
and this is for me.

275
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:30,000
I have to, you know.
Which one, this one.

276
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,800
Well, my dear Cuckoo.

277
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,240
Do help yourself.

278
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,440
The point is this.

279
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:51,760
I am opening a branch shop.
Great spot, really something.

280
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,680
I shan't tell you where and so,

281
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:02,760
but you'll have a nice rest there.
I wouldn't say so if it weren't true.

282
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:08,000
Bring the cake for the guest
and get some cigarettes.

283
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,280
Do you smoke?
Feel free and smoke.

284
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,640
I need a representative for three months,

285
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,960
at that branch shop.

286
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,800
Director, you know?
- Understand.

287
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,840
- You keep mum about it,

288
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:33,720
just take my place...

289
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,680
Understand?
- Yeah..., I do.

290
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,800
- Are you drinking?
Just another drop.

291
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:47,080
- I can't...
- You could if you tried, Cuckoo.

292
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,760
- No, it's too strong...

293
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,240
- See, where there's a will there's a way.

294
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,400
Are the cigarettes here?
- Here.

295
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,120
- Come and sit down, then.

296
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,120
So I'll tell you, Cuckoo.

297
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,720
- I'll tell him myself.
- I'll tell him.

298
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,080
Look, Cuckoo...
- I know.

299
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,520
- I can't...
- Go to prison for three months.

300
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,480
Could you do it for him?

301
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,320
- Understand, Cuckoo?

302
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,960
- We wouldn't want it
for free, of course.

303
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,840
- Wait, don't force him.
What if he wants to do it for free?

304
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,160
Look how well he looks,
he's gained weight in our house!

305
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,280
Our little angel - you little angel.
What a nice guy.

306
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,360
Look, such a chubby-face.
- Yeah, chubby-face.

307
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,800
- You were out.
You don't know he offered

308
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,120
to go to prison for me.

309
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,680
- What?
- You did. Yeah, you did.

310
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,240
- I'd have to think it over.

311
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,520
- Look, Cuckoo, it's simple.
No thinking.

312
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,680
You take my documents
and go there,

313
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:09,160
ring for the porter,
then go to the director's

314
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,720
sign your name in the guest book,

315
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,320
they take you on,
and that's that.

316
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,320
And it's with full board, too!

317
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,160
Didn't I tell you?

318
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,240
And there's more...

319
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,160
You'll learn all about stationery,
sticking paper bags!

320
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,680
Or learn to play the violin,
there were such people.

321
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,000
You'll manage overnight!

322
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,360
You know your way around.

323
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,120
- But what's in it for me?
- I worked it out. - Yeah.

324
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,680
- But what's in it for me?
- I worked it out. - Yeah.

325
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,720
- We'd give you 20 gold pieces.
- Twenty gold pieces.

326
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,080
- For three months. So, look...
- Twenty, that's a nice bit of money.

327
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,200
- You see, nice money.
- But three months...

328
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,760
- For just three months, it is great.
- Three months, that's a long time!

329
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:22,200
- I know, but if you took February,
it would be shorter.

330
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,320
- Mr. Cuckoo, please do it.
- Look, we'll give you thirty.

331
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,240
- Forty, if you say, then agreed.

332
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,160
- Who's doing the bidding?

333
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,920
- Twenty now, twenty when you're out.

334
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,800
- When you come back from jail.

335
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,280
- Criminal.
- We call it jail.

336
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,440
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You know?

337
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,880
- Twenty now.
And she can give that to me now.

338
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,520
- Yeah, give it to him.

339
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,600
- OK. Twenty now and twenty after.

340
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:04,440
And boss, what about social security?

341
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,000
- I pay everything.
- You pay.

342
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,160
- Everything. You can rely on me.
Security, everything.

343
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,520
- That's twenty...
- Even your fare.

344
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
- But I still don't think...

345
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,240
- Listen, don't force yourself.

346
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,880
I've had other offers.

347
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,760
Alois said he'd go to jail for me.
- Alois?

348
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,840
- Yeah, Alois!
He would enjoy to do it for me.

349
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,320
And what did he
promise us in exchange?

350
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,240
- Yes?
- For Christmas.

351
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,800
- What did he promise?
- Just guess. - What?

352
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,000
- A goose! What a nice man!

353
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,600
- But Tony said:
Only my dear Cuckoo...

354
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,800
- Exactly, that's I've said.

355
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,680
- Surely not Alois.

356
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,520
I'd do your time for you much better.
- That's true.

357
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,960
I am sure that if Cuckoo does it,
he'll do it well.

358
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,640
- That I would. - Exactly.
- And twenty golden. - Yeah, yeah.

359
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,520
- And what will you be doing, boss?

360
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,480
- I'll be working at the organ
in the small workshop, understand?

361
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,560
- Yeah.
- But I do have one request, Cuckoo.

362
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,880
This must remain a secret.
- Yeah.

363
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,040
- No one else may know.
It's just between the three of us.

364
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,040
You know about, my wife knows and I do.
- Yeah.

365
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,800
- We must shake on that.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

366
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,800
- Ma'am, is Cuckoo here?
Do I have to work alone?

367
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,600
- He is here.
Imagine, he gave us notice.

368
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,880
- What a character,

369
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,000
now when the boss needs us.

370
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,520
- Right, you're the character.

371
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:14,080
- But you can depend on me, ma'am.
I'll manage everything.

372
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,560
Just as if your husband were here.

373
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:22,640
- Ma'am, what about potato cakes
for lunch tomorrow?

374
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:42,000
- If the boss had such lunch in jug,
wouldn't he smack his lips.

375
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,000
- See to your work,
I'll bring your lunch to the workshop.

376
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,600
- It's not worth going there again.
And it's warmer here.

377
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,840
What about beer, ma'am?

378
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,320
I have to keep up my strength,
now I work for three.

379
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,280
- Hector, here!

380
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,200
- And what about me?

381
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,160
- Quiet, Tony! Quiet, please!

382
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,480
- I'm so hungry,
and you just ignore me!

383
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,400
It's just - Hector, here, Hector, here,
but nothing for me!

384
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,800
At least one potato cake!

385
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,720
- So take one.
- Where?

386
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,040
- Here.
- Ah, thanks.

387
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,640
- Hide, Tony - hide, please!

388
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,840
- Ma'am, what about creamed potatoes
for supper?

389
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,200
The boss likes those too.

390
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,560
But he's on bread and water now.

391
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,640
Jail is jail...

392
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,240
- This prison will kill me.

393
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,000
- Stop moaning, Tony,
you ain't in jail!

394
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,120
- I'm surprised I'm not happier,

395
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,520
considering Cuckoo's there in my place!

396
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,000
Considering Cuckoo's there in my place!

397
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,920
- That's all right, I'll sit here.

398
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,160
Two frankfurters, please.

399
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
PRISON

400
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,240
GET READY FOR WINTER AND BUY
FUR COAT IN TIME!

401
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,480
PRISON

402
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:38,360
- It's so cold...

403
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,320
- Good morning!
- Good morning, auntie.

404
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,960
- I was walking past,

405
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,400
so I thought I'd look on you.

406
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,240
- That's nice of you.

407
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,800
- How do you like to being a grass
widow?

408
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,160
- It's difficult to get used to, auntie.

409
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,840
- With such a husband as yours,

410
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,480
worse things will follow.
I knew this would happen.

411
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,360
He's only in jail now,
but he'll end up on the gallows.

412
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,800
He looks like a murderer!
- I am going to... oops!

413
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,600
- You mark my words.

414
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,040
- But he is innocent, auntie.

415
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,920
- So he got three months
for his goodness of heart, what?

416
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,000
- Wait, who's there?

417
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,040
- That's the dog.
I shut him in there.

418
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:48,520
Down, Hector!
Oh, he's here!

419
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:55,360
Must be the damp trough creaking.

420
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,360
- I am sorry for you,

421
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,080
but your husband
is a disgrace for the whole family.

422
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,840
That's what I came to tell you.

423
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,560
- I've had enough of this.
- Tony, please, don't shout.

424
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,120
- How can I listen
to such things about me?

425
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,680
If that old cow comes here again,

426
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,520
I'll whack her into the floor like a nail.

427
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,840
- Take no notice, get back to your work.

428
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,320
The organ needs finishing

429
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,640
and Alois can't manage alone.

430
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,480
- Such relatives...
The devil take them!

431
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:01,280
I'll see to it
our family dies out!

432
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,000
You'll see, talking back!

433
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,440
- I came...
You see, I thought...

434
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,760
Thought that Tony'll be feeling
lonely in there.

435
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:41,560
And I never said that
about your eating a dog.

436
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,400
Tony's sometimes such a tell-tale.

437
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,440
- Have you come to heap dirt on Tony?

438
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,680
- Me? He's my best friend!

439
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:03,040
No, indeed.
I want to visit him in jail.

440
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:09,880
- Oh no, Mr. Kacaba.
That might disturb him.

441
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,800
- He'd be glad!

442
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,000
- No, I don't want you to visit him.

443
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,680
See where your friendship brought him.

444
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,880
- It wasn't our friendship that did it.

445
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,000
It must be an unhappy home!

446
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,840
- What do you say to that?

447
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,400
- There's something to what he says.

448
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,520
- What is there to eat, ma'am?

449
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,920
- That guy is so greedy!

450
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,080
- That guy is so greedy!

451
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,080
- It's good...

452
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,200
Except for one thing.
- What?

453
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,360
- No one's gonna pay for it.

454
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,400
- Your are broke
and order such a spread?

455
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,560
They'll put you away.

456
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,120
- Just the thing for me.
- You want to go to jail?

457
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:37,960
- Yeah, over the winter.
- So let me tell you something.

458
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,960
- And so will I.
If you hear a bang from that closet,

459
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,400
it's me, exploding.

460
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,520
After three weeks in there

461
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,680
I feel like a walled-in nun.

462
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,440
- And I've had enough, too.
- Enough, too.

463
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,800
- And it's all your fault.
- Me, sure.

464
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,400
- You and your liquor.

465
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,120
- Don't nag!
As if other men didn't drink.

466
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,160
Give me some food and stop preaching.

467
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,760
- Here, eat it in the corner.

468
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,240
- In the corner!
Like Hector.

469
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,720
Throw it in the kennel,
and I can do his barking for him!

470
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,000
I want it on the table!
I'm a decent citizen.

471
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,920
I pay my taxes!

472
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,400
Wait, what's that growling?
- Your stomach rumbling.

473
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,680
- See how starved I am.

474
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,680
Did you shut the door?
- I did.

475
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,080
- One cannot even eat here!

476
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,200
- Ma'am, somebody wants you.

477
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,640
- Have some weird clash
with the cello.

478
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:52,040
- What on earth have you done to it?
- Nothing.

479
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,000
The man was just playing.

480
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,280
Then he put the cello down like this
and said to the bass player:

481
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:07,000
Man, you're wailing today
as if Mr. Hooter was in jail!

482
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,280
I didn't like his talk,
wanted to remind him,

483
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,320
and snatched up the cello.

484
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,960
Whilst teaching him his lesson,
it broke.

485
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,680
- You sure spoil me, ma'am.

486
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,040
- Enough.

487
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,960
- There wasn't too much meat,
but I enjoyed it.

488
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,520
- Go home, Alois.
Get going!

489
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,080
- I've been watching him.

490
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,000
Look, he picked it clean!
The greedy bastard!

491
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:33,520
Why didn't I go to jail?

492
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,840
There I'd have my bread and water.

493
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,800
I'm going to shoot that guy.

494
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,120
- Calm down, down shout.
- But I'm hungry!

495
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,440
- I'll fetch something for you.
I know you're hungry.

496
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,440
You must mend this cello,
and soon.

497
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,200
- I'll do it.
- Must be done tomorrow.

498
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,400
- I'll do everything.

499
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:12,280
I'm so hungry I squint.

500
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:27,800
I'd even eat the wood shavings.

501
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,000
- Here you are.

502
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,240
- Who is it?
- Alois.

503
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,600
Something important.

504
00:54:59,360 --> 00:54:59,600
- Such a terrible thing, terrible thing.
- Yes, terrible thing.

505
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:04,520
- Such a terrible thing, terrible thing.
- Yes, terrible thing.

506
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,040
- Tell her the news
and explain what happened.

507
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,400
- As you say.

508
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,560
- Get out of here!

509
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:54,600
Looks like it'll be the dog kennel
for me soon.

510
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,120
Dog again! Forget it!

511
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,960
- Jesus, hide! Authorities!
- Who?

512
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,440
- Hide, hide!

513
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,160
- Mrs. Hooter, you had a husband.

514
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,240
- I have a husband.
- Your mistake. - What?

515
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,840
- You had a husband, but not any more.

516
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,880
- Excuse me?
- He died in cell 118 yesterday.

517
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,520
I know it's a blow,
but it awaits us all.

518
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,240
- Oh my God.
- But it has its advantages, too.

519
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,560
As he died, he's pardoned
from the rest of his sentence.

520
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:52,680
Here's the death certificate.
That means you're a widow

521
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:57,280
and can remarry. Goodbye.

522
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:07,520
- I could have known!

523
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:15,160
This is the last straw.
Look, I'm getting colder...

524
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:29,400
Look...
I'm turning to a skeleton.

525
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,600
See, this is certified.

526
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,240
- Tony, what will you do?

527
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:44,000
- What can I do?
What a dead man can do?

528
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:50,720
- So poor Cuckoo is dead.

529
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:25,080
- Tony, you can't stay here,
you must get outta house.

530
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,320
- Throw me out, that's the limit.
- You must hide, Tony!

531
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,800
When it's all over,
you can come back.

532
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:42,840
- Back? From the grave?
- Somebody must take you in.

533
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,640
- And who?

534
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,520
- Who?

535
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,640
- Hooter.

536
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,080
- He's dead?
- Quite dead.

537
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,600
- When's the funeral?

538
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,000
- Tomorrow.

539
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,800
- So tomorrow's his funeral.

540
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:28,680
- Poor man, what an odd way to go.
- Who'd ever have thought of it.

541
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,120
- Such a good soul, Tony.

542
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:38,480
My conscience is clear.
Tony won't haunt me.

543
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:43,360
But Commander Ctvrtecka had better
be careful.

544
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,520
It's his fault Tony pegged out.

545
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,200
- Open up, Kacaba.

546
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:46,880
Open up!
I'm half frozen!

547
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:53,880
- Tony's ghost... Lay, ghost!
- Don't lay anyone.

548
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:00,760
You'd better open up or I'll break
your window! Do you hear me?

549
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,280
- Tony, I've never hurt you,

550
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,800
why have you come to haunt me?

551
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,600
Go and haunt Ctvrtecka!

552
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:24,880
- Let me in, man.
I'm like an icicle.

553
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:33,680
High time, too.
Don't touch me, it's me.

554
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,560
Gimme a drop of liquor.

555
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,160
- It really is you.
- I am.

556
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:43,760
- Thank God.
Tony, but what it's all about?

557
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,520
- What...

558
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,200
- What's happening?

559
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,520
- I'll explain when I unfreeze.

560
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,560
- What can you explain,
it's your funeral tomorrow!

561
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:02,120
- Yeah, my funeral tomorrow.

562
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,120
- Thank you.

563
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:41,520
- She's still a good-looker, you know.
And the house is hers now.

564
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:47,560
- I'm a widower, too,
but for me she'd have to be younger.

565
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:54,440
- There must be his clothes.
- Certainly.

566
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,960
- Am I right for the funeral party?

567
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,440
My sympathetique.

568
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:29,080
I am the brother of the deceased.

569
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:36,240
I have lived abroad for 25 years
and you will hardly remember me,

570
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:43,160
dear sis-in-law.
I received telegram and came in once,

571
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:49,600
to see to things myself, sis.

572
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:55,640
It's been a long time.
You don't remember me, sis.

573
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,760
- You here? This is the end.

574
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,680
- That's why I came.

575
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:08,280
I am the dead man's brother now.
- Excuse me, Sir. - Yes.

576
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:13,360
- You're the spitting image of the boss!

577
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:20,000
- That is possible.
With whom do I have the honoree?

578
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,280
- I'm Alois.
- Are you?

579
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:29,360
- We were twins originally.
I mean, I am a twin.

580
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:36,360
So was my brother.
We were brothers to start with.

581
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:41,680
Now you've mixed me up...

582
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,000
What are you doing here, gentlemen?

583
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,480
You put something
into that wardrobe, what?

584
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,280
Playing at moths, are you?

585
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,320
I inherited all this.

586
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,920
Why don't you lock it up,
sister-in-law?

587
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:06,360
Put that back!
Back into the wardrobe!

588
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,320
Withdraw, please!

589
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:26,720
- Tereza! What a tragedy!

590
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:32,280
What could have happened?
Nice wreath, ah?

591
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:42,800
Some people are born unlucky.

592
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:48,680
Alois drinks all day long,
and he's still here.

593
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:56,120
And poor Anton had to die.
Such a pride of the family!

594
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:03,160
He loved me so. He always said:
Aunt Josephine, if I should die,

595
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:10,320
you get the porcelain clock.
With the angel blowing the trumpet.

596
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:17,520
Does it still make good time?
My clock!

597
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:21,320
What if I had this, too?

598
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,760
- I'll show you the clock, hands off!
The clock stays here!

599
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:28,200
- This clock is mine!
- It's ours!

600
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,600
I am Tony's brother
and I won't let people take things!

601
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,520
- What?
- I'm Tony's brother.

602
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:39,760
- Now I recognize you.
You're the globetrotter...

603
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,400
Got into trouble
and had to leave home.

604
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,520
One worse than the other.
Clock is mine and I'm taking it.

605
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,360
- The clock stays here!
- It's mine!

606
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:48,960
- It's ours!
- Mine!

607
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:49,960
- Ours!
- Mine!

608
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:55,480
- Get out!
- You'll never see me here again.

609
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,640
- We'll try and bear up.

610
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,080
- You'd like the wreath, what?
Nothing!

611
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:15,280
- Speak like that of Tony,
such a good man.

612
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:23,160
Good one and so handsome...
Ain't that sad?

613
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,560
- Mrs. Hooter, I know
I am no welcome guest.

614
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:51,280
But fate is fate.

615
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:57,240
Please accept my sympathy.
- Thank you.

616
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,400
- We'll give him a splendid funeral!

617
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:06,040
A great show,
the whole company,

618
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:11,280
a cushion with that medal on it...

619
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,440
Pity he won't be able to hear
the salvo in his honor.

620
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:28,200
- Forward march!

621
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,920
- The last goodbye.

622
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:56,560
Am I, or am I not,
what a fall.

623
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:02,800
They all say I'm not here at all.

624
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:09,120
Mourn do all the neighbors,

625
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:14,680
forcing themselves to grieve.

626
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:20,680
And all this squealing and hooting,

627
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:26,760
had I my rifle, I'd start shooting.

628
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:33,320
The band plays for my last goodbye,

629
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:39,280
but there's poisonous gossip
in every eye.

630
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:45,360
Anton Hooter, Sharpshooter,

631
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:50,000
when he screams for liquor

632
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,240
and the devil gets into him

633
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,680
the results are pretty grim.

634
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:07,760
Now I can but rant and rave -

635
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,560
this funeral will be my grave.

636
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:26,120
Yeah, Kacaba must always has a solo.

637
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:33,720
You call yourself a friend?
Shame on you!

638
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,640
It's last goodbye!
Curse you...

639
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,440
- Why hide,
now I'm somebody else.

640
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:20,640
A ghost! Oh, a ghost!
What... what do you want of me?

641
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,240
- Twenty gold pieces.

642
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:30,560
- Cuckoo, you here?

643
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,920
- I want those twenty
you've owing me,

644
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,280
because I'm getting married.
Where's the boss?

645
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,240
- The boss... come here.
I'm the boss!

646
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:41,840
- Oh, no.

647
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,640
- Hush, come along,
I'll tell you.

648
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,680
Be quiet, sit down.

649
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,560
- I heard, boss.
But it's not my fault.

650
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,080
I didn't know that guy
would die on me in there!

651
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,400
- Who?
- The guy who did my time for me.

652
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:06,560
- So, some stranger dies
and I have to be my own brother.

653
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,520
- Are you his brother?
- I'm my brother.

654
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,080
My brother's away.
I'm not supposed to be here.

655
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:19,440
I'm down there.
My brother is here.

656
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:24,440
Actually, I'm the brother.
There's two of us, brothers.

657
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,720
I'm the brother over there,
and he's the brother over here.

658
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,880
And I'm there.

659
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,600
I don't know where I am,
could be the other way round, too.

660
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:38,320
- Who'll give me my money?
- God knows.

661
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:51,720
Listen, Buckoo... Cuckoo, see me.
What if I went to court...

662
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,000
...confessed it all

663
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,240
and you did my time for me?

664
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,600
- They'd lock us both up.

665
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:04,160
- That's the trouble.
Devil to it, Puckoo!

666
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,400
- Cuckoo...
- Buckoo...

667
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:11,840
What did I get myself into?
But what do I care?

668
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:18,000
I'll marry my wife
and pretend I'm my brother till I die.

669
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,400
- What do you think of me?

670
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,240
- I like you better now
than when you were my husband!

671
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:44,440
- Don't say that,
I could get jealous of myself

672
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,880
and beat myself up one day!

673
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,760
- But you look so handsome, Tony!

674
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,440
- They accepted me right away,
though nobody gets into the company.

675
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:59,200
They needed
such a fine figure of a man.

676
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:04,000
- Mind you, keep away from the pub!

677
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:11,200
- You mean liquor?
No need to remind me.

678
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,000
I'll never taste that stuff again.

679
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:19,120
I'd end up with three months again,

680
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,120
and where would I be?

681
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,960
- And then, I was in Russia.

682
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,640
I was very happy there.

683
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:36,000
The only bad thing was

684
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,400
the awful cold.

685
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:45,280
Such cruel frosts.
Really cruel frosts, just imagine.

686
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:52,880
Once there was a frost-cruel,
such a cruel winter, a frost-cruel,

687
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,520
that's Russian, leave me alone,
they say it in Russia like that.

688
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:04,800
A cruel so cold,
when we went out at night,

689
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:14,200
we froze stiff.

690
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:18,400
They broke us
off the pavement like icicle.

691
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,160
So cold that when you uttered "water,"

692
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:27,520
it froze at your lips!
Terrible.

693
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,600
Then I left for Poland.

694
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,240
There I spent ten years.

695
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:38,880
Ten years in Poland!
A marvelous country..., marvelous!

696
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:44,360
What's that?
A hypnotist or something?

697
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,720
- Are you Rudolf Hooter?
- He is.

698
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,960
- I knew you at once!
May I gentlemen?

699
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:04,720
Do you remember me?
Look at me, man!

700
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,000
Remember when we saw each other last!

701
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,600
In Warsaw, do remember.
- Right.

702
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,440
- Well, it was years ago...
(In Polish) It's already long time we met

703
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:17,000
each other for the last time.
- Oh really...

704
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:20,120
- And how have you been all that long,
long time?

705
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:20,680
- Uhm.

706
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,320
- So, I was fine, my dear.

707
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,800
- And how have you been all the time?
- I've been well, very well.

708
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,480
I can't complain.
- Well...

709
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,480
- I have made such good money
in Warsaw...

710
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,120
- You see!

711
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,840
...that I am not expected to work
anymore... till I die.

712
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,240
- Oh dear.
- Yes, yes, yes.

713
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:36,040
- So you don't do anything?

714
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:39,360
- Exactly, my dear, I do nothing.
I was selling some Christmas goods

715
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,960
there in Warsaw...
- I see.

716
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,000
- And later ice-cream and some chips
as well.

717
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,960
- Oh, in ships he deals.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.

718
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,240
- That's clear.
- Yeah, yeah.

719
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,800
- And what about you, my dear, what did
you do? So, tell me what was your life.

720
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,360
- About our lunch, that's what he asks.

721
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,000
- So, what you say?
- Oh yes, we had already.

722
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,200
- And tell me, why don't you speak
Polish to me?

723
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,880
- How, what do you say?

724
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,200
(Back in Czech)
But why not speak Polish?

725
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,600
- Who?
- You.

726
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:10,120
- I do, I'm just translating as I am.

727
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,400
- Here it's in Polish,
but it comes out in Czech.

728
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,200
- Wow! Let's drink together.

729
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,640
- Yeah.
- At our reunion!

730
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:21,640
- How many's the company?
Liquor!

731
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,040
- Liquor!

732
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,040
- Again.
- Liquor!

733
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,520
- Rudolph, don't!
It'll be your death again!

734
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:47,760
- What's death? Again, death...

735
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,000
- Again.

736
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:57,040
- Now start shooting,
and here we go again!

737
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,800
- A good idea! Pass me a rifle!

738
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,960
- Don't dare, sit down! Dolphi!

739
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:06,120
- Leave me alone, don't push me down,

740
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:13,800
I'll say something... I'll say something.

741
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,760
I feel like saying it...

742
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,320
The Emperor is...

743
01:18:22,305 --> 01:18:28,355
