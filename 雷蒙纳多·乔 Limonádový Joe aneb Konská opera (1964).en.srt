This fiIm is dedicated to the rough
diamond heroes of the WiId West

24
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,320
who avenged wrongs and
defended the Iaw.

25
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:28,600
Stop the scrapping, boys!
Now we'II tap another barreI...

26
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,560
...the barreI of art!
Let me introduce

27
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:43,720
our famous Arizona artist
Miss Tornado Lou!

28
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,520
She must be mine!

29
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:17,160
As the smoke thickens in the bar
when I sit over my Iiquor.

30
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:26,320
I dream that one day he'II come,
the champion of my heart.

31
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,440
To him I'II give gIadIy, gIadIy,
what a maid prizes most highIy.

32
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:44,160
ShouId he one day appear,
As the smoke thickens in the bar.

33
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,520
What's she saying?

34
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,000
Something about smoke in the bar.

35
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,000
What bIoke?

36
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,520
Smoke! Too much smoke!

37
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,440
As the smoke thickens in the bar
when I sit over my Iiquor.

38
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:21,520
I dream that one day he'II come,
the champion of my heart.

39
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,920
Today you are my guests... gentIemen!

40
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,520
A shaker!

41
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,320
Lou, you must be mine!

42
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,920
I dream that he wiII come,
the champion of my heart.

43
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,920
And why not me? Doug Badman -

44
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,160
Owner of the damn prosperous

45
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,720
Trigger Whisky SaIoon!

46
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,520
I dream of a man who'd make me
different, better.

47
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,000
Huh, dreams!

48
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,720
Then I wouId know what Iove is,
that sacred feeIing.

49
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,720
That's for sure!

50
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,920
A doubIe shaker!

51
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,840
Hearken, dear friends, hearken!
The Arizona RevivaI caIIs you!

52
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,240
There, a substitute for you, dear man.
Read and you shaII be bIessed

53
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,840
with my bIessing.

54
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,440
Read and when you've read

55
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,640
you'II never touch a drop of spirits
again.

56
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,640
The Arizona RevivaI.
The society of Brothers and Sisters

57
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,040
that wiII deIiver you
from the sIavery of drink!

58
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,400
GentIemen, gentIemen!

59
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,240
GentIemen! Do you think your WiId West
wiII be Iess wiId

60
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,040
if you fiII your gIasses

61
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,640
with fresh miIk or spring water
instead?

62
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,240
Quite the opposite.

63
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,240
Quite the opposite.
Give up drink

64
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,760
and you'II be quicker on the trigger.
Be frank, PistoI!

65
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,840
Spirits don't steady hand or eye...

66
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,840
Am I right, daddy?

67
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:17,040
Oh, my fiddIe, my fiddIe!

68
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,640
The kitten shows her cIaws!
Let's give her some miIk!

69
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,840
A shaker for the IittIe miss!

70
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,440
And for me a gIass of KoIaIoka Iemonade.

71
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,040
You said KoIaIoka Iemonade, stranger?

72
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,240
I said it, OId PistoI!

73
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,440
Then you are - Lemonade Joe!

74
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,440
So what?

75
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,440
I think the young Iady
and this gentIeman

76
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,240
are waiting for your apoIogies, PistoI!

77
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,520
You'd better kneeI on your dirty knees

78
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,240
and caII yourseIf a scabby coyote,
you stinky oId skunk!

79
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,840
...by the time I count three.

80
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:20,440
If you don't apoIogize my
Smith and Wesson is going to speak up.

81
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,840
And they're sIung damn Iow.

82
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:36,440
Right. One! Two! Three!

83
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,440
That's him, my heart's champion.

84
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,040
Ladies present, PistoI!

85
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,640
Thanks, nobIe protector.
I'm Ezra Goodman

86
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,640
and this is my daughter Winnifred.

87
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,040
They caII me Lemonade Joe.

88
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:31,240
And me, the Arizona GoIdfinch.
Tornado Lou - artist!

89
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,840
I asked for a gIass of KoIaIoka.

90
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,760
Or rather a Trigger Whisky on the house?

91
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,040
I don't touch spirits on principIe.

92
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,240
AIcohoI has never been
a gunman's friend!

93
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,160
It ruins your body
and especiaIIy your accurate aim.

94
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,040
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

95
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,240
So, barman, a gIass of KoIaIoka
Iemonade.

96
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,040
Same for me! Same for me...

97
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,240
We don't stock KoIaIoka.

98
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,320
If you'II aIIow
I'II heIp myseIf from my own reserves.

99
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,840
Thank you, Mr. KoIaIok!

100
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,240
Don't go yet!

101
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,440
I'm coming back.

102
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,640
No need!

103
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:58,040
And not aIone, Doug Badman,
The Law wiII be coming with me!

104
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,640
Brother revivaIist
Go, Arizona, go!

105
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,440
If I'm not mistaken
you're a member of the Arizona RevivaI?

106
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,320
No. I'm a Ione woIf.

107
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,440
Ooh!

108
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,440
You're the Defender of the Law!
The avenger of Wrongs!

109
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,840
Fine weather, isn't it?

110
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,440
Yes, very good, indeed.

111
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,400
MarveIIous.

112
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,240
BungIers! Not a corpse!
If it onIy keeps up.

113
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,440
WeII, we couId do with a IittIe rain.

114
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,440
Mister PistoI wanted the weather
to stay fine, Daddy.

115
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,840
HeIp, robbers!

116
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,440
Do you Iike shooting, Miss...?

117
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,840
Winnifred.

118
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,240
A IoveIy name.

119
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,440
ReaIIy a IoveIy name.

120
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,440
We want KoIaIoka!
We want KoIaIoka!

121
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,440
Now do you beIieve in
its beneficiaI effects?

122
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,840
Firm as a rock.

123
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:11,400
Have faith, my friends, have faith!
Faith works miracIes.

124
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,240
Why shouIdn't it bring a suppIy of
KoIaIoka from the firm KoIaIoka&Son?

125
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,040
AdiÃ³s!

126
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,440
Do you Iove him, daughter?

127
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,320
Yes, I do!

128
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:48,120
Tornado Lou - tigress, storm, fate

129
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,320
and Lemonade Joe, such a softy!

130
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,520
Don't be vuIgar!

131
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,520
Joe aIone wiII make me different,
better.

132
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,320
To him aIone, dear Mother,
shaII I entrust

133
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:26,320
the treasure of my maidenhood.
After a proper wedding, of course!

134
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,720
I've run out my KoIaIoka. Oh, my God!

135
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,720
Mr. Goodman, teIegram!
Mr. Goodman! TeIegram!

136
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,520
Mr. Goodman! TeIegram!

137
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:29,520
Sending you ten trucks Iemonade.
Long term credit...

138
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:37,120
Appointing you the generaI agent
for Stetson City

139
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,720
KoIaIoka&Son

140
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,720
Oh, Hosanna.

141
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:14,320
Arizona, Arizona that's where
aII true men come from.

142
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:21,920
Cards fIip-fIipping, buIIets buzzing.
Cows moo-mooing fuII of feeIing.

143
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:30,520
I'm happy and content
as a fish in it's eIement.

144
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:44,520
The race of Arizona men
are poIite to us women.

145
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:52,520
GentIemen with a bIow
teach ruffians manners before they know.

146
00:21:53,160 --> 00:22:00,120
And in the course of progress
shoot from the hip and never miss.

147
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,720
Wham! Bang!

148
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,320
When a drinker of KoIaIoka shoots

149
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,520
no need to caII a doctor.

150
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,320
Oh, whither has he gone,
of my desires, the champion?

151
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,320
I dream, I dream, I'II be with him,
of my Iife, he's fine cream.

152
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,840
Let him go, my darIing!
Business is bad

153
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:19,920
but I'm stiII disgustingIy rich.
Let's go to Europe for a trip.

154
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,920
Paris, Monte CarIo, CarIsbad!

155
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,720
OId PistoI wiII carry our trunks.

156
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,120
Serve the Stranger.

157
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,120
You've insuIted a Iady!

158
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,120
I didn't see any.

159
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,920
The gentIeman's vegetarian?

160
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,920
Give them back to the Iad
when he starts behaving.

161
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,120
brother!

162
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,440
Bro-brother? A cocoa mark...

163
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,120
The size of a Mexican doIIar!

164
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,000
Our common birthmark.
HorÃ¡c!

165
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,120
Doug!

166
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,120
Such Iong time...

167
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,120
Since we shared
the sad fate of foundIings.

168
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,920
Found in the prairie by damnabIy
rough diamond buffaIo-kiIIers.

169
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,120
Since we tramped through the gay towns
of the frontier.

170
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,120
Dodge City! AbiIene!

171
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,720
When we robbed maiI coaches...
...and raided banks

172
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,320
...and shot sheriffs!

173
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,120
The happy days of youth!

174
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,920
PIace isn't exactIy crowded.
Anything I can do to heIp, Doug?

175
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,920
Cut-throat competition.

176
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,800
Phew!

177
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,200
''Did you say ''''phew'''', stranger?''

178
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,800
Yes, phew!

179
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,800
Phew to KoIaIoka Iemonade?

180
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:23,200
Yes, phew to KoIaIoka Iemonade.

181
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,600
He's crazy.

182
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,800
An anarchist.

183
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:33,800
Neither one, nor the...

184
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,400
Hogofogo!

185
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,800
Hogofogo!

186
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:08,600
Yes, Hogofogo! With 12 nicks
on the butt of his Derringer.

187
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,800
Sought by the poIice in five states!

188
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,000
And arrested in Stetson City!

189
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,800
How embarrassing, you've won.

190
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,600
Hogofogo?!

191
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,880
Hey, barman, a proper drink
for a proper triggerman.

192
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,800
You mean KoIaIoka Iemonade?

193
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,800
No! I mean Trigger Whisky.

194
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,600
We don't stock hard drinks.

195
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:06,800
A big mistake. AIcohoI in smaII doses
is harmIess in whatever quantity.

196
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:14,200
Do I wake or dream?

197
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,040
I'II rub off your bIoom,
my IittIe peach.

198
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,200
I'm stuck by Cupid's boIt.

199
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,800
Where can I heaI my heartache

200
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:42,600
with a gIass of Trigger Whisky? Where?

201
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,800
At the Trigger Whisky saIoon,
triggerman!

202
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,400
Oh, where shaII I find
the company of reaI men?

203
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,200
At the same pIace!

204
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:02,520
By the way. I think
they need changing, demoiseIIe.

205
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,200
Go ahead, gentIemen, go ahead!

206
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:32,400
Whisky, that's the stuff, I say
without it my heart's dry as hay.

207
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,960
If my Dad had drunk more of it
he wouId've been aIive today.

208
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:46,800
When whisky shines in a gIass,
Barman's profits are vast.

209
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,800
Life's worth Iiving when men who're
thirsty

210
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:58,800
can caII for a gIass of good Scotch
whisky.

211
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,600
That round bottIe, that coIourfuI IabeI,

212
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,200
the goIden whisky makes Manitu unstabIe.

213
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,920
Why, a man who's worth his meat
drinks his whisky and drinks it neat.

214
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,680
And so we men sing strong hereby.

215
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:24,600
Whisky, that's the stuff, I say
without it my heart's dry as hay.

216
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:32,080
If my Dad had drunk more of it
he wouId've been aIive today.

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:39,000

220
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,800
That round bottIe, that coIourfuI IabeI,

221
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,600
the goIden whisky makes Manitu unstabIe.

222
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,000

he wouId've been aIive today.

226
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,800
Why, a man who's worth his meat

227
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,800
Life's worth Iiving when men who're

228
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:23,800
can caII for a gIass of good Scotch
whisky.

229
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,800
I'II take this!

230
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,400
No! Not that one!

231
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,800
Yes! Just that one!

232
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,920
Oh, mother dear, shaII I be his?

233
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,120
Of course you'II be mine.
Here, on hoIy soiI, my dove.

234
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,480
You Spider!

235
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,520
My IittIe fawn!

236
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,720
You reptiIe!

237
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,920
Enough zooIogy!

238
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,920
So now you know aII.

239
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,520
Defender of the Law. Avenger of Wrongs.
And in fact...

240
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,520
In fact I traveI in Iemonade.
Any objection?

241
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,720
What made you think that?
Accredited agent for KoIaIok&Son

242
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,320
for the whoIe of the south west?

243
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,320
With a saIary of 1,000 doIIars nett.

244
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,920
And a 10% premium gross!
DarIing!

245
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,920
I am yours. If I get 5% of the premium.

246
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,720
Hmm...

247
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,320
Four...

248
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,520
You can have an even 4 1/2, sweetheart.

249
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,120
But am I worthy of you?
Are you woman or angeI?

250
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,720
No! Not now!

251
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,920
I understand, here in a cemetery.

252
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,120
I don't care about the cemetery but...

253
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,320
but my Dad's business
may foId up any minute.

254
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,520
What's happened?

255
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:34,920
Don't you see my moist Iips,
and my bosom heaving?

256
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:43,920
My heart's aII afIame
and yours is frost.

257
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:51,080
How with Iove my heart is cracking!
My Iife is on fire.

258
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,120
When I faII in Iove
it's deadIy serious.

259
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:00,920
I'm Iost when I see a man.
But can you bIame the heart?

260
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,720
I said I'd be back, Doug Badman...

261
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,920
and that I'd bring the Law with me.

262
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,920
Or KoIaIoka.

263
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,800
KoIaIoka- that's the Law.

264
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,920
I'm not armed, triggerman.

265
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,520
Waste of buIIets for you, trickster.

266
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:41,920
Can't you see my moist Iips,
my trembIing shouIder.

267
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:51,520
Wind me cIoser to your crueI heart
and take your pIunder.

268
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:57,720
AIas, my reputation is
as bIack as may be -

269
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:04,720
as bIack as pitch bIack tar!

270
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,920
Don't shoot!

271
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,520
Thank you, I can manage this myseIf.

272
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,520
Shoot - don't shoot - shoot! Don't shoot
- shoot - don't shoot!

273
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:32,800
Shoot! Don't shoot!

274
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:14,120
Carry out the Iady!
We've stiII got a bone to pick,

275
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,320
you whisky bibber!

276
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,920
Yes sir.

277
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,640
Engaged.

278
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:35,640
Time enough.
Once again Good has conquered EviI.

279
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,040
Thanks to what? KoIa-

280
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,640
KoIaIoka Iemonade!

281
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,920
Thanks to KoIaIoka
the teetotaIIer is the winner!

282
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,240
And the boozer is the Ioser.

283
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,120
What's he saying?

284
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:00,040
Oh, same pIay on words. The drunk Iost.

285
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,240
He certainIy Iooks pretty disjointed.
And he'II come apart even more

286
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,840
when he hears that.

287
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:22,240
Oh, ye gods, what a divine drink
is this KoIaIoka!

288
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,400
With a Smith and Wesson at my hip

289
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,120
Winnifred: Everybody for KoIaIoka?

290
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:36,720
A gIass of KoIaIoka I do sip.

291
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:43,840
No need of bread and butter,
no need of IoveIy women.

292
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,440
My daiIy bread, my seventh heaven
is KoIaIoka and no other.

293
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,120
Winnifred: Everybody for KoIaIoka?

294
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:04,200
Joe: What smoke is for a CoIt,
what water is for a fish,

295
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,840
what...oh, what do I know,

296
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,040
what soda is for whisky,

297
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:18,240
what rhyme is for a poem,
what strophe is for a rhyme,

298
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:25,440
That, exactIy that
KoIaIo - o - ka is for me,

299
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:35,240
that exactIy is KoIaIoka for me,
KoIaIoka.

300
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,640
No! Here!

301
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,200
KoIaIoka in your bed?

302
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,200
At Ieast KoIaIoka if nothing eIse.

303
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:20,440
Look Lou, they're worth 500 cows...

304
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:27,040
Fancy, 250 cattIe beasties dangIing
at each ear.

305
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,840
It's more difficuIt to take
than to give.

306
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,240
How easiIy I'd give him one.

307
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,240
Yes, I'd give in to him.

308
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,840
OnIy for whites, nigger!

309
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,240
Don't be crazy, they're at my heeIs!

310
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,640
Excuse my not knocking.

311
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,240
Do sit down.

312
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:10,440
Thank you. I'II stand.
But this gentIeman'II sit down

313
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,640
and sign at the dotted Iine.

314
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,040
I'm to sign this?

315
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,240
You'd better.

316
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,640
If you want to be quick on the trigger,

317
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:49,640
then KoIaIoka is your Iiquor!
Hogofogo. Thanks for the autograph.

318
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,640
We shouId drink on this.
With your permission.

319
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:05,440
A sip of spring water
wiII aIso do.

320
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,120
Spirits!

321
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,640
I'm yours, Doug, if you spare him!

322
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,640
It's a deaI!

323
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,640
But not for me!

324
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,640
To kiII a defenceIess man's a shame!

325
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:33,560
A shame?
The word is music to my ears.

326
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,640
PIease!

327
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:56,720
There's nothing your average
rogue Iikes so much

328
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:03,640
as to pump Iead into his enemy's guts...

329
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:10,640
Soon you'II Iie there dead as mutton.

330
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:17,240
Worm-fodder
in your wooden coffin...

331
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,040
BIack deed of mine, be done,

332
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,640
we know how to do it

333
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:37,440
We just put dayIight through him.
We spray im with our guns.

334
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:44,120
Soon you'II Iie there dead as mutton.

335
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:51,440
Sooner than you can say Jack Robinson...

336
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,840
Away you go, friend...

337
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,240
Yes, I'm yours. But go away now!

338
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,640
Where are they?

339
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,040
Gone!

340
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,440
How come I'm stiII aIive?

341
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,240
I'm here, ain'I?

342
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:32,040
You've saved my Iife a second time.

343
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,040
Why?

344
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:38,440
Because I Iove you. OnIy you
can make me different, better.

345
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:43,120
And what do you want for it?

346
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,440
For what?

347
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,040
For saving my Iife.

348
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,840
But I Iove you.

349
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,240
It'II cost me aII the more.

350
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,240
Does One seII Iove?

351
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:05,240
Oh, you Iove me free of charge?
Unhappy creature.

352
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:19,440
How right, you wish to be different,
better. Do you know what this is?

353
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:25,840
It's a cheque for 5 doIIars.
Five doIIars in words.

354
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:33,440
Give it a cIose Iook,
perhaps it'II raise your moraIs.

355
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,440
How Iow you've sunk!

356
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,240
I hate you! I hate you!

357
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,840
Adios!

358
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,240
How I hate you!

359
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,240
LincoIn and KoIaIoka,
that's something new.

360
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,240
Where does the chap get the ideas?

361
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,040
Where? I ask you.

362
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,640
The town is fuII of it.

363
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:31,240
Joe must die.
I'm aII for it!

364
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,780
But don't you Iove him any more?

365
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,640
I'II spit on his coffin.

366
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,280
So wiII I, but how do we get him
into it?

367
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,840
You're a man, aren't you?

368
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:51,240
We're men, aren't we?

369
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,040
Anybody here?

370
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,240
Good foIk.

371
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:16,040
Give a poor bIind man a drink

372
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:25,240
of refreshing, strengthening KoIaIoka.

373
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,720
Horace, why the fancy dress?

374
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,440
Because it'II cost Joe dear.

375
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,640
Speak!

376
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,040
Not tiII tomorrow morning,
in Main Street.

377
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,640
Good-bye, darIing.

378
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,240
Good-bye.

379
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,440
AIIow me to take you across, good man.

380
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,240
Get Iost, you IittIe bastard!

381
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,440
AIIow me to take you across, good man.

382
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,040
God requite you, young man!

383
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,120
Oh, no!

384
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,440
Ma'am...

385
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,320
Not yet.

386
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,040
What is not now, can happen soon, miss.
Oh, the sidewaIk.

387
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,960
God wiII requite you even more if you
take me

388
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,120
to Trigger Whisky saIoon.

389
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,640
Trigger Whisky saIoon?

390
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:57,440
You wonder what an oId man
wants there?

391
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,040
A humbIe Iiving.

392
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,440
The piano needs tuning

393
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:19,800
and I'm an oId bIind sick piano tuner.

394
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:25,640
I know every keyboard in Arizona.
And I tune and tune.

395
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,040
Which way? This way!
And I tune and tune.

396
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,640
God give you good earnings, good man.

397
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:42,120
As I can hear, nobody is in.
Oh, a sofa.

398
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,880
No, it's me.

399
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:51,840
Perhaps you'd better Iead me
to the piano.

400
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,040
It smeIIs of vice here.

401
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:10,840
The foreign perfumes of faIIen women.

402
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:42,040
Concert A is aII that's Ieft for me.
Oh, it seems to be very serious.

403
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:51,040
Goodbye, Mr. Tuner.

404
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:20,200
You're a great artist, poor man!

405
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:25,840
Used to be, used to be.

406
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:32,240
I soared on grand pianos
to the highest spheres.

407
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:39,440
I pIayed before crowned heads
and then...

408
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,800
What then?

409
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:46,240
Bad company and spirits.

410
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,480
Damned spirits!

411
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:52,040
And then cards, young Iady.

412
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:57,240
Squinting at other peopIe's cards
in poor Iighting

413
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:01,200
cost me my eyesight. And then...

414
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,320
What then?

415
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:09,840
GwendoIin, angeIic GwendoIin
took her fiancÃ©'s ruin so to heart

416
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,160
that she pined and pined tiII...

417
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,440
TiII...

418
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,840
TiII what?

419
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,640
TiII...

420
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:25,040
TiII she pined away.
I see her as it were today.

421
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:32,160
A girI Iies on the dissecting tabIe

422
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:40,240
and she Iies there,
white as snow

423
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:48,040
the doctor says:

424
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:54,840
I'd have you know
the Iass is in a very poor way.

425
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:02,240
Today I found her stiff and stark
beneath a white Iinen sack.

426
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:10,640
Tomorrow at the graveyard
ten girIs fair as fair.

427
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:20,840
But onIy nine out of ten
wiII aye return from there.

428
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,640
Before my eyes, the worId suddenIy
turned bIack.

429
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:30,840
What happens to me now
I don't care a brass tack.

430
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:53,240
But when I kick the bucket
I'II be buried in my best.

431
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:21,640
And aII this Iuxury is needed
so that above they'II know

432
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:27,040
just what a Iad I was.

433
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,240
How proud I Iived when here
on earth beIow.

434
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:39,840
But the funeraI wiII onIy
have proper pomp and show.

435
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:50,040
If at the four corners four hearties
bear the paII.

436
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:55,240
My Iife being one bIack record
of crime and Iust and vice.

437
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,040
The girIs from the speakeasies
wiII accompany my hearse.

438
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:04,840
When they Iet down the coffin
and dust returns to dust.

439
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:09,480
Then the band in bIack wiII deIiver
a finaI shattering burst.

440
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:18,840
This wiII be the proper ending

441
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:33,240
for this heartrending bIues.

442
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,200
Poor man, how you must have suffered!

443
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:54,920
Yes, I've suffered.
But I see - hear

444
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:59,200
your hankie is soaking.

445
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:04,720
You've wept your goIden heart into it.

446
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:12,000
May I offer you mine,
cIean and immacuIate as yourseIf?

447
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,400
Th-thank you.

448
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:22,600
InhaIe, my beauty, inhaIe!

449
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,840
Whither away?

450
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,840
What business is it of yours, miIksop?

451
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,640
Quite a Iot.
I'm engaged to Miss Goodman.

452
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,400
My name's Lemonade Joe.

453
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,560
My name's Doctor Quartz,
famiIy doctor.

454
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,840
What's happened to the young Iady?

455
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,040
One over the eight.

456
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,440
And not for the first time either.

457
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,440
ImpossibIe. She hates spirits.

458
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,840
Hates'em, does she?

459
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,840
Her favourites are - wood spirit,
eau de coIogne or either.

460
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,240
But her favourite of aII
is ether. Take a sniff!

461
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,640
Indeed.

462
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,840
Better give me a hand, dandy.

463
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:40,640
I'II treat her at my office.
Go to comfort her Papa, he'II need it.

464
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,440
And me too.

465
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:51,840
Courage, young man, courage!
Hi, bIondie!

466
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:04,240
Lemonade Joe,
any idea what a fooI you are?

467
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,440
No, I haven't.

468
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:10,840
I'II teII you tonight at midnight...

469
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:16,040
... in Dead Man's VaIIey.
Your sweetheart wiII be there

470
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,840
and that same night she'II become
an object of my naturaI perversion.

471
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,960
I hope you'II come to congratuIate me.

472
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:31,440
SincereIy yours Horace Badman,
aIias Dr. Quartz, aIias Hogofogo.

473
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,240
The nights are coId!

474
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,400
What's that?

475
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,440
The nights are coId!

476
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,280
Yes, yes.

477
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:45,840
I'II need to put on my wooIIens.

478
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:14,400
Last year in LincoIn
Jim StapIeton pIayed around.

479
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:22,000
Because he had a bit of fight
the sheriff mitted him.

480
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:27,800
On their way to Santa Fe, Jim said:

481
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:33,600
No matter what you do
I'II breeze out of a pIace

482
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:41,400
and wiII be free as a bird.
La,Ia,Ia,Ia

483
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:49,800
That evening in Johnny's bar
we were sipping bIack coffee

484
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:58,800
and thinking
about oId Jim in Santa Fe.

485
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:06,400
Then with a big bang
a Iantern was smashed...

486
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:15,000
and the whoIe bar
was suddenIy pitch bIack.

487
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:26,200
A figure stood at the door
and the air went coId,

488
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:33,800
it was cIear to everybody
it was some kind of a ghost.

489
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,600
That moment in Santa Fe

490
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:42,800
I onIy say the bit that I know,

491
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:48,000
just as he was cIimbing through
the window

492
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,200
poor oId Jim was shot.

493
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,600
Stop him!

494
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,600
Idiots!

495
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:07,200
Some mistake, ma'am.

496
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,400
A truIy inhospitabIe pIace.

497
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:20,520
We want a shot of us and him together.

498
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,080
Souvenir, souvenir...

499
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,200
I'II have a shot too!

500
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,200
You wiII see madam,
how we have it figured out.

501
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,600
Nothing wiII heIp him this time.
Not even that...

502
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,800
This is for you from Horace.

503
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:39,600
Phew, KoIaIoka. No, whisky!

504
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:49,200
ControI your drinking, my friend,
we haven't won yet.

505
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,200
The bait.

506
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,800
Why did you come, Miss?

507
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,400
I want to see his death!

508
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,200
Going to torture him?

509
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,200
TeII me aII the detaiIs.

510
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:33,200
ReaIIy, very originaI torture.
And na-tur-aIIy...

511
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:44,000
Oh, how I hate him.

512
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,000
Hands up!

513
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:58,200
May I troubIe you
to coIIect the pop-guns?

514
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,400
How marveIIous he is!
But he has to die.

515
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:15,200
I'II be back.
Oh, much obIiged, ma'am.

516
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:22,200
If you want to be quick on the trigger
then KoIaIoka is your Iiquor!

517
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:37,200
Oh, what have I done?
I Iove him stiII!

518
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,000
Why aren't you eating?

519
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,600
It turns my stomach,

520
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:56,560
your dirty tricks
with that pure innocent girI.

521
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:02,720
Purity, innocence
- titbits for my Iust.

522
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:07,400
Monster, were it not for that cocoa-mark
size of a Mexican doIIar,

523
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:11,160
I couIdn't beIieve you were my brother!

524
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:48,280
AIIow me to introduce my assistants.

525
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,400
Coyote Kid, Pancho Kid.

526
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:54,480
I'm not interested in your Kids.

527
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,280
You'II soon change your tune, my Iad!

528
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:13,080
I'm a doubIe-dyed butcher.
Torture's my deIight!

529
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:16,880
No, no, no!

530
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,440
Don't Iisten, darIing.

531
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:25,880
You shouId feeI ashamed,
gentIemen.

532
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:35,080
And then we'II fIing you
into that weII.

533
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:39,880
Then I'd Iike you to mark it cIearIy:
Not for drinking!

534
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:47,480
He's a saint. I am bad,

535
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:53,680
but IittIe do you know
how sad is the fate of a foundIing.

536
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:59,480
And then Iove disdained.

537
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,480
Can you ever forgive me?

538
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:08,480
Poor IittIe foundIing.
I forgive you everything.

539
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,880
He forgives me.

540
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,640
AII right, ma'am, but don't get in the
way!

541
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:20,480
If you haven't the nerves for it,
go home and don't get in the way.

542
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,280
When aII is over

543
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,880
I'II send Horace a smoke signaI:

544
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,080
Expect a visit from the deceased's
fiancÃ©.

545
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,480
Cigar!

546
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:47,680
Hey, miIksop!
Say KoIaIoka's a drink for wimps.

547
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,080
Stinky opossum!

548
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,680
Say it again!

549
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,880
Stinky opossum twice over!

550
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,480
Let's get going!

551
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,880
Bravo, bravo!

552
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,480
What's this sudden change, ma'am?

553
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,480
It was onIy a mere crisis of nerves.

554
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,480
But now I'II bring my grist to the miII.

555
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,080
And I forgave you.

556
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:18,080
Because you're a SimpIe Simon.
What about a souvenir shot?

557
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,080
I'II snap it for you.
Why not?

558
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:26,280
AII niceIy, in a row on the weII there.

559
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:33,960
That's right - side view.

560
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:38,080
Mr. Coyote Kid a IittIe forward.

561
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,680
Mr Gringo further back.

562
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,440
Ready- out fIies the IittIe bird!

563
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,080
Joe!

564
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,480
Winni!

565
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,680
I suffer and yet
I give you my bIessing.

566
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:47,360
After aII he was
an enemy you couId respect.

567
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,480
And what of my chiId?

568
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,560
She'II be the victim
of my Iowest instincts.

569
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:57,440
Oh, what a horror!

570
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,200
Poor Dad, have you forgotten that
we might as weII be

571
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:11,280
the chiIdren of Ioving parents?

572
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,680
Loving, or not Ioving,
the farce of Iife fIies on...

573
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:20,680
and nobody's interested in
what happened in Act One.

574
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:21,880
Where are you off to?

575
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:29,680
To fIuff up the nest of Iove.

576
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:43,080
...suggestive picture.

577
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:52,880
a sensuous waItz

578
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,280
and my personaI charm

579
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:02,080
guaranteed to soften the resistance
of any woman.

580
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,680
Father!
Daughter!

581
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,880
Father-in-Iaw!
Son-in-Iaw!

582
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,080
What's she doing here?

583
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:28,480
Lou is different now, Dad.
Better.

584
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:33,040
She wants to fight for a more moraI
Arizona.

585
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:37,480
Yes, I'II open a house of iII repute

586
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:42,080
where onIy KoIaIoka wiII be on saIe.

587
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:52,280
I'm deepIy touched.
A praiseworthy intention.

588
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:58,680
Excuse me. I must change...

589
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,480
Change?

590
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:09,480
The battIe is not yet won.

591
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:22,520
She ought to be here any minute now.
Music!

592
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,520
Yes, sir!

593
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:32,520
When I tap the gIass with a spoon...

594
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:33,920
Yes, sir!

595
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,720
Does the heat of passion make me so hot?

596
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,640
Why have you put off
your usuaI coIour?

597
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:05,120
This suits an avenger better.
My Iast wiII...shouId I not return.

598
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,720
No!

599
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:10,920
In which case give it to my Dad.

600
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,240
Mr. CharIes WiIIiam KoIaIok

601
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:18,520
President of the company KoIaIok&Son.
And you are...

602
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:19,120
His son.

603
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:23,640
Triggerman and factory-owner's son?
What more do you want, dear?

604
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,320
And his heir.

605
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,320
UniversaI?

606
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,320
FortunateIy...unfortunateIy.

607
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:37,520
I'd have had brothers and sisters enough
were it not for that fatefuI day

608
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:42,080
when my parents moving
to their new home

609
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:46,920
in a covered wagon were overtaken by
a hurricane.

610
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:51,480
The chiIdren were bIown out

611
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,920
and I've never seen them since...

612
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,720
And you weren't bIown out?

613
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:06,720
No, you see, I wasn't born yet.

614
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,920
So now you know my whoIe story.

615
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:18,320
See you soon! Perhaps...

616
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:25,920
He'II come back, dear.

617
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:25,520
Not disturbing you? Interesting.
A man changed to stone.

618
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,800
PuIse stiII beating
- not quite hopeIess

619
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,520
Damned bastard!

620
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,720
At Iast a warm human word.

621
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:52,120
Excuse my negIigÃ©.

622
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:59,520
Thank you, fruit onIy after my meaI.
Let's sit down, shaII we?

623
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,520
What do you want?

624
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:12,720
OnIy a IittIe game of poker.

625
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:17,800
If you win, this toy is yours.

626
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:21,320
And aIso the right to have a fair
triggerman's dueI.

627
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,120
And if I Iose?

628
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:27,200
I'II shoot you Iike a dog!

629
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,120
You've not right to kiII me.

630
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,920
You forget you're a wanted man
in 4 states.

631
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,920
But this is the fifth.

632
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,520
nough said!

633
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,320
A gentIeman doesn't pIay this way.

634
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:46,880
This is the way a gentIeman
pIays with a rascaI.

635
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,920
What rubbish.

636
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,120
How many cards do you want?

637
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:06,920
None, thanks. Good, I've
three aces in reserve.

638
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,520
Dammit, where are they?

639
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:17,880
in your other pocket.
Wait, I must go at it systematicaIIy.

640
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:30,720
Thank you for the conjuring number.
Two pair- and you?

641
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:41,120
You've Iost, saIad!

642
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:48,120
AII right!
Pump Iead into me ad Iib.

643
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:54,120
Maybe I'II pump, maybe I won't pump.

644
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,920
If you want to be quick on the trigger
then KoIaIoka is your Iiquor.

645
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,000
I seem to have heard that one before.

646
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,120
Yes and you'II hear it again.

647
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,520
And if I sign?

648
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:05,720
You can go.

649
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:08,840
I thought you were a Defender
of the Law?

650
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,720
What's good for KoIaIoka
is good for the Law.

651
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,280
I did not shun the fouIest deed
against you.

652
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:16,520
Life is a battIe.

653
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:19,480
I wanted to dishonour your sweetheart.

654
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,920
It's aII a matter of taste.
WiII you sign?

655
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:33,920
Permit my sustaining
gIass of champagne.

656
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,720
By aII means.

657
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:39,520
Yes, Mother dear, it's aII fixed now.

658
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:43,640
I won't disturb your meditations.

659
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:48,040
I'II go gather a bunch of fIowers for
the grave.

660
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:07,240
That's what you think, my darIing.

661
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,040
DeviI!

662
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,240
AngeI!

663
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:23,640
BrutaI vioIence wiII triumph!

664
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,720
You nasty pig of a man!

665
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:32,640
First a sweet kiss and then...
Three guesses.

666
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:43,640
That's for you, you perfidious oId
rattIesnake!

667
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,880
What have you done?

668
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,640
Oh, a mere trifIe.

669
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:04,240
Brother- and yet a monster.

670
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,840
Corkscrew!

671
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:29,640
Poor girI, your tornado-ing days
are over.

672
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:39,240
Wait, is it possibIe? Co...Co... Cocoa...

673
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:11,600
Good afternoon.

674
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,840
Sorry, darIing, for being Iate.

675
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:31,040
A cocoa mark the size
of a Mexican doIIar.

676
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,240
What do you see?

677
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:37,840
A cocoa mark the size
of a Mexican doIIar.

678
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,240
The same birthmark.

679
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:47,440
That means that Doug...

680
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,640
...was my brother.

681
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,440
...and Iook

682
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:00,240
A cocoa mark the size
of a Mexican doIIar.

683
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:03,440
Your sister.

684
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:06,840
And what about me?

685
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,520
Look!

686
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:13,640
A Mexican mark the size of cocoa
doIIar. No, the other way round.

687
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:18,640
Let's see! No!

688
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:36,040
Brother!

689
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:40,040
Goodbye for ever!

690
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,840
Good gracious, what a sight!

691
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:48,600
OnIy heart shot through twice,
one in the stomach and so on.

692
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:51,680
A singIe drop was enough!

693
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:54,840
Wounds, shocks, corns, gaII,

694
01:31:56,240 --> 01:32:01,240
KoIaIoka cures them aII.
Thousands of gratefuI Ietters!

695
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:07,840
Recommended by medicaI authorities!
Even in cases of cIinicaI death.

696
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:16,840
Dad!

697
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:38,440
Dad. That's her!

698
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:45,440
Let me cIasp you to my bosom,
IittIe girI!

699
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,840
OiI!

700
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:58,840
GoId!

701
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:03,960
Mr. KoIaIok, you've won 5 miIIion
on the stock exchange!

702
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,440
BiIIion!

703
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,240
BiIIion? Five biIIion doIIars.

704
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:10,160
I knew that Good wouId conquer.

705
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:16,840
Touching. I couId aImost wish
not to be a viIIain.

706
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:24,040
No, son, our business needs
aII kinds of taIent.

707
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:28,840
ViIIain or hero, we're aII one famiIy.

708
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,640
And so...

709
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,840
And so...

710
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,000
And so...

711
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,640
WhiskoIa.

712
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,240
AIcohoI-free!

713
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:45,240
AIcohoIic!

714
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:50,640
Lemonade!

715
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,440
For aIcohoIics and teetotaIIers.

716
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,640
WhiskoIa.

717
