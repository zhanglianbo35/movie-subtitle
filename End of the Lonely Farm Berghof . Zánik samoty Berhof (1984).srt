1
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:26,327
The boys caught her by the town
border, commander.

2
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:28,527
She has no permit and won't speak.

3
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:30,404
-German?
-What else.

4
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:39,364
Leave us alone.

5
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:46,325
<i>Bitte, Schwester.</i>

6
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:49,484
I can speak Czech.

7
00:00:55,767 --> 00:01:00,602
-Where are you going, sister?
-I help people in need.

8
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,364
Do you believe that?

9
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:10,358
Why, what do you believe in?

10
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:13,519
Not in this.

11
00:01:15,607 --> 00:01:17,040
Then I feel sorry for you.

12
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:29,447
Here, this is your permit
valid for two months.

13
00:01:29,447 --> 00:01:31,597
Fill in your details yourself.

14
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:36,200
I would prefer not to see you
around here again.

15
00:01:37,887 --> 00:01:39,684
So would I.

16
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:21,527
God bless you, sister.

17
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:24,644
Jump on, I'll give you a lift.

18
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:28,558
Where are you running?

19
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:31,046
What a silly moth.

20
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:34,045
Go!

21
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:37,358
Go!

22
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:23,845
<i>-Whoa!
-(in Polish) Hello, Gusta</i>

23
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:26,720
<i>How are you?</i>

24
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:30,959
<i>What are you carrying, tobacco?</i>

25
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:35,076
No tobacco, Florian.
Not even saccharin.

26
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:38,080
Just some oil and nails.

27
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,246
I myself am dying for a smoke.

28
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:44,365
<i>Come down then, let's
have a drink</i>

29
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:50,726
I want to be at Berhof
before the night falls.

30
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:57,078
<i>Why are you shaking?</i>

31
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:02,118
Weird things are going on
around here, Florian.

32
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:07,159
<i>-You know what I met at Hartl's
oak? -No.</i>

33
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:09,479
A nun.

34
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:13,159
<i>So it goes.</i>

35
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:16,637
<i>Some see bats, you see a nun.</i>

36
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:20,039
Go, Bob, go!

37
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:26,644
Close the windows for the
night, Florian.

38
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:29,915
<i>How did a nun get here?</i>

39
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:34,560
<i>There is hardly any work left
here for Jesus's servants.</i>

40
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:58,639
When did it happen?

41
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:03,922
In the afternoon, after the rain.

42
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:08,639
Nobody was with her.

43
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:11,525
Nobody?

44
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:17,167
-You left her alone?
-I had to clean the yard.

45
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,964
So...

46
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:22,604
This is how we'll all end up.

47
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:25,118
Open the window!

48
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:32,565
What are you staring at?
The soul must leave the body.

49
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,761
I want everything proper.

50
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:45,637
The ceremony, the guests,
we'll heat up the fire.

51
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:52,202
Close her eyes, Ulrika.

52
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,762
I don't know how, daddy.

53
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:27,965
Whoa!

54
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:30,723
What held you, man?

55
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:33,359
Here, this is for you.

56
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:38,486
-Hm, a good smoke.
-It's for you, eh?

57
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:42,556
Old Florian was begging for some,
but got nothing.

58
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:45,116
You are a good man, Gusta.

59
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:49,366
-You'll have more work today.
-Today? No way.

60
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:54,399
Look, man!
The girl is almost a woman now.

61
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:57,719
Where does she sleep? Here with you?

62
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:01,637
Don't look at the girl, look there.

63
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:04,084
O Virgin Mary...

64
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:09,487
-She's gone.
-You'll get a drink,

65
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:11,955
and ride to town, for the priest.

66
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,958
When did it happen?

67
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:31,526
-People, don't! Stop it!
-Come on! Let's break the door!

68
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:12,447
<i>-Don't beat me!
-(in Polish) What are you doing?</i>

69
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,996
<i>-Please!
-Don't yell when thieving</i>

70
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:24,206
<i>-Where are you from?
-I got lost.</i>

71
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:29,523
At the Breslaw train station.
There was an air raid.

72
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:31,644
<i>And what are you doing here?</i>

73
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:37,483
<i>-I am going home. To Ostruzna.
-That's a long way.</i>

74
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:42,798
<i>Come. You can sleep in the stall.
I'll wake you up in the morning.</i>

75
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:46,360
I will chop the wood
and bring water for you.

76
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:48,683
<i>Look at yourself, no strength
in you.</i>

77
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:51,841
<i>What about the shoes? Have you
been with the army?</i>

78
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:55,596
Not me sir, never. They wouldn't
take me anywhere.

79
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:59,362
<i>-We are these volkspeople.
-Good for you.</i>

80
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,480
<i>It would be worse,
if they took away your soul.</i>

81
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,205
<i>Wait here.</i>

82
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:26,559
<i>-Son? Where are you?
-Here.</i>

83
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:29,675
<i>There.</i>

84
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:47,167
<i>Good night.</i>

85
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,319
Prr!

86
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,717
Welcome, pastor.

87
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:33,125
Come, let me help you.

88
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:37,199
Who is this?

89
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:42,242
-Will you help me too?
-We need to hide her.

90
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:47,441
Image, they wanted to shave her
head clean in Kolstejn.

91
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:51,156
So i figured it would
be a shame, eh?

92
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,839
-Tylda.
-Tylda...

93
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:59,118
Here... come.

94
00:12:00,527 --> 00:12:02,802
-Eh?
-Good.

95
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:17,320
-Take the coat off, it's wet.
-I'll close the window.

96
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:22,276
This is Tylda, Ulrika. She
well help us wash your mum.

97
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:26,042
-What about the pastor?
-God knows, my girl.

98
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,761
The Germans took him to
a concentration camp.

99
00:12:28,887 --> 00:12:31,037
Tylda: Man, it's cold here.

100
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:35,724
There. It will warm you up.

101
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:41,755
Get some water and go to bed.

102
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:46,277
I will not be inviting a German
pastor to my house.

103
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:49,160
-I will spend the last night with mum.
-Right.

104
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:52,239
Here, drink with us. To your mum.

105
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,797
Are you deaf, damn you?

106
00:12:55,047 --> 00:12:57,436
-Get out of here!
-I don't want to!

107
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:02,407
-Let's get her clothed before she goes stiff.
-Rena! Get her!

108
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:06,366
-Don't let her touch my mum!
-Get out of here!

109
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:18,199
Now.

110
00:13:22,487 --> 00:13:24,239
Sit elsewhere.

111
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:33,083
Rena, come.

112
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:03,083
Damn you, Habiger, have
you gone mad?

113
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:12,645
Ulrika! Open the door!

114
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:17,287
My girl. My little girl.

115
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:21,921
Forgive me. Forgive me, please.

116
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:26,646
Look, I have, I will have new
clothes tailored for you.

117
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:42,795
<i>[polsky]
Is that you, son?</i>

118
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,365
-Gustl?
-Yeah?

119
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:05,279
You go ahead.

120
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:09,997
You stay here, Ulrika.

121
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,601
We take the bottom way,
through the moor.

122
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:16,566
Come here! Rena! Rena!

123
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:22,966
Are you deaf?

124
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:28,205
One more howl and I will kick you!

125
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:49,245
Florian?

126
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,200
<i>[polsky]
Hey dog!</i>

127
00:17:02,247 --> 00:17:05,080
<i>They will steal you one day.</i>

128
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,723
You did not understand
what I said?

129
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:32,647
-Is it worth it, beating her like that?
-Leave that up to me.

130
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:35,286
Someone has to teach her obedience.

131
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:42,200
Alfred, the cart will not fit in.

132
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:43,885
Don't worry.

133
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:46,322
We'll carry her. She was not heavy.

134
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:13,242
Do not fear me and do not worry.

135
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:15,802
Maybe I can help you.

136
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,443
Here, put a nail in this too!

137
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,167
Florian would never have prayed this.

138
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:46,961
He was a Seventh day adventist.

139
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,997
Come, Krasula, come.

140
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,479
-Hi.
-Hi.

141
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:00,962
<i>Andenken an Gr?lich?</i>

142
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:04,327
<i>[in Polish]
Gr?lich. A remote monastery.</i>

143
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:07,287
<i>Up the on the borders.</i>

144
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:10,245
<i>They prepared their hideouts there
before the war ended.</i>

145
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:14,367
<i>They've got food and guns there.
Some of these hideouts must be here, too.</i>

146
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,407
<i>The forests should be searched.</i>

147
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:21,276
<i>It goes like a red blood line.
From the direction of Wroclaw.</i>

148
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:25,326
<i>-We don't have the manpower for that.
-Neither do we.</i>

149
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:28,877
-Roll call!
-The men have no food, lieutenant.

150
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:32,204
I hope we'll be back for diner
before dark?

151
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:36,447
Where do you think you are, sergeant?
In a restaurant?

152
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:37,960
Go!

153
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:02,795
-There is no-one to comb my hair now.
-What about the new one?

154
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:07,316
-I'd rather cut my hair and die.
-Don't talk blasphemously.

155
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:19,801
-How does one pray for the dead, Sister?
-Do you want to pray for your mom?

156
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:21,883
And for us, who are left, too.

157
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:25,405
We all are orphans.

158
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:30,005
Lord allmighty,

159
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:33,687
accept the soul
of your servant Elfriede...

160
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:38,283
-Lord allmighty, accept the soul...
-...that has left the sinful body,

161
00:22:38,327 --> 00:22:43,162
-to return to you in joy.
-...return to you in joy.

162
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:16,805
Would you like a drink, lieutenant?

163
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:25,718
Not a living soul in the woods,
yet these flowers are fresh.

164
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:31,242
-You come from this place?
-From around here.

165
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:35,077
And you lieutenant?

166
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:41,646
<i>On my horse</i>

167
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,318
<i>I will ride</i>

168
00:23:46,447 --> 00:23:51,202
<i>My sabre by my side</i>

169
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:56,357
<i>For the one</i>

170
00:23:57,047 --> 00:24:00,722
<i>I love the best</i>

171
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:07,159
<i>My heart is waiting...</i>

172
00:24:13,247 --> 00:24:16,842
Beautiful. Like a falling star.

173
00:24:19,087 --> 00:24:21,203
Where do you come from, Sister?

174
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:25,117
Have you ever been to Gr?lich?

175
00:24:26,687 --> 00:24:31,636
Mom used to go there. To pray to
the Virgin Mary for health.

176
00:24:31,807 --> 00:24:34,560
-She died anyway.
-Stop the blasphemy.

177
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:38,084
She's better now.

178
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:45,599
Sister, your feet hurt, you don't
know your way in the mountains.

179
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:47,797
Where else do you want to go?

180
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:14,640
Some celebration. What's
wrong with him?

181
00:25:16,007 --> 00:25:18,601
Alfred, eat! You have to eat!

182
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:24,246
-She hit me right in the heart.
-What is he saying?

183
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:28,838
Lizards, snakes and werewolfs,
not one's own children.

184
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:32,118
So.

185
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,915
His hands are shaking.

186
00:25:35,807 --> 00:25:37,445
Leave me alone!

187
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:39,882
Come, let's go up to the bedroom.

188
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:44,007
A guy whose hands are shaking,
is finished. Come!

189
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:46,043
-Stop it!
-Alright!

190
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:49,125
Let me tell you something.

191
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:53,287
Maybe people would like to know
where you're hiding, eh?

192
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:55,647
My hands are shaking,

193
00:25:55,647 --> 00:25:59,322
but I can still squeeze you
like a snake, you bastard!

194
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:05,283
Did you come to laugh at your
own father?

195
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:08,327
-Get out!
-Let her here, Alfred.

196
00:26:08,327 --> 00:26:10,079
The girl is sad.

197
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:17,522
I would like you to forgive
me, daddy.

198
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:20,280
-And you too, missis.
-Look at her!

199
00:26:20,327 --> 00:26:23,207
Laughing at one's
own face.

200
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,279
Stop it Gustl! I don't like this!

201
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:30,767
Man, I got carried away a bit.

202
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:34,327
I am no "man" for you, I am
a honest farmer!

203
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:37,717
On the Czech land!
Mobilised for the army, twice!

204
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:41,887
I'll kick you out to the cowshed
you piece of shit!

205
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:45,647
-Tylda: Alfred! This is a funeral!
-You shut up, too!

206
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,239
Or I'll smash your face!

207
00:26:47,287 --> 00:26:50,996
-the nun: Here, Ulrika.

208
00:26:53,407 --> 00:26:55,079
Virgin Mary protect us.

209
00:26:55,527 --> 00:26:59,487
I can take lots, but you, you'll
go straight to heaven.

210
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:02,524
-Will he go on with this?
-Until he gets exhausted and fall asleep.

211
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:04,643
Sometimes all night through.

212
00:27:04,847 --> 00:27:06,838
Take me with you.

213
00:27:09,607 --> 00:27:13,486
-Where?
-To the monastery. Gr?lich. Away from here!

214
00:27:16,807 --> 00:27:20,647
You won't see me here again, bastard!
Damn!

215
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:23,687
Nothing! No booze, no tobacco!

216
00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:28,087
You can rot here, with that bitch you
inherited from the German SS!

217
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:32,046
<i>The villages are on fire</i>

218
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:37,996
<i>and so is the heart</i>

219
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:44,324
<i>of a dying gipsy...</i>

220
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:49,202
Come... come!

221
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:53,679
-Come.
-Alfred!

222
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:58,245
Tylda: Stop it!

223
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:10,118
Alfred, leave me!

224
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:12,959
So what do you want here?

225
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:15,884
Go and wash yourself first.

226
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:26,166
How can you live here, in these
dreadful hills?

227
00:28:27,447 --> 00:28:29,438
I was born here.

228
00:28:32,007 --> 00:28:36,000
-Have you got any siblings?
-A brother. He lives in town.

229
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:39,564
Dad drove him out.

230
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,483
For a lonely girl, there is
no good in this world.

231
00:28:53,127 --> 00:28:56,881
We had this picture at
home, over my bed.

232
00:28:57,327 --> 00:28:59,318
I could watch it for days long,

233
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:01,756
when I was sick in bed.

234
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:12,365
-I used to sleep like this with mom.
-This can't be, Ulrika.

235
00:29:14,047 --> 00:29:15,605
Why?

236
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:18,119
I can't.

237
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:24,799
Doesn't matter.

238
00:29:25,527 --> 00:29:27,165
I'll lay down on the floor.

239
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:31,800
-Where are you going?
-To bring a blanket.

240
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:38,846
<i>and so is the bleeding heart</i>

241
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:42,085
<i>of a dying gypsy</i>

242
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:45,007
<i>who was he, the gypsy...</i>

243
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:53,679
-Sister...

244
00:30:50,687 --> 00:30:52,564
Sister?

245
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:00,804
Sister?

246
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,598
Alfred Habiger?

247
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:50,205
What's wrong with you?
Still sleeping?

248
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:55,886
I buried my wife yesterday. I had
a reason to drink.

249
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:58,364
You always do.

250
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:08,884
Shame on you, Habiger.
Such a pighouse here.

251
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:19,799
Look after the cow, it's pregnant.

252
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:26,685
Old Florian was killed yesterday.

253
00:32:27,087 --> 00:32:28,884
-Polish Florian?
-Right.

254
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:32,444
Thank you, mr. Lasica.

255
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:36,840
You have an understanding for
fellow men.

256
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:39,407
Watch out, Habiger,

257
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:43,764
A new gang has come from Silesia.
And your wife was a German.

258
00:32:48,527 --> 00:32:50,199
So what?

259
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:54,487
I kicked my son out of the house when
he came with a nazi flag.

260
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:58,002
-My wife has nothing to do with it.
-I'm warning you.

261
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:03,726
In this weather, they'll be attracted to
farmhouses like wolves.

262
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,045
Did he look for me?

263
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:27,280
-They killed Florian.
-Whom? -Get dressed.

264
00:33:28,087 --> 00:33:32,797
Let's go before someone steals it.
Florian had 300 kg of potatoes stored there.0

265
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:51,679
German?

266
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:55,957
<i>-Bist Deutsch?
-I can speak Czech.</i>

267
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:02,645
How did you get here?

268
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:04,999
What do you care?

269
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:14,961
-Quiet!

270
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:19,237
-What are you afraid of?
-They'll kill me if they find me.

271
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:21,365
The soldiers?

272
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:25,404
You have a high fever.

273
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:31,039
Don't worry, I'll hide you here
and get you some food.

274
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:36,519
How far is it to Ostruzna? Do
you know where it is?

275
00:34:37,087 --> 00:34:39,647
Two hours by train, at least.

276
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:44,718
Do you know someone there?

277
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:50,238
-What is your name?
-Ulrika. And you?

278
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,604
Stop staring and help us!

279
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:20,718
God bless.

280
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:26,482
-Light the watch candle.
-Don't worry.

281
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:35,123
That's the right blanket for winter.

282
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:38,958
I'd rather go to bed.

283
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:46,445
Ulrika...

284
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:52,239
-This is for you.
-Someone's outside, dad.

285
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:06,680
Blessed be our lord Jesus Christ.

286
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:15,277
-Man, what is this.
-Will you let us stay overnight?

287
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:19,806
If you are a christian. Just
until the storm goes away.

288
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:26,276
I will not deny those in need.

289
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:30,598
Come!

290
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:36,727
Put your stuff over there
and join us here.

291
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:40,720
It's warm here, you'll get some
food and we'll talk.

292
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:58,764
That used to be.

293
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:03,603
We're tired. Send your daughter
with the food.

294
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:09,042
-Where are you from? You speak Czech
so well.  - from Gr?lich.

295
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:10,919
Gr?llich, I know it.

296
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:15,805
We were building the bunkers there
before the war began.

297
00:37:15,927 --> 00:37:18,600
And my wife used to go there for prayers.

298
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:21,083
Let us change our clothes.

299
00:37:41,287 --> 00:37:45,121
''Judita and Herman.''
This must be stolen from the Jews.

300
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:52,527
What kind of a man would reject
a shelter for these poor things?

301
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:54,358
They have a bag full of it.

302
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:22,922
-Ah!

303
00:38:25,487 --> 00:38:26,967
Anything wrong?

304
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:33,643
Have you got food?

305
00:38:45,647 --> 00:38:48,207
-I'll help you.
-Leave the light here and go.

306
00:38:52,647 --> 00:38:54,558
Who could that be?

307
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:58,516
I'm deaf, I am going nowhere.

308
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:05,282
Have you locked the door?

309
00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:22,564
Let's welcome the guests, then.

310
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,557
-Who is it?
-Ulrika!

311
00:39:36,887 --> 00:39:38,320
[in German:]Quiet! Or I'll shoot you dead!

312
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:46,437
-Where is your dad? -Upstairs.
-How come you don't sleep yet?

313
00:39:56,527 --> 00:40:00,679
We we weren't expecting you, mr.Lasica,
in this kind of weather.

314
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:04,477
You weren't? Who were you expecting then?

315
00:40:06,967 --> 00:40:09,197
Nobody. Come on in.

316
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,843
I'll refill the oil.

317
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:18,287
Come and dry yourself. You're all wet.

318
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:33,555
What scared you so much?

319
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:43,962
You're having a good time, Reno, eh?

320
00:40:48,887 --> 00:40:52,766
This is old Florian's Bible.
Dad was plundering, eh?

321
00:40:53,927 --> 00:40:58,239
Do you have any visitors?
There was light in the old bar room.

322
00:41:01,487 --> 00:41:05,087
-Mr.Lasica...
-Ah!

323
00:41:15,927 --> 00:41:17,758
Is that you?

324
00:41:18,487 --> 00:41:21,001
How did you get here, Tylda?

325
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,121
Come, I won't bite you.

326
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:30,400
Believe me, mr. Lasica. I've quit
doing that thing with men.

327
00:41:31,327 --> 00:41:36,162
-It's all over, I want my peace now.
-Good for you.

328
00:41:37,727 --> 00:41:41,766
Be good to the young one, will you?
Or else...

329
00:41:56,607 --> 00:41:58,996
What's with you, Habinger?

330
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:02,481
Why haven't you prepared any food?

331
00:42:04,047 --> 00:42:06,117
Do I have to do everything by myself?

332
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:12,437
Get some smoked meat and bacon.

333
00:42:20,487 --> 00:42:23,718
How come you're coming so late?

334
00:42:28,927 --> 00:42:32,715
The storm caught me on my way to Stolny.

335
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:38,037
So?

336
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:44,882
Is this your praying book now?

337
00:42:45,287 --> 00:42:48,438
-You won't do what I told you?
-I am afraid to go there.

338
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:51,439
I'll get going.

339
00:42:52,647 --> 00:42:54,603
Once the storm is over.

340
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:57,116
Why? Where would you go?

341
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:01,842
We'll sit, drink some, sing some.

342
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:14,116
You can stay overnigt, if
you want to.

343
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:19,640
We're the same people, aren't we?

344
00:43:20,927 --> 00:43:22,838
Well.

345
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:27,837
You know how to sell your
goods, man.

346
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,242
What was that?

347
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:38,246
What would it be? Mice.

348
00:43:40,447 --> 00:43:43,757
There's plenty of room here,
if you wanted to...

349
00:43:43,847 --> 00:43:46,520
I'm on business, Tylda.

350
00:43:49,487 --> 00:43:52,797
-So long, then.
-Uncle... -Yes?

351
00:43:53,607 --> 00:43:55,563
Uncle, stay with us.

352
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:59,403
Take it easy, girl.

353
00:43:59,727 --> 00:44:01,683
Don't worry.

354
00:44:12,647 --> 00:44:15,923
You shouldn't go, mr. Lasica.

355
00:44:16,047 --> 00:44:17,844
Not in this kind of weather.

356
00:44:18,247 --> 00:44:20,124
I am used to.

357
00:44:45,007 --> 00:44:50,525
-Are you planning to open a pub again?
-You'd be the only customer.

358
00:44:50,767 --> 00:44:52,644
Aim the light here!

359
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:55,997
Don't talk like that, Habiger.

360
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:58,766
It's peace now. New people will come.

361
00:44:58,847 --> 00:45:01,202
You have always had great beer here.

362
00:45:01,327 --> 00:45:04,319
-You'd make money here, man.
-Why should I?

363
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:09,919
My wife's dead, the boy is god knows
where and Ulrika will leave, too.

364
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:28,399
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?

365
00:45:31,247 --> 00:45:33,158
Don't know.

366
00:45:35,127 --> 00:45:37,322
I got burnt .

367
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:43,484
So, there is light at Berhof too.

368
00:45:44,247 --> 00:45:46,966
It used to be a great pub here.

369
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:49,517
I remember that.

370
00:45:50,287 --> 00:45:52,005
Those were some days.

371
00:45:55,847 --> 00:45:58,600
I may be too kind.

372
00:46:16,127 --> 00:46:19,005
You be good to the girl, alright!

373
00:46:21,287 --> 00:46:25,565
Of course, mr. Lasica.
She's the only thing left to me.

374
00:46:29,607 --> 00:46:31,563
So long then.

375
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:36,523
Good night.

376
00:46:51,007 --> 00:46:55,000
Reno, quiet, quiet.

377
00:47:43,525 --> 00:47:45,725
[German]Lord bless you, friends...

378
00:47:48,106 --> 00:47:49,906
[German]Someone is lying in your yard.
You better hide him somewhere,

379
00:47:50,106 --> 00:47:52,106
[German]or you'll be hanging for murder.

380
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:05,806
[German]Got a cigarette, daddy?

381
00:48:40,807 --> 00:48:42,684
Let us pray.

382
00:48:43,047 --> 00:48:45,845
We were visited by wild beasts,
not by men.

383
00:48:46,807 --> 00:48:51,198
Hail Mary, full of grace,

384
00:48:51,247 --> 00:48:54,527
<i>[German]Blessed art thou amongst women</i>

385
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:58,486
<i>[German]at the hour of our death, Amen.</i>

386
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:03,407
Habiger: Our Father,
Who art in heaven,

387
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:06,207
hallowed be Thy name;
Thy kingdom come;

388
00:49:06,207 --> 00:49:08,887
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread;

389
00:49:08,887 --> 00:49:13,324
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us...

390
00:49:13,106 --> 00:49:15,106
[German]You better let your god sleep!

391
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:20,040
... but deliver us from evil.
Amen.

392
00:49:22,106 --> 00:49:24,306
[German]Say goodbye!

393
00:49:26,207 --> 00:49:28,198
-Daddy!
-My girl!

394
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:30,923
Forgive me...

395
00:49:39,207 --> 00:49:42,483
<i>I myself, always by myself</i>

396
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:45,845
<i>on my horse, my horse</i>

397
00:49:46,927 --> 00:49:50,476
<i>I myself, always by myself</i>

398
00:49:51,047 --> 00:49:54,047
<i>riding my horse...</i>

399
00:49:54,047 --> 00:49:56,567
-Miss!
-Just a minute.

400
00:49:56,567 --> 00:49:58,967
<i>A horse so fast</i>

401
00:49:58,967 --> 00:50:01,647
<i>A girl so pretty...</i>

402
00:50:01,647 --> 00:50:03,205
May I?

403
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:06,117
I don't dance, miss.

404
00:50:07,807 --> 00:50:12,198
You don't like this shithole either,
do you, lieutenant?

405
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:16,559
-They know how to have a good time.
-Rednecks.

406
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:20,567
Sergeant, you were assigned here
as a part of your punishment.

407
00:50:20,567 --> 00:50:23,007
-That's...
-Weren't you?

408
00:50:23,007 --> 00:50:25,475
We all were, lieutenant.

409
00:50:29,407 --> 00:50:33,446
I'll catch you!
I'll catch you!

410
00:50:35,247 --> 00:50:36,885
Hey, bro.

411
00:50:37,607 --> 00:50:40,724
-We know each other, don't we?
-Hardly.

412
00:50:41,327 --> 00:50:43,443
Not hardly, I know!

413
00:50:46,287 --> 00:50:50,280
From the prison in Mirov.

414
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:55,960
They were beating him up with a rubber
hose but he never said a word, right?

415
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:59,841
Wait, wait...
Don't run away!

416
00:51:00,007 --> 00:51:02,999
We'll have a shot together.

417
00:51:08,767 --> 00:51:11,645
Drunk: All has been stolen from here.

418
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:14,480
Houses, cattle, whores.

419
00:51:16,327 --> 00:51:20,286
<i>[Polish] It's forbidden to
enter the kitchen</i>

420
00:51:28,207 --> 00:51:31,722
May I open a food can in here?

421
00:51:38,407 --> 00:51:40,557
Provisions?

422
00:51:44,527 --> 00:51:47,485
<i>-I have got Camel fags, too.
-How much?</i>

423
00:51:48,247 --> 00:51:50,966
I'd do you for free.

424
00:51:58,887 --> 00:52:01,879
Not married or engaged?

425
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:05,000
<i>What good is it for?</i>

426
00:52:11,207 --> 00:52:14,677
What do you yell, you drunk.
It's half past four.

427
00:52:15,447 --> 00:52:17,722
Policeman Lasica has been killed.

428
00:52:25,127 --> 00:52:27,846
-Got to go.
-God.

429
00:52:28,207 --> 00:52:30,516
Let me through the back door.

430
00:52:31,967 --> 00:52:35,847
<i>-[outside] Where did you find him?
-You didn't even tell me your name.</i>

431
00:52:35,847 --> 00:52:39,367
[outside] Don't look at him, you'll
be sick.

432
00:52:39,367 --> 00:52:41,483
There is no point in that.

433
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:50,565
Sorry.

434
00:53:11,967 --> 00:53:14,037
I'll get them for this.

435
00:54:08,687 --> 00:54:12,040
[In German]Hey, young one, can you
wash my bra too?

436
00:54:43,807 --> 00:54:45,718
Detlev!

437
00:55:01,447 --> 00:55:03,278
Drink.

438
00:55:18,047 --> 00:55:21,517
Don't bury me here. Promise me.

439
00:55:21,887 --> 00:55:24,560
Stop it. You'll be alright.

440
00:55:24,807 --> 00:55:27,879
My name is Helt. Erich Helt.

441
00:55:28,807 --> 00:55:32,402
-Will you remember it?
-What is this?

442
00:55:36,287 --> 00:55:37,640
[In German]Help me!

443
00:55:44,847 --> 00:55:46,280
Untie me!

444
00:55:47,007 --> 00:55:49,082
[In German]Untie him!

445
00:56:00,727 --> 00:56:05,562
We have a family house in Ostruzna,
right across from the pub.

446
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:10,396
Number 32. Will you remember it?

447
00:56:11,647 --> 00:56:13,763
You'll be fine, Erich.

448
00:56:14,887 --> 00:56:19,881
-I'll get medicine from town.
-Promise you'll take me there.

449
00:56:20,207 --> 00:56:23,279
Even if I died.

450
00:57:29,927 --> 00:57:31,838
There.

451
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:35,798
Ne.

452
00:57:48,567 --> 00:57:50,159
Wimp.

453
00:57:50,407 --> 00:57:54,958
You can only kill people. An
animal is too much for you.

454
00:58:29,687 --> 00:58:31,405
[Ulrika sings in German]

455
00:59:17,727 --> 00:59:20,002
A German song. Did you mother
teach you that?

456
00:59:25,767 --> 00:59:27,917
We had to come here.

457
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:31,403
For Erich. He'd die in the woods.

458
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:34,358
I don't trust you anymore.

459
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:40,002
Nuns wear a crucifix on their
neck, not like you!

460
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:52,003
My dad had always wanted a son.

461
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:55,960
He wanted an army officer.

462
00:59:57,287 --> 00:59:59,437
He never forgave me for being born.

463
01:00:01,047 --> 01:00:03,720
But I'm no worse than a son.

464
01:00:04,607 --> 01:00:06,438
I did it.

465
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:18,482
I must take them to Germany.
They'll learn a different life.

466
01:00:20,687 --> 01:00:22,598
They'll forget.

467
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:32,647
Do you understand?

468
01:00:58,367 --> 01:01:02,406
Habiger: Come on, let's eat
before they finish their prayer.

469
01:01:05,647 --> 01:01:10,004
Eat what you can, so that
it's over faster.

470
01:01:10,247 --> 01:01:12,920
We'll kill the kow before winter,

471
01:01:15,167 --> 01:01:18,682
And after Christmas we'll be
dying of hunger.

472
01:01:56,927 --> 01:02:00,237
It makes no sense, Ulrika.
The tea won't help him.

473
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:03,279
He needs medicine. Without it
he'll die.

474
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:06,158
Habiger: Attention handgrenade!

475
01:02:25,957 --> 01:02:28,957
[In German]Should I kill you straight away?

476
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:34,487
Stop it, boy. I am too tired.

477
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:41,787
[In German]Your fathers have lost the war
and you're trying to fix it?

478
01:02:42,787 --> 01:02:44,887
[In German]The war is not over yet.

479
01:02:45,987 --> 01:02:50,087
[In German]Hitler is dead. Germany is no more.
You wimp.

-[hudba]
-Ulrika: No! No! No!

481
01:02:56,767 --> 01:03:04,242
No! No! No! No...

482
01:03:23,807 --> 01:03:26,879
What are you doing? Why are you
provoking them?

483
01:03:29,527 --> 01:03:32,405
The little puke makes me want
to stop shaving.

484
01:03:32,527 --> 01:03:35,280
Talk, talk, thas all you can!
Ouch!

485
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,480
[In German]The cripple is nothing but a burden.

486
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,480
[In German]I want away, away from this house.

487
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,480
[In German]We have to find our troops.

488
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,680
[In German]God knows how many of them
are hiding in the woods.

489
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,680
[In German]Guys, take me home.

490
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:24,880
[In German]It's just a few
kilometres. Don't leave me here.

491
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,880
[In German]Home?

492
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,980
[In German]I have no home!

493
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,180
[In German]We were swearing that, remember?

494
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:36,380
[In German]Until our troops come back.

495
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:51,580
[In German]Shut up.

496
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:12,167
[In German]Calm down, Erich.

497
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:17,367
[In German]This is your Mercedes.

498
01:05:18,367 --> 01:05:21,367
[In German]I will not take it from you this time.

499
01:05:22,367 --> 01:05:25,367
[In German]Don't cry.

500
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,567
[In German]What do we do with him?

501
01:05:34,567 --> 01:05:36,567
[In German]We'll accept what comes.

502
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:49,767
[In German]I still have saccharin.

503
01:06:48,067 --> 01:06:50,647
[In German]Bedtime, children.

504
01:07:12,647 --> 01:07:15,847
[In German]Sister, tell us again

505
01:07:16,847 --> 01:07:19,847
[In German]the fairy tale about how
it was at home...

506
01:07:20,847 --> 01:07:26,047
[In German]Blessed house in the middle
of wide fields.

507
01:07:29,147 --> 01:07:33,347
[In German]Sand all the way to the horizon
and the lakes...

508
01:07:34,347 --> 01:07:39,347
[In German]An oak tree stands on every
crossroad.

509
01:07:41,347 --> 01:07:46,547
[In German]And there is bread and butter
under it.

510
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:51,847
[In German]A jug of milk,

511
01:07:52,847 --> 01:07:56,847
[In German]for every passer-by.

512
01:08:06,087 --> 01:08:10,922
You will receive medicines and
brith certificate. Don't forget.

513
01:08:34,087 --> 01:08:35,918
Ulrika...

514
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:40,206
[in German]

515
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:42,259
[in German]I'd rather be dead, my dear girl.

516
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,359
[in German]These are messages from the underworld.

517
01:10:00,727 --> 01:10:02,365
Are you all right?

518
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:07,559
[in German]Is anyone with you?

519
01:10:08,559 --> 01:10:12,559
[in German]Injections, sulphanamides,
calcium, ethanol.

[in German]By noon, there will be a basket
prepared for you in the church. Right?

522
01:10:26,967 --> 01:10:28,844
I will know when the bells ring.

523
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:31,559
[in German]They won't ring.

524
01:10:31,569 --> 01:10:34,559
[in German]Our troops took them, they
left only the funeral bell.

525

-That's too much.

534

535

-How many are you buying?
-Let me go!

541
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,924
Take some.

542
01:11:45,087 --> 01:11:49,046
Don't worry..
Nobody will hurt you here.

543
01:11:49,887 --> 01:11:51,927
I don't know what you want.

544

-I've just come to buy bread.
-Hm.

545
01:11:55,927 --> 01:11:57,599

-You like it in the hills?
-I was born there.

And you don't bake your own bread?

548

Would you like to do something

549
01:12:25,447 --> 01:12:27,517
For whom?

550
01:12:41,647 --> 01:12:44,798
Sir, there is blood on your door.

551
01:12:52,007 --> 01:12:53,918
Oh, that's nothing.

552
01:12:59,287 --> 01:13:01,755
Somebody hit his nose.

553
01:13:05,567 --> 01:13:07,000
Close your ears.

554
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:18,484
Listen, seargant, you are on your
way to court martial!

555
01:13:18,647 --> 01:13:22,242
I don't care if he hits his head
against the wall by himself!

556
01:13:22,327 --> 01:13:25,319
Have him taken to Olomouc, now!

557
01:13:29,647 --> 01:13:32,002
You can listen now again.

558
01:13:34,407 --> 01:13:36,204
What is your name?

559
01:13:37,447 --> 01:13:39,165
Ulrika.

560
01:13:39,287 --> 01:13:43,041
You have beautiful eyes.
I like them.

561
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:46,158
What do you know about werewolves?

562
01:13:47,327 --> 01:13:49,158
About what?

563
01:13:50,247 --> 01:13:53,045
The retreating Germans have put
together gangs of killers.

564
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:55,362
They call themselves werewolves.

565
01:13:56,407 --> 01:14:00,195
-For them, the war is not over yet.
Understand?    -Yes.

566
01:14:02,927 --> 01:14:06,124
The bread will be sold at eleven.
May I go now?

567
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:22,478
You have half an hour time, Ulrika.

568
01:14:28,887 --> 01:14:30,798
Want some chocolate?

569
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:47,167
-He is a nazi, Ulrika!
-Let me go!

570
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:51,638
-The real preast was sent to KZ-camp!
-Let me go away!

571
01:14:56,687 --> 01:15:00,567
[in broken Czech]You let the girl go?
She will the the werewolves about me.

572
01:15:00,567 --> 01:15:03,081
It has been coded under my supervision.

573
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,567
[German]I have written the report

574
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
[German]like you have ordered me, lieutenant!

575
01:15:07,287 --> 01:15:08,959
You can go now.

576
01:15:10,059 --> 01:15:13,959
But, wait, lieutenant, sir!

577
01:15:20,127 --> 01:15:22,287
Get the medicines. Do it.

578
01:15:22,287 --> 01:15:25,006
Even if you were to steal them
from the army depot.

579
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:27,635
They don't have them. Not even
for our own men.

580
01:15:28,087 --> 01:15:30,681
You have 70 minutes!

581
01:16:24,207 --> 01:16:25,799
Father!

582
01:17:15,007 --> 01:17:16,838
Did you like it?

583
01:17:17,447 --> 01:17:20,047
Our teacher never played like this.

584
01:17:20,047 --> 01:17:22,959
I believe you.
Today, people dance to this.

585
01:17:23,007 --> 01:17:24,884
Boogie-woogie. You know it?

586
01:17:29,647 --> 01:17:34,038
Come to the saturday dance.
I will teach you.

587
01:17:36,327 --> 01:17:38,238
I can't, sir.

588
01:17:40,807 --> 01:17:43,401
The war is over, Ulrika.

589
01:17:43,527 --> 01:17:48,726
People want to have fun. They
need one another.

590
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:52,284
Will you be here now in
place of the priest?

591
01:17:56,367 --> 01:17:58,164
The priest,

592
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:00,718
the teacher.

593
01:18:01,327 --> 01:18:03,602
What do I know? Whatever is needed.

594
01:18:06,367 --> 01:18:09,484
Did you know mr. Lasnica? The policeman?

595
01:18:10,167 --> 01:18:12,635
When was the last time you saw him?

596
01:18:13,767 --> 01:18:16,600
I don't know. I don't remember.

597
01:18:30,767 --> 01:18:32,678
How many of them are there?
Speak!

598
01:18:32,887 --> 01:18:35,037
Where are they?
Speak!

599
01:18:42,807 --> 01:18:47,483
Do you know what they did to
your neighbour, old Florian?

600
01:18:48,127 --> 01:18:52,245
They nailed him to the door!
And the burned the woodcuter in Stolne!

601
01:18:52,287 --> 01:18:54,721
None of this is Erich's fault!

602
01:18:56,407 --> 01:18:58,159
Who's Erich?

603
01:19:03,327 --> 01:19:06,444
A cousin... from Ostruzna.

604
01:19:07,247 --> 01:19:09,761
He's at our place, for the holidays.

605
01:19:17,687 --> 01:19:23,159
I know. It's nobody's fault here.
I have gotten used to it.

606
01:19:31,927 --> 01:19:33,679
Take it! Take it to them!

607
01:19:33,807 --> 01:19:35,923
Let them pack it up and go!

608
01:19:36,487 --> 01:19:38,682
Let them go to hell and stay there.

609
01:19:40,327 --> 01:19:42,204
Is it possible?

610
01:19:53,567 --> 01:19:58,083
I just want to get them out of this
district. I just want peace.

611
01:20:11,047 --> 01:20:14,357
Are they here with you or
waiting in the forest?

612
01:20:18,927 --> 01:20:20,724
I am alone here.

613
01:20:25,647 --> 01:20:28,719
It will be dark before you
get all the way there.

614
01:20:29,567 --> 01:20:32,525
I can go by night. By the brook.

615
01:20:35,847 --> 01:20:37,724
Ulrika...

616
01:20:55,127 --> 01:20:57,004
<i>[In German]Stop!</i>

617
01:22:03,047 --> 01:22:04,275
Bebebe!

618
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:22,562
Ulrika, who have you met
down there?

619
01:22:24,967 --> 01:22:26,844
Me... nobody.

620
01:22:29,367 --> 01:22:32,359
I spoke to the priest.

621
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:34,797
Look into my eyes.

622
01:22:35,527 --> 01:22:39,645
-Who did you tell about us?
-Nobody, sister.

623
01:22:47,847 --> 01:22:50,122
To lie is a sin, Ulrika.

624
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:06,087
I's alright my girtl. Everyone
becomes a traitor, one day.

625
01:23:06,087 --> 01:23:07,807
I didn't tell anyone!

626
01:23:07,807 --> 01:23:11,356
I said the medicine is for
my cousin!

627
01:23:11,847 --> 01:23:13,838
They believed me!

628
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,038
Having one's own fatherland is
the greatest sin.

629
01:23:34,887 --> 01:23:37,481
Would you like to pray with me?

630
01:23:39,727 --> 01:23:41,558
Here?

631
01:23:41,847 --> 01:23:45,127
For the last time.
So God will forgive you,

632
01:23:45,127 --> 01:23:47,687
and save both you and Erich.

633
01:23:49,087 --> 01:23:51,601
I can pray with you.

634
01:23:51,687 --> 01:23:55,396

Hallowed be thy name.
