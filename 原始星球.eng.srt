00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:44,749
Based on the novel "Oms en s¨¦rie" by Stefan Wul

2
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,540
She's stopped moving.

3
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,665
Now we can't play with her any more.

4
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,332
Careful! It's Master Sinh.

5
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:39,582
Look, father.A female Om and her baby.

6
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,332
Is she dead?

7
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,290
I'm afraid so, Tiwa.

8
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,124
Why is the baby making a noise?

9
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,249
Maybe because it's frightened or hungry.

10
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,624
We can't leave him here.May I keep him?

11
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,832
Let me, father. I'll take care of him.

12
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,707
All right, Tiwa,we can't let this animal die.

13
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:06,624
That was my first encounter with the Grand Master of the Draags.

14
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,582
Mother! Mother!

15
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,999
Look at the little Om. Isn't he sweet?

16
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,415
His mother's dead. I want to keep him.

17
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,790
He's very pretty, Tiwa.

18
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:10,124
Tiwa, you've disturbedyour mother's meditation.

19
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,582
If you can't discipline that animal, I'll have to take it away from you.

20
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:19,624
But Father, he ran off. He needs a collar.

21
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,915
Learn to use it. Watch.

22
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,165
Now put the animal down.

23
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,415
It's fun. Let me try.

24
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:46,082
Not so fast. The animal is delicate.

25
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,624
You might hurt it.

26
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,999
What are you going to call it?

27
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,790
Tiwa, like me.

28
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:02,540
That's not an Om's name. Call it Trusty or Speed.

29
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,957
Look at him wriggle, the little terror!

30
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:12,415
I'm going to call him Terr.

31
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,082
I was forgotten.

32
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:31,707
A baby om is nothing compared to meditation.

33
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:35,499
This strange ritual to which my masters devoted most of their time

34
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:39,540
and seemed to be their main concern.

35
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:18,040
Despite our forecasts, the housing unit factory on our Uva at Goham

36
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,082
has not met production levels.

37
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,874
The machines show unusual wear

38
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,290
and this seems to have caused the delay.

39
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:32,665
- Master Taj, can you explain? - We don't yet know the reason.

40
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:38,832
In the meantime, we'll use reserve machines to meet the schedule.

41
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,457
I don't understand.

42
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,832
The machines have worked perfectly up till now.

43
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,374
Have you had the same problem on other Uvas?

44
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:55,540
Only machines from our space flight to Planet Antax 4

45
00:08:55,666 --> 00:09:00,374
had some trouble completing their program.

46
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,957
Master Sinh, our scientists

47
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:08,540
explain this loss as a break in the sensory compensation system.

48
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:13,332
Our scientists also note animals brought from Planet Terra

49
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:18,165
have a high level of savibon and intelligence.

50
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,290
I am not sure that is true.

51
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:25,415
It's clear that this animal adapts rather well.

52
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,540
But is that intelligence?

53
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:33,749
The little pet you are stroking between meditations

54
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,624
may well surprise you one day.

55
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,957
Films made on Terra show many traces of organised life.

56
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,040
The ability to adapt, Master Ka,

57
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,332
may indicate an advanced evolution.

58
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:20,207
Oms have a much shorter life span than us.

59
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,915
But they reproduce much more rapidly.

60
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,957
If this animal is intelligent, Master Sinh

61
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,040
we haven't yet been able to establish this.

62
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:34,749
What we have established, however, is the considerable damage

63
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:38,165
caused by Oms on the Uvas of Jext and Telez.

64
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:42,040
The number of tame Oms is easy to control.

65
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,790
But wild Oms probably exist

66
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,707
in much larger numbers than is generally acknowledged.

67
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:51,874
We de-om the enclaves of wild Oms every three cycles.

68
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,915
But I wonder if that is often enough.

69
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,374
Few weapons have a long-term effect.

70
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,040
Drastic measures must be taken.

71
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,707
New ways to fight them are currently being researched. 73

72
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,207
But I doubt that they will suffice.

73
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,999
Tiwa, go and play somewhere else.

74
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:28,415
I'm very sorry. Imagination was so rich today too.

75
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,957
This animal is a pest!

76
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:34,249
Not at all. Our children all love those animals.

77
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,957
I grew up fast in that slow world.

78
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,540
A Draag week was equivalent to one of my years.

79
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:38,665
I was just a live plaything who sometimes dared to rebel.

80
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,165
Tiwa loved me.

81
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:55,707
Terr loves Tiwa. Repeat

82
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:42,290
Tiwa received her education through a headphone.

83
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:46,040
Its lessons cut directly into the brain,

84
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:50,499
and were engraved in the memory for ever.

85
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:56,457
"Our planet Ygam has just one satellite:

86
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,415
"the Savage Planet.

87
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,249
"It is uninhabited and is used for meditation.

88
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,665
"Ygam is divided into several Uvas.

89
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:08,082
"Two Uvas, Strom and Yot, are natural and symmetrical.

90
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,707
"Urtana is the longest Uva

91
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,957
"and is completely covered with blue assanic blocks.

92
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:19,707
"Its temperatures range from 8 to 243 laiks

93
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,790
"making it impossible to exploit.

94
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:27,540
"Our Uva, Goham, has a fepular inland sea

95
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,499
"stabilising the openosh at about 20 laiks.

96
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,874
"Fixation blocks offset pontic rebation.

97
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,249
"Er-shaped globes regulate pressure.

98
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:42,957
"All Uvas undergo a cycle of three seasons of equal length.

99
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,790
"The season of garus crystallisation..."

100
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:51,957
Due to some fault, I was also able to acquire the Draags' knowledge.

101
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:57,832
"When the earth peels, an intense vegetation replaces all nosks

102
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,165
"with similar nosks."

103
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,874
I liked the lessons.

104
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,082
I tried to get the most out of them.

105
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,749
"The cliffs on the fepular sea

106
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:11,499
"are eroded by rains that often last for a long time..."

107
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,665
Tiwa, bring your animal over here.

108
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:18,499
Jurgal has got his here. We can have some fun.

109
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:22,707
I don't want him hurt. Jurgal's animal is insane!

110
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:26,415
He nearly tore his ears off the other day!

111
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:31,374
No, he won't damage your Om. Come and play!

112
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,124
Come and see!

113
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,499
Let's get Terr to fight, it will be more fun.

114
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,707
Terr will win. He's really wild.

115
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,415
Go fight!

116
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:56,415
- He can sing. - Terr sings well too.

117
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,290
Go on, sing, Terr!

118
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,874
- He'll strangle him! - I don't know what he's doing.

119
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,415
What a horrid animal!

120
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:16,040
"It is simple to see a tark's flayed muscles

121
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:19,207
"because the animal is easily skinned."

122
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:30,457
Can you hear the Om?

123
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,874
That's Tiwa's lesson.

124
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,499
She loves Terr so much that they are never apart.

125
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,957
Do you think he understands what he's saying?

126
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,082
I don't think so.

127
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:46,207
Anyway, I'll forbid Tiwa to keep the Om during Infos.

128
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:49,374
She has to take her studies seriously.

129
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,082
"Let us look at the liscinian muscle of a tark's leg.

130
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:56,874
"The liscinian muscle is a fleshy, fuliform vilok..."

131
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,707
"The molog is an enviparous animal.

"and the entire surface of their walls

134

"but gambous amalga, an artificial structure..."

138
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,124
Have you still got Terr with you for your Infos?

139
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,415
I told you not to.

140
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:39,624
Go back to the Omerie!

141
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:44,957
But he's not disturbing me, father. And he's so happy.

142
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:49,415
The Infos are for you. Go on, back to your work.

143
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:03,999
It was time for the Draag children to do their first meditation.

144
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:07,624
The initiation ceremony was a major step

145
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,415
on their road to knowledge.

146
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,374
For some time now Tiwa and I had been growing apart.

147
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,832
As she grew into her teens she gave up her playthings.

148
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:48,457
Deprived of the lessons I decided to run away.

149
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:25,874
Mother! I can't find Terr!

150
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,040
And my headphone's gone.

151
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,457
Use your bracelet then.

152
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,332
But if he's a long way away, it'll hurt him.

153
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:37,290
Put your bracelet on maximum!

154
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,082
Oh, no!

155
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:29,624
You're not very bright! Like all tame Oms.

156
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,290
- But you have a collar too. - It's a fake, to fool the Draags.

157
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:37,124
What's that?

158
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,165
The Draags invented it.

159
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,290
What?

160
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:43,415
The Draags made it.

161
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,415
Listen.

162
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:51,457

"Importantly, we are looking not only for festation groups..."

167
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:07,415
Don't be afraid, it's not dangerous.

168
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:15,249
Where are you taking it?

169
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:17,457
- I don't know. - Come with me.

170
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:27,082
My new friend took me to her people who lived hidden in the Big Tree

171
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:29,665
deep in an abandoned park.

172
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:37,624
I was a silly tame om

173
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:42,290
and my first contact with wild oms was not a great success.

174
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,207
Don't touch that case, it's a trap.

175
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,582
Since I had brought the headphone of knowledge to the Big Tree

176
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:27,790
the wizard opposed me from the start.

177
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,124
We've brought five cases, Chief.

178
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,915
What? Is that all?

179
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:36,290
One of the cases was a trap and Speed is dead.

180
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:38,874
He knew the case was a trap.

181
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,040
He's a tame Om, Chief.

182
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:46,040
He ran away with a Draag device. It taught him to read Draag writing.

183
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:48,749
I'm sure he can't read.

184
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:53,457
Does the tame Om know what's in these cases?

185
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:58,582
- In that one? - Yes, coloured powder.

186

193
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:46,790
- Why did you stop the Infos? - Draag knowledge is bad.

194
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:49,165
We Oms don't need it.

195
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:53,874
We are not tame Oms. It is a grave offence.

196
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,415
You must fight as the law stipulates.

197
00:36:57,541 --> 00:37:01,207
Bring the combat animals.

198
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:53,249
You are the winner.

199
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:58,249
Stay with the Oms of the Big Tree. You can be of use to us.

200
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:01,999
Tomorrow we set off on an expedition.

201
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:44,540
It was my first expedition to the Draags to steal food.

202
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:47,874
We came back loaded up.

203
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:06,082
Take heart, we're not far from the Big Tree now.

204
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,749
The Hollow-Bush bandits! Look out!

205
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:32,707
Why did they attack?

206
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:36,457
They're the Hollow-Bush bandits. Beware of them.

207
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:40,582
They're thieves from the other side of the park.

208
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:47,832
"The Great Zarek, 3000 cycles before Krowp

00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,249
The Oms are learning.

222
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:49,249
If only we had more headphones.

223
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,790
You are as knowledgeable as the Draags.

224
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:58,707
I'm only just learning to write.

225
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:00,790
Look.

226
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:17,832
Are you sure?

227
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:20,749
Are you sure you read it correctly?

228
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:24,915
Yes, "De-om" is written on all the park walls.

229
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:29,790
- What does it mean? - The Draags want to kill all the Oms.

230
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:35,999
Long ago I saw them de-om the park. It was horrible.

231
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:39,999
But we're not in any great danger in our tree.

232
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:42,415
What will we do?

233
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:46,832
- It had to come. - Anyway, we have time to prepare.

234
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:48,624
We'll post sentries.

235
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,915
The Draags are going to slaughter us.

236
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,499
They want to punish us for having stolen their knowledge.

237
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:57,374
Let us pray to the Savage Planet.

238
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,207
The sentries will warn us of the Draags' approach.

239
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,374
We shall see tomorrow.

240
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:36,582
What were you doing on our land?

241
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:43,290
I came to warn you. The Draags intend to de-om the park.

242
00:47:43,416 --> 00:47:48,124
De-om! You don't say! How do you know?

243
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,832
One of us read the writing on the walls.

244
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:55,957
Can Big Tree Oms read Draag writing now?

245
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:58,082
Don't listen to him!

246
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,165
It's a trap to get us out of the Hollow Bush.

247
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:03,624
You have to believe me! The Draags will de-om.

248
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,415
Take him away!

249
00:48:07,666 --> 00:48:10,124
Someone go and look at the walls.

250
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:36,165
- Listen! Draags! - Quiet!

251
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:50,665
- It smells of Oms here. - They're vermin.

252
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:53,999
The Masters should decontaminate the area more often.

253
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:57,540
It's fine to keep Oms as pets, they're fun.

254
00:52:57,666 --> 00:53:01,624
But all those wild Oms, they fight, they're dirty

255
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,790
and they reproduce at an alarming rate.

256
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:07,332
Look there's a nest in the gutter.

257
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:11,665
Look! A whole colony of them! Come on, let's exterminate them.

258
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:53,790
Chief is dead.

259
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:56,540
Stop blubbering like children.

260
00:53:56,666 --> 00:54:00,124
We must go where the Draags can't find us.

261
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:05,915
I know a place. I'll take you there.

262
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,207
This road leads to an abandoned rocket dump.

263
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:28,457
We'll be safe there.

264
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,415
I regret that we de-om only once every three cycles.

265
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:25,290
Recent events have shown this is unacceptable.

266
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:28,374
A Draag murdered! It's unbelievable.

267
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,624
Are we so weak that Oms can kill us so easily?

268
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:36,707
Wild Oms are much more numerous than we thought.

269
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:40,874
An examination of the body showed a large number of bites and wounds.

270
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,999
According to the Draag who managed to escape

271
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:46,749
the Oms were very numerous.

272
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:53,874
Every day wild Oms become bolder.

273
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,332
They reproduce at a terrifying rate.

274
00:56:56,458 --> 00:57:02,415
Master Sinh, it is disturbing that Telez Uva

275
00:57:02,541 --> 00:57:07,957
was not the only place that was very difficult to de-om.

276
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:12,290
Two other Uvas, Goham and Urtana,

277
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:15,165
have experienced similar problems.

278
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:18,207
In the de-omised park

279
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:22,165
we found two surprisingly well-organised lairs.

280
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:27,707
Most disturbing of all was that in one of the lairs

281
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:31,499
the boxes were sorted according to their contents,

282
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:33,540
but they weren't opened.

283
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:37,374
How could the Oms know what they contained?

284
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:41,707
Master Sinh, it's high time we instigate efficient measures.

285
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:45,082
I suggest we de-om the parks twice per cycle.

286
00:57:45,208 --> 00:57:50,082
I also request that the breeding and sale of tame Oms

287
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:52,624
be strictly regulated.

288
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,957
Too often they return to the wild

289
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:58,915
and swell the numbers of Oms living in the parks

290
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:00,832
and other isolated areas.

291
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:06,124
We must use the much discussed de-oming devices.

292
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,540
All wild Oms must be exterminated.

293
00:58:08,666 --> 00:58:13,290
And I put it to you - should we keep our tame Oms?

294
00:58:13,416 --> 00:58:18,290
It's wrong to believe Oms are merely vicious animals.

295
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:22,665
If we do, we may commit an error that has serious consequences.

296
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:58,790
Three seasons had passed on Ygam.

297
00:58:58,916 --> 00:59:01,749
That was the equivalent of 15 years for us.

298
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:15,874
The Draag rocket graveyard had long been abandoned.

299
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,499
There we built our city.

300
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:22,374
But it was the Savage Planet that we wanted to go to.

301
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,332
Many tame and wild oms joined us.

302
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:17,540
Knowledge acquired from the headphones

303
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:20,790
enabled us to use sophisticated technology

304
01:00:20,916 --> 01:00:24,540
to reduce Draag rocket components to our size.

305
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:38,874
"Trinur is a white metal that palsifies Matwar.

306
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,707
"Top-grade reculid gives it a remarkable metallic shine."

307
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:53,374
We have succeeded, Terr.

308
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,749
The first two rockets are ready for testing.

309
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:59,499
We just need to spend some time working on the others.

310
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:03,124
We must hurry. Many tame Om informers have warned us

311
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:06,207
that there will be a large-scale de-omisation.

312
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,957
They may know where we are.

313
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:40,249
We must send up our two rockets at once.

314
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:43,249
We have to see if we can live on the Savage Planet.

315
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:45,790
We can't wait any longer.

316
01:03:45,916 --> 01:03:49,582
It's a pity I can't go with you.

317
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:53,249
But I'm not afraid. I'm sure you'll succeed.

318
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:59,999
I know you will build a world where Oms can be happy

319
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:02,415
far away from the Draags.

320
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:05,124
The Savage Planet will be our planet,

321
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,582
a world for our children.

322
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:10,874
You must go.

323
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,540
You must hurry.

324
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:15,499
You must...

325
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:04,707
We had discovered the Draags' secret.

326
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:07,332
The Draags used their meditation spheres

327
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:11,415
to meet beings from other galaxies on the Savage Planet

328
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:14,665
and to hold strange nuptial rituals.

329
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:20,374
This union gave them the vital energy they needed

330
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:24,749
and guaranteed the survival of the species.

331
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:01,582
We were gripped by fear.

332
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:05,290
The statues' huge feet might damage our rockets.

333
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:17,665
By chance we had found the Draags' only weak point.

334
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,957
The de-omisation was halted on Ygam.

335
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,915
Never have the Draags been in such great danger.

336
01:08:10,041 --> 01:08:13,332
Our entire civilisation is threatened!

337
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:15,624
The Oms are taking revenge.

338
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:18,915
They have incredible scientific instruments.

339
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:23,499
- They must be stopped! - They must be exterminated!

340
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:26,040
It may be too late.

341
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:32,374
Neither Oms not Draags will profit from destruction.

342
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,665
We must try to make peace.

343
01:08:52,958 --> 01:08:56,540
"Since the Sinh era, the epoch of the Masters of Ygam,

344
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:59,874
"the Draag civilisation has undergone a remarkable evolution.

345
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,582
"Instructed by Draag philosophy and technology

346
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:08,874
"the Oms now provide the Draags with dynamic vitality

347
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,957
"and a new way of thinking.

348
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:16,207
"Our planet now has two satellites: one natural and one artificial.

349
01:09:16,333 --> 01:09:18,749
"The natural satellite, the Savage Planet,

350
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:21,915
"is kept for Draag meditation.

351
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:24,540
"The artificial one was made by the Oms.

352
01:09:24,666 --> 01:09:26,332
"They named it Terr..
