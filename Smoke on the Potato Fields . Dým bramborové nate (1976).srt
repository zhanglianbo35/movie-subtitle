So that I can be a head physician,

-I'm still sick.
-Come to see me then.

Oh no, my colleague,
it would do harm to me.

Until all my sickness are
in a balance,

Will you have some too?

Thank you, it was very good.

-He's come only to thank me.

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,630
I've invited him in.

If Vlach imagined it like that,
he's wrong.

-Why didn't he send his wife here?
-Petr, she has a little child.

-I won't serve to anyone.
-Nobody wants you to.

Wouldn't you mind doctor,
if we'd take a little detour?

I'll be back in a moment.

Well, too.

You really went mad 
because of Marketa, Ota.

192
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,320
How come you lent her
the service car when you know

193
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,675
that the girl even doesn't have
a driving license?

194

it tomorrow. Get in.

Yes.

-I would like strawberries.
-I can't do anything about it.

-That'll be 50.
-Because of a damn windshiled?

An unlocked car and 
worn-out tires.

when you left.

I'd like to make an apology,
doctor.

You don't have to.

My husband was sorry 
how he had treated you.

Of course, he hasn't brought 
the coal again, rascal.

Bye.

Be glad you don't 
have any children.

You're exaggerating
a little, mrs. Simon.

-Ota is no child anymore.
-I know.

Do you think I'm a gossip?

what worries are there
in this age.

unknown for me.

-A man never knows.
-Isn't it silly?

244

If you want only work with a shovel
someone could use you elsewhere.

Oh man.
That's not from your head.

He knows nothing.

In winter when the soil is frozen
it is hard to dig a grave.

Why do you still 
think on the worst?

250

It's always like that in life,
colleague.

Oh, not again.

Because of this hag I took
the Tejno cemetery, because it's too far.

was here in a week.

don't you need to pump your tyres?

she plays offended.

Good that you're here.

260
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,550
Otherwise she would invite me
for an apple roll.

261
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,150
You know it from Bible, don't you?
About the apples?

262

I'll go so I wouldn't 
stand in your way.

so that I can avoid it.

Good evening.

268
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,640
I need to talk about something,
doctor.

269
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,358
Well, please.

270
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,430
Please. About what?

271
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,151
It concerns my wife.

272
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,720
You should know,

273
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,475
that we've always lived with Pavla
in a proper marriage.

274
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,678
It started to creak
just recently.

275
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,313
-But I don't...
-I enjoyed the time before the wedding.

276
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,029
Today I am rather for a family.

277
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,040
And I don't mind Pavla graduated

278
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,149
and that she's a teacher.

279
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,160
I don't mind such things.

280
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,758
There are other things
to care about in marriage.

281
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,680
When a woman wants a child
and still doesn't have it

282
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,638
she wants it still more.
But...

283
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,837
Don't think 
I don't know how to.

284
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,080
Some of those 
I met before Pavla

285
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,629
got married and had children
afterwards. Even two.

286
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,549
So I say to myself sometimes

287
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,396
if I did choose right afterall.

288
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,556
How long are you together?

289
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,638
Over two years.

290
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,516
I'd wish her the child.

291
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,153
And me too.

292
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,956
But... what if 
it's not possible

293
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,992
Because her female things
are not alright

294
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,952
how they need to be.

295
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,159
Tell your wife to see me.

296
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,758
I mean in the ordination.

297
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,591
I don't know.

298
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:13,080
I don't know if he'll come to you
if it concerns the female things.

299
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,789
Some woman gets undressed here
even before she says hello.

300
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,151
-But Pavlina...
-A doctor is only a doctor.

301
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,629
But you're living with us.

302
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,955
So it's a little different.

303
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,955
Come in, mrs. Kodet.

304
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,552
What do we miss?

305
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,839
-Something serious?
-No, I'm fine.

306
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,313
I mean... nothing serious.

307
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,471
-Good day.
-Do you wish mrs. Kodet's file?

308
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,998
Yes, of course.

309
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,398
Please.

310
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,638
You can put your clothes here.

311
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I'd go to buy some lamb 
in the meantime.

312
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,151
I guess you'll manage, doctor.

313
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,314
No need to get undressed.

314
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,637
No need to check you neither.

315
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,355
-My husband said...
-I've changed my mind.

316
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,000
So you don't want to help us?

317
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,909
So I could examine you properly
I don't have proper equipment.

318
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,277
I'm not a gynecologist.

319
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,270
It'll be more reasonable
to send you to a specialist.

320
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,868
I know some.

321
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,392
It won't be a problem
to write a recomendation for Prague.

322
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,870
To you and your husband.

323
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,549
-But why would my husband...
-Both of you should go. 

324
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,349
It doesn't concern Petr.

325
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,796
Maybe it's because
I'm older than him.

326
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,875
I've got a feeling the difference
is every year bigger.

327
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,679
what's between us.

328
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,869
But Petr has never reminded 
that to me.

329
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,194
That's why I don't want
he had any problems because of me.

330
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,118
[knocking on the door]

331
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,153
[louder knocking on the door]

332
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,514
Doctor, you've got to go with me.

333
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,554
-What's that?
-Mum's bad. She's dying.

334
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,312
Heart, maybe. 
She got an outbreak.

335
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,678
How did it happen?

336
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,432
I'm to blame, I guess.

337
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,633
Mum sometimes quarell,
she doesn't know why herself.

338
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,511
When she fell, I thought,
she were playing that, but it was for real.

339
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,633
Why did you quarell?

340
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,440
When you mention to old Zitova about the highway,
what they'll build over her

341
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,079
she can explode, how he acts.

342
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,955
The girl is nuts as her.

343
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,798
Once she'll fell 
of the crock.

344
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,313
It's broken again.

345
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,232
It'll be better to stop.

346
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,200
Mum thinks that since we have this,

347
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,840
as a farmer girl, 
I've got better chance to get married.

348
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,398
Do you understand it?

349
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,235
Look for yourself
how it looks at our place.

350
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,356
Everyone can laugh at us.

351
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,833
I would like 
to see your mother now.

352
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,833
She's fine.

353
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,077
I'd like to see her anyway.

354
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,512
It can wait.

355
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,950
Now, I need you myself, doctor.

356
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,758
Will you help me?

357
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,711
And won't tell anyone?

358
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,392
The medical secret 
involves you too.

359
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,112
So what is it?

360
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,192
C'mon...

361
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,673
I'll have a child.

362
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,952
And what's next?

363
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,278
I don't want it.

364
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,273
And what's next?

365
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,439
-How next?
-Why don't you want it.

366
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,958
I won't tell.

367
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,360
How hard is it 
to understand that?

368
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,560
I've brought you here to see

369
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,560
what sty it is here.

370
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,120
If I had a child here

371
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,910
I'll be single forever,
and that would be

372
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,278
insane.

373
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,551
What month are you in?

374
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,638
I don't know.

375
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,111
Second I guess.

376
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,358
And who's the father?

377
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,114
-No one.
-I see.

378
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,313
You have to have it with someone.

379
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,038
I don't.

380
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,309
So when you figure out the name,
come to me to the center.

381
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,312
Marketa! What does the man wants here?

382
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,718
She thinks you're here 
because of the highway.

383
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,512
I'm a doctor, mrs.

384
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,078
I've come to see 
how are you.

385
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,830
I didn't beg for anything,
I'm healthy.

386
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,670
And I will be!

387
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,911
So that you all could be angry.

388
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,596
Marketa, throw him out!

389
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,600
If they'd get 
some good advocate,

390
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,831
he'll make some proper money
from the house.

391
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,194
Is Marketa going 
out with someone?

392
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,478
I'd say no.

393
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,312
She's not too into boys.

394
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,435
She dated only me.

395
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:18,640
[music]

396
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,393
Let be, I don't beg you for anything.

397
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,000
It was very well thought 
with the Prague.

398
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,515
-How could I know...
-Maybe not you.

399
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,116
But he... He surely does.

400
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,319
-Doctor!
-Please, don't cry, he'll hear you.

401
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,078
So be it!

402
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,277
Who knows if you're 
not conspiring against me.

403
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,152
And I fool didn't looked through
what were you making me into.

404
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,996
You know well, 
it's not like that.

405
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,319
No?

406
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,592
And how it is then?

407
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,071
Do you know what 
do you want from me?

408
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,994
So that people could 
point a finger on me.

409
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,749
-Look at the capon. No!
-Petr, be reasonable.

410
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,950
-It's silly after all.
-Silly?

411
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,993
Nobody knows about it.

412
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,078
-It'll stay between us.
-And what about him?

413
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,712
Doctor.

414
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,200
Please, don't make a scene.

415
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,957
Abortionists!

416
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,672
Petr!

417
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,469
-Where do you want to go like that?
-Don't touch me!

418
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,680
You can't do that to me.

419
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,118
Does it hurt?

420
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,878
And now?

421
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,712
What have you eaten?

422
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,638
You wasn't worried before,
don't be now.

423
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,035
Do you still want strawberries?

424
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:23,997
-How much did you take?
-I really don't want a child!

425
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,549
-More?
-No it's alright.

426
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:39,675
-You won't get rid of it like this.
-And how? When you don't want to help me.

427
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,398
It's too late.

428
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,311
I can help you.
To have a healthy baby.

429
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,997
-Screw you.
-What's up?

430
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,440
Nothing, usual percipidis.

431
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,509
-She ate something.
-Salami, yes?

432
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,832
People eat salami today.
It's simple.

433
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,952
Say, you jester?

434
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,150
She would use a free day,
so that she can get out of it.

435
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,159
Why not.

436
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,830
When you'll take for her,
doctor...

437
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,875
Making conductor in this hole,

438
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,917
a man will find his things.

439
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:30,153
One is getting married,
Kodet ran away...

440
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,914
And now the salami epidemy.

441
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:39,274
Could you find something for me
so that I could lie for a while too?

442
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:54,400
[cry of children]

443
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,958
Where did he go?

444
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,911
Kodet?
He's riding the buldozer 
on the highway.

445
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,391
He got a good job
and I lost a worker.

446
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,279
-With your help.
-Is she better now?

447
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,798
Yes. How come?

448
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,749
-People talks a lot...
-Something chronical?

449
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,799
Maybe Kodet talked himself.

450
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,590
Come here you patsy.

451
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,119
So...

452
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,118
You're said to pick 
in his privacy somehow.

453
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,400
-This is yours?
-Yes, the eldest.

454
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,235
I've got one more. 
And a little girl.

455
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,280
-But she's not counted as a child, is she?
-You don't live here, do you?

456
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,032
A mile from here.

457
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,034
I'd like to see him.

458
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,596
I've got a cold ear, don't I?

459
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,356
-It's such a dead bird.
-C'mon.

460
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:27,196
According to you, as soon as someone
is not like here and there, he's a dead bird.

461
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,952
You know, doctor, our Mirecek
is slower than other children.

462
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,237
But he was never ill.

463
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,995
Do you like to travel,
young man?

464
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,639
What would you say
for a trip to Hradec?

465
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,914
For, let's say, 14 days, 3 weeks,
mrs. Vlachova.

466
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,670
It's nothing serious,
a tiny innate defect.

467
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:12,110
For a child, it can be removed by a common
single surgery nowadays.

468
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,032
No, thank you.
I don't drink.

469
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,110
When you're back,
you'll chase boys like nothing happens.

[cry from the football field,

-If you're going to the football,
it's over. -Yes?

472
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,870
What nonsense are you doing?

473
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,992
Motion in fresh air 
doesn't harm to anyone.

474
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,633
Motion surely not.

475
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,439
But this could hurt you.

476

when mum decides to

477
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,074
or sacks with feed on the farm,
that's alright, isn't it?

478

They wouldn't force you to,
if they knew you're gravid.

479

Pregnant I mean.

480
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,037
You're worried
like you were my father.

481

Am I alike him?

-I can now!

645
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,672
What bait shall we use?

646
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,959
A buck's back with raisins.
That's the best.

647
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,788
-I can now.
-I'll show you! To the bed.

648
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:44,711
-Let him be!
-Let him be, Karel.

649
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,550
-Hooray!
-Let's go!

650
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:56,272
-He went over the floor. Is he gone?
-Now he can.

651
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:06,948
-Do you know the paragraph 7, Lojzik?
-I've never heard about it.

652
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,352
Come here, Karel.

653
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:19,320
Take it from them,
so that you'll do something useful.

654
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,958
Wait!

655
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:31,191
I see doctor prefers fish
before the teacher.

656
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:36,833
You're starting with it too?
I'll pour it on your head I guess.

657
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,598
Why on mine?

658
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,790
I didn't move him to Kodets.

659
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:54,920
In your age, Pulpan, it is
good to have a doctor in a cabin, isn't it?

660
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,592
Wait a moment.

661
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,600
If I knew you better from this view

662
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,558
you could live here long ago.
And all would be calm.

663
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,232
You know, locals aren't
acquainted with it.

664
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,275
Oh, now hang in there.

665
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:16,235
I see, colleague, you fell in it
like to a sewage.

666
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:21,557
Come have some too, Jaros,
so that your veins aren't shorter.

667
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,634
Give a finger to a hag,
she'll eat up you with boots.

668
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,519
I'll make warmer 
myself with a shovel.

669
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,197
I'm not fond of a female visits.

670
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,471
I see your destiny 
in black color, colleague.

671
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,717
-Why did he do it?
-I don't know.

672
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:58,837
I've always thought,
you understand each other.

673
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:12,516
If he'll come here, I'll ask him,
and then I'll tell you.

674
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,831
Maybe it was because of me.

675
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,436
He thinks so that I can go
somewhere with the child.

676
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:37,110
He's worried for nothing.
I'll keep him here anyway.

677
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,832
Don't speak like that.

678
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:48,029
If you knew, how am I,
between the empty walls.

679
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:54,797
-I wish you were back finally.
-You're still better than me.

680
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,910
Come. Come then.

681
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:05,316
Look at the hennery.

682
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,951
I'm going mad from 
their babble.

683
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,996
And all the snoring 
in the night.

684
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:27,350
Now I'll be able to go
into the garden at least.

685
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,998
Here it is.

686
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,270
End of visits. 

687
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,916
We're ending here.

688
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,551
End of visits, ladies.

689
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,078
Will you put it 
to your room?

690
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,952
Show me.

691
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,956
What did I say?
Ending, ending.

692
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,912
End of visits!

693
01:18:08,560 --> 01:19:21,070
[music]

694
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,238
Petr?

695
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:50,595
Oh God, where are you coming from?

696
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,474
I thought my husband is back.

697
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,511
How come they let you go?

698
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,435
And how did you come?

699
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,311
I escaped.

700
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:28,638
-You walked by foot?
-No car passed me.

701
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:40,154
Please, turn the light off,
it's stinging terribly.

702
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:59,274
Thank you, I'm better now.

703
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,912
Are you still here?

704
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,032
Yes, sleep.

705
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,592
Don't go away.

706
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,032
-What's up?
-Is Ota at home?

707
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,271
-Why?
-Marketa is going to give a birth.

708
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:52,512
-How come? They called from hospital?
-No, she's here at me.

709
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,513
Damn!

710
01:21:56,720 --> 01:22:00,679
-The rascal is not at home.
-Should I get someone else?

711
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,998
The doctor first.

712
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,472
Go!

713
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,790
You surely knows 
where he lives now.

714
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,918
No... Ah...

715
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,237
Go away!

716
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:29,193
I don't want you here! Not you!

717
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,913
Not you...

718
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,080
-Not you.
-Well well...

719
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:48,154
You'll be good.
Just patience.

720
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,119
Doctor will be here in a moment.

721
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:02,837
And he won't allow you to suffer.

722
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:22,078
When she was taken in the gynecology
in the sixth month,

723
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:26,431
it wasn't because they had free beds.

724
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,670
Or that I wished it.

725
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:38,317
-I didn't knew it was that bad.
-It wouldn't if she stayed there.

726
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,840
-I know she's headless.
-That's not headless

727
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,277
but a suicide.
And you gave her a knife.

728
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,597
I couldn't do nothing more.

729
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,432
It's a girl.

730
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,069
Where are the keys 
from the ambulance?

731
01:24:35,440 --> 01:26:15,920
[music]

732
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,388
Turn the siren on, doctor.

733
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,716
I can't find it.

734
01:26:25,800 --> 01:28:01,748
[music]

735
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:13,798
I'm sorry.

736
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:22,800
[sound of a siren]

737
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:28,033
I touched something and
I don't know what it was.

738
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,716
Show me, I'll go there myself.

739
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,158
Mrs. Zitova!

740
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,351
Open up, please.

741
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,718
Don't hide.

742
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,477
I know you're at home.

743
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,037
Mrs. Zitova.

744
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,350
I'd like to speak with you.

745
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,356
As in private or oficially?

746
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,392
Can you turn it off?

747
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,953
But briefly.
I don't have time for babbles.

748
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:48,550
[cry of babies]

749
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,432
Go.

750
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,315
-You can.
-I'm getting nuts too.

751
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:48,912
Nice girl.

752
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,313
She's all Marketa.

753
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:16,677
